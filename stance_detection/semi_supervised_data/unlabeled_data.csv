nobody gets charge with 34 and found guilty of at 34 unheard of lol
mother teresa wouldnt have committed 34 felonies stupid
inew york the voice of the american people making accountability great again
trump was charged with 34 counts of falsification of business records in the first degree which is a felony in new york he pleaded not guilty when he was arraigned last year in 2017 cohen and allen weisselberg an executive at the trump organization reached an agreement about how cohen would be repaid for the 130000 that he sent to daniels in exchange for her silence weisselberg detailed the calculations in handwritten notes that were shown to the jury at trial
its always glorious when reality bursts fox news bubble live on tv

hey trumpsters so much winning

how are 34 counts a first time offender only the 1st count was lock that liar up
so much winning lol
biden just got tough on crime and conservatives are not havin it
i find it funny some of you find joy in a man being persecuted wrongly put yourself in trumps shoes how would you feel if you worked so hard to protect your neighborhood for the hoa to wrongfully convict you i am sure some of you dumb idiots will not get what i just said
this is so stupid
the so called party of law and order has a convicted felon as its nominee sad and dusturbing
who could have possibly guessed that the biden weaponized doj would stack a jury with all commies to interfere with the 2024 election i knew pepperidge farms knew traitor joe knew
waterloo of satan donald john trump 185 68 253 god planned for trumps downfall and defeat and satan as well numbers dont lie i pray in the name of jesus christ he go to jail
lock him up lock him up
when we act with integrity we reinforce our commitment to truth justice and honor even if it means temporary discomfort staying true to our principles is essential
he is guilty of so much more how many on going lawsuits how many frivolous bankruptcy to avoid paying what people were owed how many lives destroyed depraved pathetic delusional destructive x dude
thanks yes thank you judge engoron and also many thanks judge merchan for giving the presidency to donald trump lol who is the btw the leading president at this moment thank you left brainless losers greetz from holland we need your help to mr president
be not dismayed for i am the lord you god pray believe thank him for his great love mercy and salcation of our god jesus saves
may 30th trump is found guilty here is some irony for those who have faith the feast day he was found guilty is joan of ark day she happens to be the patron saint of prisoners and the hero of patriots impressive if you ask me maga 4 life
found guilty no way trump was declared guilty in a kangaroo court all lies fox news should stop lying
this is witch hunt honestly
this doesnt mean anything my mom says rich white people if youd consider him white dont go to jail we just have to hope and pray that he loses the election then again if he does well have to deal with january 6th 2025
wow the comments are actually sensible surprising from fox
quick everyone send the billionaire your money to help him
im voting for him again
maga tears i love it melania hates trump this doesnt show up to trial funny how ur own wife hates i so much she dont show up to support u haha
and an incredibly dangerous door was just openedour government is going to to become more of a circus our country the great american experiment is now in its last days you idiots
trump 45 not anymore hes trump 34 as in 34 felony countslol
guilty of 1 count the same times 34 the us joined the rest of the americas a banana republic
the fact that biden says trump is crooked yet he has his political opponent who is higher in the polls charged for faulty charges just so he cant be in the election
lowkey i was not expecting the fox news comments to be like this
forever heretofore history shall recount and recall the 34 felony convictions of no45 the infamous phelonious trumpf who resides for eternity in the hall of shame
watch as the party of law and order goes on the attack against law and order
what are the mathematical odds of 12 jurors unanimously finding someone guilty on 34 counts you cant get 4 people to agree on pizza toppings
i hope you all are ready for the worst future you could possibly have they did this to make it harder if not impossible for trump to become a president again bet that judge either got a big pay day or had some dirt that would have been brought to light if he or she didnt play ball with big brother
cant believe this happened in united states if there is no justice for trump then there is no justice for anybody how this person juan merchan became a judge if there is no justice in his mind and career not professional at allvery disgraceful
trump storm the courthouse
obviously a fake trial to cripple his ability to run again since every poll says he will beat biden
in a nation worth living in in a democracy rather than an authoritarian state where people have constitutionally guaranteed rights and freedoms no one is above the law those who have lost their moral compass and regard for factual reality will disagree
if there is no justice for trump then there is no justice for everybody everybody can be treated like trump
who cares about what new york says anyway
i came here to gloat but everyone beat me to it lol nice to see were not so divided after all
i wonder what this means for the election if trump goes to prison who is gonna run for the presidential election does biden auto win i think that might be a first in american history where there isnt a candidate to run against a president in an election
hahaha bring a trump follower means two things 1 dumb 2 cult member
what an absolutely beautiful verdict a guy said sir thats a very beautiful verdict i love how president smokin joe biden weaponized the doj against his two presidential opponents that guy hunter biden and the other guy don the con drumpth go joe 2024
because convicted felon trump micromanaged his own trial abraham lincoln predicted its outcome why lincoln said a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client indeed trump is a fool and he not his lawyers is responsible for losing his own court case
if i was found guilty of 34 felonies no matter what they were i would go to prison trump is not above the law
trump refuses to accept reality this is not news
shame first line from the law and order republican party will be wear the felony convictions as a badge of honor
wow bye bye
hey maga tired of winning yet
how do you say first time offender with 34 felony convictions any other taxpaying us citizen would spend a decade in prison at least no trump wont see a second in jail because the system is not for our lords they are for the commoners
news flash orange rapist convicted of 34 minor felonies with many more serious charges pending in florida georgia and dc maga cult headquarters quotes lucille ball saying waaaaaaaaaaaa
unanimous decision on 34 counts in less than two days of deliberation can anyone say jury tampering
he will win anyway
trump your fired
who carestrump 2024
but biden cant even talk or protect our country lets immigrants pour in by the thousands he took showers with his daughter and has touched kids on camera he needs to be put to sleep and the evil man walks free and no charges bidens son does cocaine in his bathroom and the list goes on and on but of course that idiot got into office and has done nothing for americans god always wins and i pray biden gets whats coming to him until then good people suffer like always
there many that pray to the lord for you president trump
why do people still support fox news fox news is controlled opposition if it wasnt because they have dooped people in thinking that fox is right winger literally all media would be leftist and it would be easier to convince libatrds that they are the empire not the resistance
civil war 20 is on the way
trump the bigot trump the racist trump the rapist trump the liar trump the thief trump the coward trump the illiterate trump the wannabe dictator and destroyer of democracy in the us the putinwhipped trump the comrade to russia and trump the traitor to our country trump the lover of communists the world over trump the hater of the american military past and present because they are braver than he is trump the guilty felon 34 times over all thats missing is trump the incarcerated in a federal prison and trump the fertilizer
guiltyscumbag trump loser trump rapist trump felon trump worst potus in history fdjt
a message to the republican congress think about your children and descendants before you choose between democracy and dictatorship would you prefer them to grow up in a country like in russia north korea or united kingdom or australia
cant believe this happened in a great country united statesthis will not be a great country againhow this person juan merchan become a judge if there is no justice in his mindif there is no justice for trump then there is no justice for anybody those people who hold the notes says lock him upif they can lock him up then next time you will be the next one to be locked up by a judge without justice in his mind
i dont wanna see dat sleepy joe no more capiche djt
what about hillary or hunter biden
he was used he played the game within a plan to ruin humanity and is no longer needed simple
everyone who watched the trial knows it was completely unfair trump was deprived of many rights and everyone knows that new yorks judicial system is among the most flawed and crookedc systems in the country in any case he will not be sentenced to jail time if the judge has any integrity whatsoever even if he is sentenced to jail his sentence will likely be stayed until the appeal is completed and it is likely to be overturned on appeal no matter how you look at it this trial is an american disgrace alvin bragg is a puppet and a slimey spineless bottomfeeder
not able to sentence bro the hell
justice thank you lord
im not falling for this garbage im still voting for trump the democrats will do anything to throw this election im not surprised about the new york kangaroo court
i did hard time we need prison reform
trump was convicted by a jury not his political enemieswall street journal
guilty times 34 the jury has spoken he is and will be getting everything he deserves this country is repairable and joe biden is the man to do it what trump has done is a national disgrace to the office never in my lifetime have i ever seen anything like this
donald ask china they did it not me
no black man or person of color would ever be allowed to run for president let alone hold office f frump
this stupid witch hunt is ridiculous this will not stop him from becoming president 2024 donald trump will make america great again
since you all hate trump so much than you run for president and make america a better place
im not a big politician person or anything but i will agree trump did have a good run when he was president but for biden i cant say the same but since trump wont be reelected and biden definitely wont be voted for again whos gonna make america better since the man you all hate so much is finally in jail
judge should do whatever he wants to trump the judge has been harassed insulted everyday by that orange turd lock him up or home confinement at his crappy marlardo
just disgusting a rigged court cases a rigged justice system a witch hunt from the beginning biden and his hoodlems should be up for treason for stealing your tax dollars warmongering and moreput him on trial unbelievable usa is going down unbelievable go trump go
glad this criminal thug is getting the deserved prosecution now lets charge biden too dont be partial
bottom lineif he wasnt running for president none of these trials would be happening remind anyone of chinarussia
this will boomerang in a big way im seeing so many people walking away from the democratic party right now
i guess orange man was kinda bad after all
watch the trump snowflakes melt with this verdict and how is a jury of free thinking people a jury of his peers
whats truly pathetic is that one can predict what trump is going to saywhat right wing media is going to say and what his supporters are going to say and dour all pathetic bots who believe any and everything that spews out of trumps mouthim srry what do the evangelicals in this country call this adulterypredatorcongods mancame in the name of jesus rightclowns in a circus
stormy daniels need not leave this country
while ny judiciary makes the nation proud the sdny and main justicedoj still stinks 1 why didnt they pursue trump individual1 after he left office in jan 2021 2 why didnt doj pursue obstruction of justice charges recommended by mueller after jan 2021 3 why did they waste 125 years before starting to investigate trump and appoint a special counsel
is he the first president in history to be thrown in prison
us is making history a former president is adjudicated by a court as sexual assaulter in 248 years a president or former is criminally indicted for the first time in 248 years a former president is found guilty of felony in 248 years tbd a convicted criminal felon is going to be a presidential candidate
juror 2 gets his news from truth social yet there was an unanimous conviction imagine how strong the evidence is
now we can officially say criminal convict trump and criminal felon trump neither youtube nor the video publisher can remove it
lmao what a sucker and a loser
lying ted crooked hillary and sleepy joe will now have to surrender their nicknames to the expresident
karenbianco you are a former convicted felon who is voting for criminal trump in 2024 we dont want criminals as role models for our children in the whitehouse as president
ok so lets assume he serves one day for one count can you imagine trump in a jail cell for 34 days
finally wins a popular vote unanimous win
this is the most corrupted court case in the history they didnt fined any crime they prosecute him and they decide his guilty for crime that didnt exist this is we against
checkmate you cant obtain a security clearance if you are a convicted felon the potus must have a security clearance nice little move this was got the job done trump can run he can win but he cannot take office
democrats will run michele obama for president she will run on abortion issue wake up
about time trump made news exciting again
he finally won a vote
i love maga tears let it rain
ha so much for throw her in jail throw him in jail 34
not hearing any boooos from the crowd he sure has a collection of titles now convicted rapist and convicted felon oh and twice impeached lets not forget that one you seriously think this criminal should be running the country 999 of you wouldnt invite a rapist and felon to dinner at your homes but they are still qualified to be the president
its so funny how the comments trump makes about his trial are indistinguishable from the comments alex jones made during and after his trial
they didnt raid bidens house because biden let them search anywhere they wanted trump had 9 months to hand over the files and had his minions hide them duh you must think fox veiwers are morons
trump will be 47th president in november
couldnt happen to a better traitor
can the judge lose job for this miscarriage of justice
american justice has become a comedy show
trumps lawyers and the prosecution in common agreement chose 12 jurors the jurors took a closer look at the evidence more than you or me or anybody and it takes only one juror disagreeing on guilt to trigger the not guilty verdict how can anybody say that it was rigged
fox must be proud of themselves theyre as guilty as the rapst shame
love you trump i pray for you as you defend christians faith in all over the world god bless trump
surprised to see all the jubilation on the fox news comments section
rigged its a witchhunt etc lol
not rigged trumps lawyers chose the jurors its a trial like any other it just shows how he treats people
if he never ran for presidency again this never wouldve even happened
the sexualy liable abuser wife cheater tax evader draft dodger twice impeached four times indicted demented covicted sore loser is fully qualified to be the banana republican 2024 candidate
you gotta give it to donald he was right all along when he said no one did it like him no one lose like he does
it was a perfect guilty
convicted on all 34 counts thats 34 felonies and counting anyone else would get jail time hell get community service
and the western world outside the usa cheers with joy and relief yay to the republicans horrified and upset that his guilty i really dont understand what you see in trump this whole time trump either stirs or causes major trouble i seriously dont understand why you think that is a good quality for power
and the western world outside the usa cheers with joy and relief yay to the republicans horrified and upset that his guilty i really dont understand what you see in trump this whole time trump either stirs or causes major trouble i seriously dont understand why you think that is a good quality for power
maybe he shouldnt insult the people deciding his verdict lmao
proverbs 109 says people with integrity walk safely but those who follow crooked paths will slip and fall
i told him
trump is criminal do you understand hes a bad guy
we the people pardon trump
i thought hed get away with it paid zero attention to the trial
kwko5vh sure donate 500 to trumps convicted criminal reelection campaign and hell send you the passcode for his mar a lago estate there you will find boxes upon boxes of trial documents he and his mafia attorneys snuck out of court
finally he is held accountable for the first time is his entire life
dont want consequences dont break the law
so heres the question does he do time since hes convicted of 34 felonies he said he can relate to black people but most of us get convicted of 1 felony and were doing serious time or will this be just another jim crow stunt
hes gonna be 47
the lock her up crowd is now freaking out over lock him up i guess pronouns do matter
you dont go to prison unless you have violent related convictions a whole lot of white collar criminals doing 1020 would love to get that in writing
donald j trump is a felon 34 times the man is a one man crime wave for unscrupulous lots criticising usa system of justice i would remind ya all knuckleheads that with the ratification of the united states constitution in 1788 and the bill of rights in 1791 the rights of the people of the new united states of america to a trial by jury in both civil and criminal trials were secured meaning anyone criticising donald trump guilty plea is unfit for public office why thats how usa deal with criminals for over 300 years because a rapist fraudster extremely incompetent businessman is a one man crime wave and gop still made him nominee despite warnings from chris christie for what prisoners context thats on ya all not on usa system of justice
dtrump is simply a viscious cult bully and is dangerous to this country my family are professionals and military officers and left the republican party this year we were done with his maga cult even nixon stepped down and away after committing crimes trump was not smart enough to walk away with all his crimes because his family is a brainwashed viscious thug cult family period
just came for the comments
ya gotta love it liar and con man crooked trump convicted on 34 felony counts hope he gets life in prison without parole thank you jurors
cant wait to see the total maga meltdown
classic eating popcorn watching the video and reading the comments type situation going on here
what gets me the most is that one who isnt native boen he cant be president yet trump a convicted felon can everyone on the right keeps yelling about political opponent argument but they forget trumps 2016 lock her up to clinton for just existing i guess when trump wants to do that to a political opponent whose done nothing then trumps conviction has nothing to do with political opponent because biden has nothing to do with anything the hypocrite was found guilty yell about the jury both defense and prosecution pick jurors both have to agree on who stays and goes trump is guilty get over it trumpers trump is a loser again and if he appeals he gets to just like anyone else not an exception
haha all the trump sheep mad in the comments
only psychopaths with little to no conscience support donald trump the bible said in the latter times men will have their conscience seared with a hot iron
people that still have a working conscience found trump guilty years and years ago
do all you people gloating know that hillary clinton was found by the fec guilty of the exact same crimes she was found guilty by a federal agency of illicitly using campaign funds to fund the steele dossier the document that started the entire russia collusion hoax this is fact it in the official records now its not fox news disinformation do you know that she was found guilty by them for hiding the payments as legal fees by falsifying her records do you know that all she got was a slap on the wrist an 8000 fine click on a new tab and search hillary clinton campaign finance fine and read one of the articles available on left leaning new sites and learn for yourself just be honest and tell us you are perfectly fine with half of your fellow americans living under a different set of rules laws and consequences spare us you trying to argue the facts
anything that is in favour of crown trump he will thump up anything that is against him he will scream and shout on top of his voice this is political persecution political motivated or peoples who do the right thing against him are scums hence how would he be statesman where he does not obey the rule of law is he a man of jungle as he believes the law of jungle his mother was right who voted for crown trump he is either a gullible or a moron
after reading some of these comments i had to double check the video to make sure i was watching the video from fox news
truly interesting how many comments show how woke many still are
why anyone would think this rogue judge and his handpicked jurors would have come up with any other verdict is ridiculous note in ny only 4 jurors need to vote guilty on each count out of 12 jurors that is anything no not unanimous nor is it considered unanimous in other states such a dog and pony exhibition and msm shut their mouths about biden authorization of muntions force from us in russia
trump maga 2024 we will not back down we want justice
guilty as charged
i guess all former president should be charge hey and the one right now
trump was supposed to be in jail way back instead all these rich people helped him to get him in president and after the term he get away with it what a bs government is soo slick n smooth
ill still vote for trump even if he goes to jail it beats having biden
good morning usa i got a feeling that its gonna be a wonderful day
hillary has a body count listed online trump was convicted of mislabeling paperwork
in addition to being convicted on all counts as a person of color orange theres a strong possibility that hell be given a maximum sentence
so riddle me this how can a felon still be free and not in jail and let alone still run for president is that just how bad our system is for rich
please no more close ups of the creature from the orange lagoon
so whens biden going to be arrested since he was the first who got busted for hiding documents
wht does google censor my posts
google is sensoring my posts is google a commie pig corp
suck it faux news i mean fux newskeep trashing america and now the justice systemlove it or leave itorange is the new red
trump is guilty its not hard to make that assertion if you pay attention to what is actually said and done in the court room except people cant seem to abstract politics and their hatred for the other team long enough to think clearly rationally and objectively anymore i am no democrat dont really support biden and that has zero to do with the fact that trump was guilty he just does the same old song and dance every time blame every one and every thing else but himlike a child no matter how much this guy claims things are rigged evidence evidence evidence simple
more guilty counts than oj simpson
im so glad they found him guilty he needs to realize nobody is above the law he doesnt care about us or america its all about him jail i hope
the judge da and biden dont forget the gag order you still have to be sentenced watch what you say
so donald trump has at least sexually assaulted stormy daniels ivana trump his ex wife ejean carroll thought was his ex wife youd be ignorant to assume thats the only women he poked with something against their will
these people have committed treason
to all the trumpersim sorry about that sorry buddy
america gets to choose between a hair smelling ice cream eating dimensia suffering old man and a narcissistic felon is that the best that usa has to offer
four more years
false accusations huh
and dont forget president trump will win november 5th 2024 and those real criminals that committed real crimes with overwhelming evidence will finally pay if this country is yet turned upside down
republicans need to start thinking about a plan to replace trump as the nominee before the rnc convention instead of engaging in stupid and futile protests outside the nyc courthouse
4 years per case he goona be living like a king inside the joint come on who really thinks hes gonna spend there years in prison
blaming biden administration how ignorant can you be
donald trump is a felon running for president the law is to be respected but he really trying to look innocent
cry republicans
trump 2024 all the way if he goes to prison i will still vote for him
convicted felon donald trump he couldnt even get a job a many fast food places with his criminal record
crybabies all in the comments
3434 convicted felon rofl
well still be voting for trump even if hes locked up we the people can see that this is a kangaroo court a judge whose daughter is working for democrats with the jury from a deep blue state when biden dared trump to debate we knew something was off biden already knows the result of this trial
good thing i never gave up my guns and ammo
good lock him up
shame on fox for covering up the face of that sexy nypd officer standing by the door
what a big steamy pile the wrong person was found guilty
but yet joe biden still is free with hillary and omamawhat a joke
new york is full of dumb asses
so let me see if i get this straight i have to pass a background check to be a cashier at stop and shop yet a convicted felon gets to run for president of our country can somebody make sense of this because i sure the hell cant
so confused what did he do
well there you go a precedent has been set to go after former presidents if no one is above the law doors open for retro prosecution to include a few representatives senators judgesand the list goes on i think our forefathers are rolling over in their graves truth has been hijacked and ill also bet if you look up at the statue of liberty she is weeping the only thing this solves is dividing us even further divide and conquer
i seriously dont think he should be convicted of 34 felonies when all he did was send hush money to stormy daniels to say that she didnt sleep with him i think its sabotage so he cant run as president
tons of dem bots on commenting in this guilty verdict on all news outlets
sexual abuse stormy is literally on national tv in 2018 in front of millions of people saying there was no abuse it was consentual and even defends him she says i am not a victim verbatim you libs have the literal brain of a goldfish
people can protest peacefully all they want but that wont change the verdict and thank god we dont have a justice system based upon personal opinion
trump lawyer looks like he has just realizedhe aint getting paid
not surprised he was found guilty he is guilty
i dont hear any boos
lock him up be careful fox you dont want to have to pay another seven hundred million dollar fine for knowingly spreading lies
trump need new lawyers
yay trump is a felon
hold up biden slow your roll while grinning from ear to ear thinking this has put you that closer to crossing the finish line to victorythe true winner donald trump will be back
we all know this is bs get enough people to lie and this is what happens but they wont touch their criminal biden
appeal to supreme court not guilty violation of constitutional rights and a denial of due process god bless america and trump
this is what happens when you remove nikki because shes a woman
those jurists were either bought or threatened
maga you have made trump your god god says to put no other god before him this was your warning
the real verdict is going to be on november 5 if i win of course otherwise its rigged again
im so proud of those crying ladies out at the courthouse maga
why does trump want to send loaded missiles to israel
lol this presenter reading off the guilty verdicts sounds like she is at an auction haha
trump qnd his followers cant stop crying what happened to the once great republican party orange stained
remember donaldtwelve minded people found you guilty of all charges face up to the fact that sensible people get the right verdict your supporters have yet to find their brains and morality
narsisist never accepts defeatneverwhat a loser
a reality is just what we tell each other it is sane and insane could easily switch places if the insane were to become the majority you would find yourself locked in a padded cell wondering what happened to the world in the mouth of madness 1994
paytriot give your money to a campaign if you want to fools haha its all a fake stage show they are laughing all the way to the bank im keeping my hard earned useless paper fiat
all major republican and democratic political strategists know that the only candidate likely to beat biden in the presidential election was nikkey haley except unfortunately the majority of republican supporters trump cannot win the presidential elections
only donald trump will get convicted with 34 cases and some being felonies and not going to prison thats wild people drive and get a dui and jail time for a misdemeanor
i prefer presidents who dont have 34 criminal convictions felon
shame trial
what else to expect from a kangaroo court
make america great again put trump in prison
tired of willing stinky
34 guilty convictions trump the felon
lock this felon up
i once had an uncle like trump he was a nononsense guy and that was very intimidating to lazy and stupid people normal hard working people liked him but twofaced grifters in our family couldnt stand him
if they applied this much scrutiny to every politician at least 80 of washington would be behind bars for 10 years
i dont hear any boos
another john kennedy
i am glad am not an american cause this right here is a disgrace
this whole situation is crazy because trump also broke 34 rules created by the supreme court for more information on the topic look up trump rule 34
amazing how everything is rigged only when trump loses
no one is above the law justice has prevailed wonder if this is also what the donald meant by making america great again
this is great news now the independents and republicans can vote libertarian and we can get this country and our freedom back
watch him still win this november lmao
yet biden is still able to be a president
the world stage done got desperate
send trump to cecot
a political conviction dont trust them
when i saw many deluded trump cultists reacting to the verdict i am reminded of a quote when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross this is the best example that no one is above the law it emphasizes that all citizens and institutions including lawmakers and leaders are accountable to the same laws and this concept ensures that no individual or group can act with impunity regardless of their standing or authority and yes this actually applies to donald j trump sadly this is something that these cultists will never acknowledge or understand
crazy how even after trumps presidency liberals cant stop thinking about him trying to put him in jail throw shade on his name im not trumps biggest fan did i vote for him yes but because he was the better option at the time but its really sad considering there is so many crimes liberal politicians have committed and should have gone through the same court processes as trump funny that liberals only seem to want law and order when it fits in with their political agenda people need to start standing up or its just gonna keep getting worse
is all this winning rigged as well magas guilty on all counts
an opportunity for him to make more money from his criminal verdict trump couldnt even stand up to defend himself inside the court but keeps whining spreading his lies outside the court this guy will live his life as whining and lying
this clown thinks that he could use his infantile theatrics and distractions to convince everyone that he is not a thief liar con artist racist and a pu33y grabbing clown moron that does not like a bathe and smell like spoil cheese
is trump still under that stupid gag order even though the trial is over or can he say whatever he wants now cuz i hope he can speak freely now like everybody else
so a felon cant vote but can run for president where they do that at lmao go directly to jail do not collect 20000 whats next war
he needs to be removed from the presidential candidacy
the russians putin compromised trump years ago and supported 200 trumps bid to become president they weaponized the fbi and judicial system all because putin wanted to invade the ukraine without nato response trump sold out american democracy system to make a buck those who support him are either stupid corrupt themselves of delusional
lol good orange buffoon
this is a fantastic verdict of 340 now lock up this criminal
god is good this the lord work
now if we could just get rid of fox news for spreading lies 247 we will be on our way to unifying the country that they have divided
yet they wont release the private island client listhmmm seem like something very democratic is happening here
the republican party is a criminal enterprise isnt it
donald trump is not a republican a real republican would not have tried to overthrow the government that he vowed to protect when he became president and you know that is true this is how a real and respectful republican should and did leave the office of president in his farewell address to the nation ronald reagan said we must always remember that our strength lies in our respect for the constitution and the bill of rights and our determination to preserve it for our children and their children
lock her up lock her up ooops they gonna lock him up for reals
just as donald didnt care about those who got in trouble for supporting his will to attack the very government that he promised to protect and honor when he became president donald will not take responsibility for his own nasty behavior now young angry people that support him now if they become violent again could end up incarcerated donald could protect them from their own anger by admitting that he was wrong and that his own behavior is the reason he has a guilty verdict in the court but he wont because he doesnt care how much his idolizing followers suffer its all about the donald what a selfish man
im so sad may god help and guide president trump during this difficult time
if the republican party had any brains and wanted to go back to true conservatism they would have a new candidate by monday i cant stand donald trump or joe biden i would vote for a moderate conservative over joe biden in a heartbeat no more sociopath con man we dont need a trump want to be
cant fix stipid sell them a red hat show them fox news done
itll be funny to see the trump supporter comments
all you liberals better watch yo mouth you gonna be crying when hes president again and can actually form a sentence unlike the president we have now
dump the effing gop trash fox is as corrupt as the cult
michael cohen got jail time for nonviolent crimes trump organization accountant got jail time for nonviolent crimes if trump doesnt get jail time it just proves that our criminal justice system is trash no one should be above the law
its funny how many of you think this bars him from election
lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up

hes no longer allowed to run for presidency right since he is a felon a criminal
with 34 felony convictions in 1 day trump is a mass convicted felon why is it that a new york jury selected fairly by prosecutor and defense was able to do what congress failed to do during 2 impeachment proceedings
dont do the crime if you cant do the time
for any of us a key factor in our sentencing would be how well we conducted ourselves in the eyes of the judge during the trial
finally accountability for the orange clown criminal
first president to be found guilty over all the 45 we had even with all the scandals that have been going on its only him to be pushed to court this is a banana republic government tactics to get what they want because certain politicians are a threat is this really a free county and justice for all does the government really up hold the constitution if you are in power are you really above the law are we the people just pawns in this game
whoevers cheering are dumb if they think that weaponize government is a good thing they should be afraid we are becoming a third world country
all those things sean hannity tucker carlson ingraham and all the other fox news people said about other presidentscandidates having to remain in office even when they are being prosecuted or investigated karma came for everyone in this case
even if trump is found guilty you will never see him in jail i bet a million dollars jails are for poor people and rich people is above the law simple
integrity first service before self excellence in all we do loyalty duty respect selfless service honor integrity courage commitment these are samples of the core values across our military branches of which i was proud to serve in now sit there and tell this vet how you thank us for our service while you support a man who embodies none of these values character matters we must demand at least as much from our president and ourselves as we do from our armed forces
galtism1519 no point was missed if all you can do is talk about the color of a suit as if theres some comparison to the criminal conviction by a 12person jury of a corrupt criminal felony expresident you are the weakest link
its official new york is a banana republic shame on you new york
he didnt do anything wrong were you there to see it blinded by love
d0n removed on 68
if being prosecuted for crimes is election interference maybe he shouldnt have committed all those crimes
34 convictions and that doesnt include january 6th on that day alone he committed at least 10 crimes
trump is a criminal
judge merchan needs to go to jail one of the most corrupt judges i have ever seen
trump fans dont use the internet or what i came to fox news specifically looking to be entertained by them
if he wins the election he could swear in the office while serving time in prison dang i dont want to miss this
125 crazy that trump has been able to pay off people so long to never be held accountable but when he is not able to pay off people he is found guilty
accountability
the new world order was convicted of 34 counts of tyranny yesterday now a lot more people are awake
absolutely corruptthe entire system
2 impeachments a criminal conviction what a disgrace
enhance your satisfaction by understanding your existence se arch existnc
this was a witchunt
this world is evil hate is an awful disease i have no respect for biden but i have no hate except for what he does the hate for trump is the democrats true soul
if you think things are out of control now just wait until biden is reelected it will make the blm movement look like a sunny day in the park it will be out of control for most law enforcement and the military may need to step in many dont like biden and dont want him to be reelected im not 100 sure about trump either but it will be 1000 times worse with biden
what kinda sentence did the last new york criminals who were convicted of the same thing receive just out of curiosity
trump is a gemini what you expect
no one wanted to prosecute this case because well there was no crime to prosecute so biden realizing that voters are aware that he biden is destroying the country sent for bragg and ordered him to charge trump with something anything a democrat donor judge was picked and a democrat jury to insure evidence would be berried and of course trumps found guilty july 11th trump will be sentenced to 134 years in prison and biden will be reelected see mail in ballots no id needed good plan to usher in fascism
so sad the lady parts grabber is bigly guilty
why shouldnt trump be sentenced to prison lots of corrupt first time offenders have gone to prison rod blagojevich micheal cohen and soon to be bob menendez
justice has been served and more to come as a person who doesnt believe in the imaginary sky daddy of the bible god is good all the time
i only wanted trump to win the 2024 election for the president ai memes
yea total bullsht none of this amounts to sht phoney charges trumped up politically driven court of nonsense to interfere with an election if this keeps up the people are gonna lose their patience with the process and the people running it and then you will get a real insurection with real violence from a really angry populace
fox news is a joke just like forked tongue trump the people have spoken guilty the plug will be pulled soonno more trumpism
good i kniw white people pissed right now
so many maga tears i love it
party of law and order pretty upset about law and order
civil war is coming
guilty
everyone here is missing the bigger picture if this man can financially influence the elections who else you think can do it every one of them politicians have financial ties to elections they just happened to throw him out to dry
even the likes dislikes ratio proves how stupid american voters are they are mentally children that are told who to vote and are scared or going to jail if they dont vote
trump for prison 2024
yep thats well only happen in blue states thats jurors despise trump because of feelings not because of the truth it is a sad day that a former president and a person that has not committed a crime has found guilty of bogus charges
definitely my best fap
ignorant theres no way the payment was hidden or hush money when every news station told us about the 100000 stormy daniels payment the day the settlement happened many years ago
crazy times incredible
trump is innocent trump represents the majority of the american and australian people let america and australia great again biden and his adult diapers are not fit to be reelected the deep love from aussie for the president trump
just makes me a bigger trump fan will work harder to get him back where he belongs
ill still vote for trump even if he isnt on the ballot socialism is taking over this country it must be stopped
he needs off the ballots it didnt take a court case to see he was a con and criminal he been doing this since daddy been showing him as a kid
of course the cesspool of humanity found him guilty
my guess is that this is going to the supreme court and business will be handled there also i like how trumps incident with stormy daniels occurred before the election of 2016 why didnt they try to charge him thencoincidentally they are deciding to charge him 5 months before the election gtf out of here they are simply trying to jail bidens political opponent they know trump will win and they are now deciding to try and jail him 5 months before the election
average americans convicted trump lets go trumpless we need to celebrate our rule of law doing the job
trump lawyers will go down as the worst lawyers in history
im still voting for trump the first guilty president because america is guilty biden is guilty
i hope the sentencing goes as well as the verdicts
why should he not go to jail if we did it we woul go to jail
no its not sad its official hes now a true politician guilty of crimes now lets move forward and get it back in office
lunatic fox meltdown ha ha ha trump guilty
hey donald where do i send you a few bucks which jail oh your going to need a metal dipper otherwise you will lose your virginity
going to be the first president while being put on an ankle monitor and house arrest
the jury make america great again
this is how you make america great again
far left really did everything to bring mr trump down
theyll all be reversed obviously
republicans gotta move on from this clown
the former republican president of the united states has been found guilty of 34 felonies and fox only post a 2 min 36 sec clip of it if this was biden it would be hours and hours long
lock his azz up
theres no russian trolls here commenting because they dont want this video to get views
celebrate good times
finally the country is divided let it see who is who some of them support trump the other side savage hoomosexuals full of rage
well its about freaking time
don the coneligible for prison now please make this happen
handwriting on the wall anyone cherishing freedom leave
guilty of what this is nothing but a clown showthe jury was bought and paid for
undoubtedly trump is guilty on some of this but i have never heard of a firsttime offender being found guilty on all charges unless they were like a serial killer you would think that satan was put on trial
this must be interfered by zhina chinese ccp paid the juriesbought each of them a burger
if it was oj simpson it be innocent
im honestly not surprised they jury knew how this would end before openings
this is great verdict big applause for the jury for seeing that he is a criminal i always knew bruce wayne had shady dealings and finally they came to light no more buying weird offshore materials now on to lex luthor
its all a reality tv show to hype up the uneducated liberals these counts will never get passed by supreme court
this what you do in a third world country putin and russia cuba venezuelas is this what you want your country like it was a democrat party is trying to do with the crooked judges justice department
democrats have gone too far this time because of their blinding hate from now on any politician even biden should be take to court for any reason all these liberal judges and das should be taken to court no one is above the law as soon as biden is out of office in 6 months immediately take him to court in say texass most conservative area
republicans dont want felons voting for president just running for president
new world order dont want trump he is not in the club the clintons had waaayyy more controversy around them but because they are apart of the club it got swept under the rug
still not voting democrat
he said that he was a very innocent man
its so over for bro hes cooked
he did it to himself
this country is a embarrassment to the whole world sad
trumps felony conviction puts him on the mafias most wanted list
finally
politics has fallen to the lowest when you tell your kids commit all the crimes you want and aspire to be a convicted felon half of america dont care and want you to be their world convicted felon president
do not expect the courts especially the supreme court to provide justice we must vote blue and remove the corrupt ԙpubliʞaи party from all offices vote blue
so much winning 3434 thats a freaking 100 fuwk me thats hardcore wheres the transformers criminals are hot meme when you need it
trump you lost the popular vote by 22 in 2016 and by 48 in 2024 you will lose by double digits in 2024 your bots show you ahead in the polls but bots dont vote
trump is a convicted criminal found guilty on all 34 counts all unanimous that says a lot
you can have the rule of law or you can have trump the dictator but you cannot have both vote blue
in trumps imaginary world he will win the 2024 presidency first executive order remove criminal background checks from the employment process
what a joke
im sure its all a fake lie and big hoax and everyone in that courtroom is against him in the whole world is against trump this is our fake news and obama wearing his tan suit was way worse than this theres no way distinguished gentleman that likes to grab them by the py could do any of these things
trump is guilty period fox news please stop the bias reporting its pathetic
so how are we taking our country back from these criminals
dirty dog is guilty of everything
trump and his lawyers gambled and played with judges and juries like slot machines he finally hit the juryjackpot
buy silver today immediately its going to explode in value
and this just in judge merchans daughter is voting for trump
777skeptic obama is not a criminal which would you prefer blue suit prison cell or tan suit clean record and right to vote
rigged election rigged judicial our government has fallen very sad
trump said im fighting for our constitution in his posttrial speech its the same constitution he said should be terminated can you say hypocrite
once again all jury deliberation involving trump are always unanamous verdicts or indictments by ordinary people
every time a jury of ordinary citizens have been asked to look at the evidence against trump they have unanimously returned an indictment against him or a guilty verdict the only ones ignoring trump criminal behavior is the ԙpubliʞaи cult i say again its always unanamous
trump is not running for president he is running away from jail the most incredible thing in the us today is a cult that wants a convicted felon as its dictator believe trump when he says he wants to be a dictator
the crooked corrupt biden democrats and their corrupt doj minions are despicable hope karma comes around
should make him illegible to run for office now
lets see what the fox bots are angry about today ah they still want their dictator
just like the mueller investigation into russian collusion boris johnsons voteofconfidence w 148 mp votes to remove him this investigation will officially clear trumps name historically trump will be the next potus dems quit in 23
off in the far distance i can faintly hear lock him up lock him up is that you melania as i get closer yes it is
is he still allowed to run for president
why likes are so low and slow
what a dirt bag his rap sheet os bigger than most convicts in jail
joe biden is a boss
well whaddaya know the system still works good on you new york now lets go for a fair sentence
maga tears on the horizon
our country is absolutely doomed not because of this verdict though this verdict was great our country is doomed because its full of easily manipulated low iq cult followers that will worship a man despite any evidence thats presented to them its just so sad
justice
when trump wins the election the salt will flow greatly and i will be there to laugh at the tds cult members
no one is above the law in this great country
good this is real news not fake news
justice wins i hope the americans can draw the right conclusions from this conviction i come from germany and without the war of the allies we would have received a military dictatorship like in north korea i am grateful for that please dont break your great country
lock him up lock him up lock him up
hes innocent trump 2024 appeal
trump 2024 years in prison
cope harder morons
in other news hunter is caught butt naked and free not quilts
so as a convicted felon he cant own a gun but if hes elected president he can have the launch codes for our nuclear arsenal
im surprised it took this long
welp i guess biden will be reelected
things arent looking good for the orange man cult
you all are invited to the trump pity party because everything is always someone elses fault always loser
biden still wont get reelected trump 2024 this will all be overturned by appeal because this was rigged from the judge to the jury
fasten your seatbelts trumplican traitors it is going to be a bumpy night and there are three more trials to go
