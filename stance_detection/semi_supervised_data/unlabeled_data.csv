we want to see like this kind of debate in our country india modi vs rahul gandhi
wish cnn can host this debate for nigerias presidential candidate
u need to restrict or change the situation in uses and buying of guns in united states
look at trump man so fit tough n alpha god bless that man
biden should take rest home for the aged let trump manage america hes active and energetic
are you sure this biden is not an ai robot
biden will vote for trump
trump rightmany american needs helpbut biden donate billion dollar to other counrty
so this was not a political debate it was a shit talking session when biden can complete a sentence that is
lets talk about whos better at golf
its weird to see mark look human still a scumbag i dont trust him
trump never look at biden and thats good for him not seeing him in the eye
why then are there still so many homeless veterans who are trying to survive out on the streets i see someone who was a veteran and is sleeping rough on the streets of new york he does live videos on tiktok in the hope that people will help him to get off the streets his name is michael smithson look him up what kind of help did he get he used to be a marine for christ sake a former marine who is sleeping rough on the streets of nyc he wasnt taken care of when he came home disgraceful
is there any other candidate
when biden said your the sucker your the loser lollll
holy shit this was hilarious
does anyone notice that biden has signs of cva
give me some subtitlesim sorry biden
what happened to bidens voice
trump under joes administration the whole world is under him true aye
i wish trump is the next president of united state i like him
wtf is going on with joe elder abuse for real
trump is a con man who seeks to divide american society racism is being used as a weapon by a president who represents the interests of billionaires like him the whole thing is a hoax we have to be smart about donald trumps racism first its a political strategy this is donald trump as a con man his game is to cause racial hatred and then turn around while society burns the broader strategy is to say that some people are undeserving and that is why we need to dismantle government programs that transfer wealth from the rich to the rest of society the illegals are crossing they are robbing you they are invading our hospitals they are invading our schools thats the rhetoric but underneath that is a policy agenda that says cut entitlements social security health care funding for schools for clean water for our cities for our rural areas the political agenda narrows in government programs that require high taxes on the rich
always donald trump love and regards from india
biden mean while me
poor joe needs to number his thoughts number 1 number 2 number 3
watching this from the philippines i am amazed that trump debated with chat gpt
in india like this interview not possible
america is cooked fr
we need trump to make america great again god bless america america
i support trump also cuz he the one actually put america back to right thing although not good like anarchy but at least better than the one keep using ukraine as a cash cow
cnn is a very biased news channel i came here to see the comment trump made on bidens son who took 3 million dollars as a bribe but they have deleted that part also what sort of question is that you will accept the results no matter what
i m watching this after the incident god bless american public
so sad that american citizens have a president that can hradly speak up
one is aged and incapable and the other stupid and lier only burnie sanders deserve for president chair he is jenious and wise person but both parties have agenda to nominate these puppits
hearing biden talk makes my head hurt
watching from thailand
its like a family fight paternal vs maternal side
i feel sad for usahow come biden running electionhe can not walk safelyhow he will run usa
theyre just roasting each other cant you just answer the damn question i think cnn brought them to express their grieviences against each other because im not seeing anything like a debate here trump talking biden biden talking trump
2406 when you start making personal comments on your opponents you lost biden lost the debate here
please tell what is true king amen the world 99999999999999999
today i appeared in front of the international media with sadness and exhaustion sheikh hasinas government is practicing the killing of innocent students in bangladesh why is the international media silent why are you not having an official dialogue with international powerful leaders so can you avoid responsibility with hasinas government i want the final answer from you
biden to old for this
biden the fact of the matter is 123me4fall asleep
biden need to take vacation and live the life and leave precedency to trump
biden is truly an inspiration to defeating alzheimers every few seconds
i think trump is better for american because if he do nothing but can laugh the people of america and also me from his uniq face and
ive been fighting for 5 years to get va spousal pension and i am still fighting with the va very sad
did biden had a facelift botox or whateverhe looks so stiff and scary
if donald trumph won then everything will be formal and i wish him in power regards from india moral support to donald trumph
a notorious liar who messed up his country left politics in britain another notorious liar in politics hopefully leaves soon liars are like alcohol highly addictive but you know it doesnt help
democrats are mean how dare they abuse this old man
joe biden are you ok guys whats happening here he looks really sick and unhealthy and unwell bless his heart trump looking like you ok joe joe
sorry but yall democrats need to take voting more seriously clearly you guys want someone to manipulate not lead it will back fire though when the us is in real danger and needs an ethical god fearing president
honestly it seems that biden is the epitome of the democrats voting for someone they can manipulate and yes i see much delusion and elder abuse
yall im actually starting to feel bad for biden
i still would vote for biden its not even close i dont care who runs on the democratic ticket i will still vote blue i dont know what will happen i hope its not trump whoever it ends up being i just hope that this grand experiment called america can survive without imploding
800 is hilarious this feels like trump vs biden twitch ai
who would want biden as president after watching this hes all over the place
i pray to god protect the americans i cant believe biden is the president of america
am from namibia i need a girlfriend
only trump 2024
we hope no ww111 regarding various clips and predictions
did president j biden have a brain transplant
we know about nancy pelosisus
looking at bidens countenance he is soso lost in space imagine having a president like this scary no doubt on the other sidetrump his is so clear this is the guy we need i want to be my president no f doubt maga
trump is right biden is wrong for example the wars would never have happened as straightly said by trump a leader should have a good hearts farsightedness like trump and not like biden who encourages war
only insane person will vote for this radical man you are proving people arent respect u s president right and look yourself addressing our best president ever and you respect and for this country youre a liar
triumph you werent even doing any debate with all your these baseless points talkless of showing 1 ability to rule usa god forbid you come back to white house as our president youre so radica senseless person
i dont understand their english too much but trump seems speaking confidently than biden
where did that porn comes from in the debate
joe biden makes other countries and presidents laugh at america because they see him as the weakstupid person who represents america
to say that russia was able to take a lot of land from bush obama and biden but unable to get any from trump is a great plus to trump i must acknowledge that
biden the idea of 1 2 3
wife of trumprussia hoax peddler indicted in us court as a foreign agent
the way biden laughs when trump speaks he should be given a free ticket to the white house for the second term
cnn what the hell is this trash repeating clips at 815 and 1140 did anyone look at this before uploading or did you have your unpaid intern do all of the work
joe looks so confused for the entire debate what an embarrassment of a president
president trump walks in like its an mma bout hes got nuthin but a g thang playing in his head
joe is falling asleep listening to the person talking in his ear piece lol
the roast of trump biden not presidential debate
this is sad honestly
both are too old 78 tr 83 jd we need an another one
does biden even know where he is
why are you looping this cnn
trump fell during speech lie
americans did you know the whole world is laughing about you
trump stated facts this was hard to watch
trump speaks the truth biden is deranged and deluded as is cnn
biden just sounds old and tired trump is a convicted felon who hates immigrants pick one 2353
they are old could have given them seats atleast to stand there for so long at that age even the age 30s man will get tire
joe biden couldnt finish a complete sentence and lies like a rug america needs president trump back and that albatross deserves to be in jail
lol no subtitles theres no ai able to understand wtf are these two old grannies saying
i cant stop laughing
go for trumph love from philippines
go for trumph love from philippines
trump said i aint knockn him or i aint knockin anybody for it this man been the goat
i support the democrats but this is just sad biden was falling asleep mid debate
biden dr falsey is joe biden guy another man needs cuffs like his son and him and obama hillary his whole crew facts
wow he belives this biden what he says iys crazy
look at this guy biden look around like where i am earnpiece is telling what to say its the most terrible choice the american people made voting for this whole group horrific every last agenda group a joke
i really dont like the fact that alot of you all are trying to pick on biden its called being a bully and is so lame grow up vote for who you want and shut the fuck up already this is why biden is at were hes at and your at were your at
i had a 6 handicap i had an 8 handicap joe biden challenges trump to carry a golf bag cant find his way off stage without the easter bunny and uses the political process to punish his political adversaries in typical leftist democrat neofascist style
republicans arent the ones who use the political process to punish their adversaries democrats do that republicans arent the ones who try to silence people democrats are republicans arent the fascists democrats are
biden speaks like the president of zambia
only voters knows best
i am not from the usa but i admire trump americans if you want to save america vote for trump
is cnn a right wing network now i cant believe they would air these moments even democrats are going to vote for trump after this
dude trump brought up afghanistan and biden shit his pants possibly literally that was the best ahh dammit face ive ever seen
if you ask joe what he discussed or what happened on this day he would not remember jill biden should be charged with elderly abuseembarrassing
gusto naman joe bedin lockdown usa convid naman daw yawaaa style bulok kunyari positive convid
is it just me or is there anyone else out there who thinks that two of them rarely answered the given questions like they were beating around and around the bush somehow right
bidden needs a care home
not the fan of either one anymore
the worlds leaders are truly afraid of trump because when ever he met the leaders he only spoke about making america great again and informed them that he is aware of what they owe america and he wants it back
trumps words are not lies when he says he will stop the war he willhe has proved that over and over again
biden i believe is much to old now to lead america i listen to him talk and just feel sad and sorry he may try to mean well but his time is now over i wish he would just try to live his last years in peace and carm god bless you biden for also never giving up you have shown how a man should be weather you have everything or not alot of men should take that example as even if you have nothing never give up the future president trump i believe is truley sincere as he has shown he only wants to help the world president putin is waiting for trump to be president and believe me once trump talks to him the war will end trust me
i cant believe the us elected joe biden as their president its just national embarrassment the once worlds most powerful country with the worlds weakest and most feeble man as their leader lol
i hope ptrump has right ways for america as for all over the world
biden looks very old and non responsive to trumps comments cant believe biden is still in the race harris would do very well against trump
4 americans views establish vote in california you must be
sovereignty of the people political economic and administrative authority to manage a countrys
there are many different models of government around the world that it is sometimes easier to understand the idea of democracy
i didnt have sex with a porn star welcome to adult roasting
donald trump speak exactly points
in american dream everything is possible something that can not be done from other countries is can be from american dream from american dream even the candidate who convicted of felon crime also eligible to run for the presidency and eligible to becoming the president of the united state isnt this great only happens from america dream

one is drunk and the other one is drugged end
when trump points at joe biden that was rude because pointing is rude but when joe biden do that they he he he goes start talking more and not be stuttering
that robot walk from biden
i know joe biden is old and trump is not its just still fair im not a trump fan i am not a joe biden fan joe biden is just old i know he studies hes just old he doesnt really he knows that hes president but trump is just he just want black people to do all the work im black im american and biden is not scared to talk he is a real man but hes a man too but hes just like wants to get black people away and if trump wins black people literally have to do everything he says even white people white people is like his favorite thing joe biden is white black hes sort of black so yeah
i am not a trump fan i am not a joe biden fan
trump is a liar he lied like 35 and he got 35 guilty but if he went to judge judy just judy was saying him to jail
and trump is black so he gonna have to listen to his self and not let all the black people do all the word donald trump if you see this comment please just leave black people alone
so i dont have to listen to donald trump
would never actually watch cnn but did enjoy the protrump comments here
every time trump spits some facts biden is like accusations false accusations
you need to change the joe processor it has become very old the worlds first robot president
biden is such a loser talks shit about golf then immediately turns down trumps offer like two days later to play a match for charity we all know trump wouldve won by about 30 strokes
i thought this debate is supposed to be issues base instead of talking down on each other should nigeria also copy this kind of debate from america
trump had horrible ideas biden is just fumbling
i watched the whole damn thing from start to finish biden didnt perform as bad as what the media has made it out except for that initial moment of lapse he actually made better points than trump overall
140 how he cuts him off then proceeds to hand it over from president biden to president trump is trump a president
to be fair if you skip the opening moment of lapse its actually biden who has more substance in what he says
my motherland needs help bangladesh is bleeding save bangladesh students university students are the heartbeat of bangladesh and they need us right now electritcity and interent are being cut at all over the country in bangladesh international attention needs urgent we want justice lots of mothers are losing their child
i support trump wish him to be the president again
why make it shameful
biden face was looking to cry like a baby
kamla haris was good candidate to face trumphe is so smart bro
joe is just a hateful old man he will never be more then he is right now
this isnt the same joe from 2020
i dont know trump but i pray for him i have feeling donal trump n i want him to see agian will become president n i really like him i am from indian
trump is good but rude how can you say this man he should put a little respect
trumps not wrong
as a stay at home mother to 6 small children my family for the last 4 years under bidens administration has struggled so bad financially that i have had to consider going back to work leaving my small children who need their mother with some stranger at a daycare this is something i have never wanted for my family my husband has had to take on 2 full time jobs just to put food on our table we use to be financially secure went from owning our beautiful 3 story home in a safe area to renting a 3 bedroom dump for 2200 here in indianapolis indiana in a bad area 2200 had to sale our suv because of the gas prices increasing so drastically now we have to try to accommodate my 6 children in a sedan it was all so much easier under president trump my husband and i didnt struggle to raise our children we didnt struggle to put gas in our cars or food on our table we had a beautiful home as a colombian immigrant who worked hard for years to come to this country legally i am sick and tired of seeing these illegal immigrants cross over into our country with absolute disregard to our laws im sick of the state this country is in due to joe biden and his incompetence to lead it needs to end trump2024 latinsfortrump
biden is educatedethical and has diplomacy mr trumpyou dont all we hear is semantics and rhetoric that has nothing to do with fixing your tattered economy you mr trump are an orator that sends a clear message war at all costthen you retireplay golf and laugh or smile with glee that is not presidential candidate for the struggling billions in this world as we speak you will prove nothing and amount to a rhetoric parrot youre not even a loyalist demeaning the monarchy through over exaggerated and misleadingscathing journalism you and your advisors are thugs in a tuxedo i may be right i may be wrong but the world is watching you and the preferred candidate in mr biden in our books democracy is first and foremost and you dont appear to be diplomatic mr trump
wow thank you cnn for allowing our comments american political dialogue remains the highest in worlds political system
biden is reading hes so damn fake notice when he said hes looking at a convicted felon when he said that he turned to trump he should be already looking at him he wasnt looking at him because hes reading the telepromter with his fake ass please change thisafidavit of support with the us immigration i was scammed by a filipino woman to get here in the us now i have to support her that fact she wont go back to the philippines she rather stay here so i can support her now shes able to petition herself that means she can become a us citizen even though she scammed me she changed as soon we got married ee had 90 days to get married we had to rush t get married
look at the us right now biden cant say shit hes the worst ptesidant im a vetran trump is right i cant stand his ass especialy when i pay for groceries
this is the reason why i love americas political system we only have two trains of thought to consider in a debate and we only have two options to choose whod be the next president
its a very nice debate the country is the founder of practice to democracy
trump liar stop all these rubbish desperate man you are still lying
old people should not lead the country
all joe says is the fact of the matter is without sharing one single fact
putin you are really a bad boy in usa trump supports putin biden getting pissed off
131 it kind of sounded like he said i skibidi with

its obvious he doesnt have a clue what is talking about mrbiden please leave
i dont understand biden words at all my second language
we finally beat medicare
this was hard to watch

save_bangladesh save_students please read this patiently not everyone possesses the resources or opportunities necessary to become entrepreneurs many individuals require government loans and other facilities to facilitate their ventures those with connections and access to quotas often receive these benefits more readily even if we manage to start our own businesses we often face challenges such as unofficial taxes and corruption by certain factions given these circumstances for many securing a stable job remains the most viable option furthermore over the past ten years only a minimal number of people have been able to join the bangladesh civil service through quotas are descendants of freedom fighters but over 50 of jobs belongs to quota system several others quota however many positions have been filled by individuals who could afford to buy the question papers before exams this raises the question where are the truly talented individuals unfortunately it appears there is little room for common and talented individuals from less privileged backgrounds moreover according to some renowned articles only 05 of the total population are descendants of freedom fighters how can the government label the remaining 995 as people who supported pakistan in 1971 branding them as socalled rajakars or traitors currently students across bangladesh are protesting but the government is responding with brutal violence students are being mercilessly killed by governmentsanctioned gangsters and police forces turning peaceful demonstrations into tragic bloodbaths to make matters worse the government is cutting off the internet confiscating phones and preventing journalists from entering university halls during these massive killings and acts of torture
