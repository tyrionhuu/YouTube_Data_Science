a judge has ordered ex president donald trump and his companies to pay 355 million in a ruling in the new york civil fraud case the former president is also barred from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years lol rotflmao so sweet so good just keep piling on more and more stress and anger on this clown and maybe well be rid of him before november too ex president donald trump and the trump organization must pay 354 million in fines a judge ruled friday issuing his longawaited judgment in the states civil fraud case the decision also bars them from seeking loans from financial institutions in new york for a period of three years and includes a threeyear ban on trump serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation judge arthur engoron handed down his judgment in a 92page decision on friday the ruling is one of the largest corporate sanctions in new york history the judges decision also blocks allen weisselberg the former chief financial officer of the trump organization and jeffrey mcconney former corporate controller from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years and permanently bans them from serving in the financial control function of any new york corporation the evidence is overwhelming that allen weisselberg and jeffrey mcconney cannot be entrusted with controlling the finances of any business engorons order states in addition to imposing limits on trumps business activities the order bans his two oldest sons eric trump and donald trump jr from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or legal entity for two years the two who serve as executive vice presidents at the trump organization must also pay more than 4 million apiece including interest weisselberg is ordered to pay a 1 million penalty engoron issued a scathing rebuke of trump his two adult sons weisselberg and mcconney in his decision writing that they refused to admit error even after four years of investigation and litigation their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological he wrote they are accused only of inflating asset values to make more money the documents prove this over and over again if the attorney general is permitted to retroactively insert herself into private commercial transactions between sophisticated parties no business transaction entered into in the state of new york will be beyond the attorney generals purview the spokesperson said every member of the new york business community no matter the industry should be gravely concerned with this gross overreach and brazen attempt by the attorney general to exert limitless power where no private or public harm has been established new york attorney general letitia james brought the civil suit in 2022 asked the judge to bar trump from doing business in the state and sought a penalty of 250 million a figure her office increased to 370 million by the end of the trial trump the trump organization and several executives including his two eldest sons donald jr and eric trump were named as codefendants in the suit even before fridays ruling the judge had largely affirmed james allegations that trump and others at his company inflated valuations of his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a decade and misrepresented his wealth by billions the scheme the state said was meant to trick banks and insurers into offering more favorable deal terms engoron ruled in september that trump and the other defendants were liable for fraud based on the evidence presented through pretrial filings the trial which began in october and wrapped up in january focused on other aspects of the lawsuit related to alleged falsification of business records issuing false financial statements insurance fraud and conspiracy the financial penalty james sought known as disgorgement is meant to claw back the amount trump and his company benefited from the scheme under new york law disgorgement cases are decided by a judge not a jury the lawsuit laid out seven causes of actions the claims of illegal conduct that james office said entitled the state to claw back illgotten profits and warranted severe sanctions against the defendants persistent and repeated fraud falsifying business records conspiracy to falsify business records issuing false financial statements conspiracy to falsify false financial statements insurance fraud conspiracy to commit insurance fraud the claims revolve around financial statements given by trump and his company to banks and insurers the statements were prepared by accounting firms using spreadsheets of underlying data that included vast inflations of trump property valuations the defendants lost on the first claim persistent and repeated fraud before the trial even started the sept 26 fraud ruling engoron agreed in september with james office that it was beyond dispute based on evidence presented through pretrial filings that trump and his company provided banks with financial statements that misrepresented his wealth by billions the documents here clearly contain fraudulent valuations that defendants used in business engoron wrote in the sept 26 ruling engoron found as fact in that ruling that trump and the company overstated the valuations of many properties by hundreds of millions of dollars he cited the palm beach assessor valuation of trumps maralago club at between 18 million and 28 million for each year between 2011 and 2021 the values for which he paid local property taxes during those years trump valued the property at between 328 million and 714 million on his annual statements of financial conditions ivanka trump and her brothers said they couldnt recall many of the interactions at the center of the case including deliberations related to efforts to secure financing and insurance for trump property developments eric and donald trump jr both sought to pin blame on the companys accountants claiming they had little involvement in the preparation of financial statements that misrepresented the values of company properties but engoron determined that there was sufficient evidence that eric and donald trump jr intentionally falsified business records he found that eric trump intentionally gave mcconney knowingly false and inflated valuations for the seven springs estate a trumpowned property in westchester county new york the former president took the stand on nov 6 stopping to address the media on his way into court its a very sad situation for our country he said under oath he gave longwinded answers seeming to test the judges patience at one point engoron addressed trumps lawyers saying we got another speech and urging them to control him if you can as questioning continued trump defended the valuations of various trump organization properties said the companys statements of financial condition included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies engorons order criticized trump for failing to answer many questions which the judge said damaged his credibility overall donald trump rarely responded to the questions asked and he frequently interjected long irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial his refusal to answer the questions directly or in some cases at all severely compromised his credibility ivanka trump the former presidents daughter and once an executive at the trump organization was originally named as a defendant in the suit but an appellate court later dismissed allegations against her citing the states statute of limitations,-0.5,"(None, None)","(None, None)"

dear cnn news please investigate the following concept very carefully if we interpret the actions of russian president vladimir putin as the retaliatory assassination of alexey navalny for the ruling issued by the judge against donald trump this fundamentally requires an absolutely invasive digitally and materially present instance of espionage either within the inner circle of the judge their courthouse or the trump legal team the assassination happened immediately before the ruling and public knowledge of its contents details but during its time of being typed printed and controlled dissemination this meaning a russian presence is somewhere within the 24 hours prior to these very moments of today there is a russian spy operating either digitally or physically within the united states which has to be embedded within this new york civil fraud case if the russian spy is within the inner circle of the judge or the courthouse the people who have access to computers and documents is limited thus the presence should be easily detected if anybody realizes they need to go searching for it if however the russian spy is within contact to the trump legal team then we would have undeniable proof that donald trump is in contact with vladimir putin the former united states president is an asset to the present russian president is by all obvious accounts a traitor the immediate arrest and isolation of donald john trump for treason is warranted and his candidacy for a second term as president is forfeited if this does not proceed immediately then it is a conspiracy to allow it to continue on if not for by as an intelligence operation then as a systemic corruption to deny this egregious vulnerability of western democracy because if the russian spy is operating freely within the courthouse so as to meddle about where else in association to donald trump are they operating in america there could be multiple locations and branches of governments and places of law that are technically compromised here,-0.7276,Donald Trump,AGAINST

this is the death penalty for the gump corp cuz his socalled business has always been nothing but the equivalent of a giant check kitingponzi scheme he throws a bunch of money into poorly managed projects that can never reclaim the investment so he offsets part of that by not paying the bills when they come due then he lies to insurance companies to keep that expense low while also lying to tax authorities to keep that liability fraudulently low all while then grossly inflating property values to lenders in order to get better terms and to borrow against equity that does not exist the way he kept all of the plates spinning was to keep churning more and new scams using borrowed monies from one to keep making payments on the others until he could get a new scam up and running then add in the wonders of money laundering opportunities that his projects in panama eastern europe presented to say nothing of the illegal enrichment from the middle east china while potus and the millions just rolled in just in the nick of time since he was already on the verge of going bust and being indicted just before resorting to a run for potus he just ran out of time and now when forced to work under the law with administrative compliance looking at everything it presents a way of doing business that gump has literally never experienced the simple fact is that he somehow managed to fail completely in the past even with all of his illegal advantages and ignoring of the law so the odds of him being able to do it all legally for the first time in his life are less than zero oh and lets not forget that hes gotta cough up a half a billion dollars so far just as a starting point for this brand new world to him his watching them all fail again and again while we wait for them to go to jail is the payoff for having had to tolerate these scumbags being allowed to live among us all if these years cant wait to see them all die broke exposed and alone,-0.92,Trump,AGAINST
