    "video_transcript": "thank you everyone hello that was hard-hitting journalism you saw in the owl I didn't know you were going to show photos of me from high school I have some surprises yeah it's not really fair um you can't do it for President Biden because the technology wasn't invented when he was in high school it's not really fair good evening everyone I'm Colin Joost and I'll be delivering the Republican response I'll be honest with you I don't have a lot of time uh I need to get back to New York because I'm juror number five on a big trial Trump's lawyer took one look at me and he's like he's got to be on our side thank you Kelly for that very kind introduction Mr President Dr Biden vice president Harris Doug good good good Doug as you can tell from all the comments about my wife I'm also used to being the second gentleman [Applause] and I am honored to be here hosting what is according to swing state polls the final White House correspondence dinner I hope that tonight will be a night to remember for most of us I was excited to be up here on stage with President Biden tonight mostly to see if I could figure out where Obama was pulling the strings from I have to I have to admit it's not easy following President Biden I mean it's not always easy following what he's saying like but before I begin tonight can we just acknowledge how refreshing it is to see a president of the United States at an event that doesn't begin with a bayth saying all rise and I would like to point out it's after 10 p.m. sleepy Joe is still awake while Donald Trump has spent the past week falling asleep in court every morning though Fox News said he was just being anti-woke we are all here tonight at nerd prom well Matt Gates is at regular prom but I actually thought I saw Matt Gates here tonight but it was actually just my own reflection in a spoon like many of you here tonight I pretend to do news on TV My Weekend Update co-anchor Michael Chay was going to join me here tonight but in solidarity with President Biden I decided to lose all my black support Chay told me to say that and I'm just realizing I was set up I've done weekend update for a while now but most people don't know that I started out doing the actual news my first job out of college was as a reporter for the Staten Island Advance newspaper they do not have a table here tonight but they asked me to pass along this message to the other print journalists in the room you think you're better than me by the way I want to point out when I worked at the St now in advance we had a daily circulation of a 100,000 The Washington Post would kill for that so as a former aspiring journalist I want to genuinely congratulate all the award winners here tonight congratulations the correspondence Association provides scholarships to promising young journalism students who may one day be sent off to cover dangerous geopolitical hotspots like Columbia University tonight this event is being televised live on C-Span [Applause] and if you're at home watching C-SPAN on a Saturday night I hope they find your body soon before your cats get to it there are so many incredible news organizations here tonight also a few credible ones The Washington Post is here Washington Post they were the ones taking your coats at the door please be sure to tip Fox News is here tonight it's the end of an era rert Murdoch stepped down at Fox News which is strange I didn't think there was a step down from Fox News Trump media is here Trump media uh not at a table just screaming loudly in the corner to No One Wordle is here tonight sorry sorry I meant the New York Times I forgot they do stuff in addition to puzzles I have to say it's not a great sign when the only thing keeping a print media company alive are games people play on their phones too chilling for you guys room just froze faster than Mitch McConnell and I have to say apologies to the times but as a Staten Islander I still get all my news from the New York Post thank you the only paper where the front page always has the same 200 Point font whether the headline is World War II to start tomorrow or Central Park owl dead in building Collision the New York Post is like having the New York Times summarized for you by a crackhead the times will say a border deal continues to evade Congress and the post is like these Mexicans are taking my stuff there are so many incredible individuals here tonight Laura Trump is here tonight okay I got one woo she recently released a cover of the song I won't back down upon hearing it Tom Petty died again I can't believe I'm saying this to a member of the Trump family but maybe stick to politics Senator Bernie Sanders is here because he's not the type to pass up a free hot meal and in general there are so many hardworking influential senators and Congress people here tonight and I just want to say on behalf of everyone I know stop emailing us stop it we get it democracy is on the line and your plan to save it is to flood our inboxes like your prate and Barrel that's it's also wonderful to be back in Washington I love being in Washington the last time I was in DC I left my cocaine at the White House luckily the president was able to put it to good use for a state of the [Applause] union I'm kidding of course the president doesn't call it cocaine he calls it High-Speed Rail that's good by the way can you blame the guy for turning to cocaine he must be exhausted orchestrating four separate trials against his rival rigging the Super Bowl and gearing up to steal a second election wow Biden left I love by the way that Trump's two attacks on President Biden are that he's a scile old man and a criminal mastermind I'm like I think you got to pick one personally I don't know any criminal masterminds who bike to get ice cream also it's not like Trump himself is Young and sharp I'm not saying both candidates are old but you know Jimmy Carter is out there thinking I could maybe win this [Applause] thing he's only 99 there is an election there's an election six extreme ex long months from now so let me see if I can summarize where this race stands at this moment the Republican candidate for president owes half a billion in fines for bank fraud and is currently spending his days farting himself awake during a porn star hush money trial and the race is tied the race is tied nothing makes sense anymore the candidate who was a famous New York City Playboy took abortion rights away and the guy who's trying to give you your abortion rights back is an 80-year-old Catholic how does that make sense [Applause] by the way President Biden isn't it crazy that he's only our second Catholic President and what's even crazier is that in just a few short months we'll have our third in RFK Jr I'm kidding like his vaccine card says he doesn't have a shot Everything feels strange Now by a lot of measures president Biden is having a very successful first term but people don't seem to realize it like with the economy The Vibes are bad but the numbers say it's strong the economy is kind of like you on the steps of Air Force One it feels like it's stumbling but there is somehow upward progress I do think that you can do more on the economy sir I really do for example have you considered eliminating the national debt by shorting Trump stock people keep asking if our lives are better than they were four years ago of course they are four years ago we didn't have online Sports gambling what more do you need that by the way that's probably what's keeping the economy afloat online gambling and Taylor Swift without those we'd be in a recession right now the problem is people are always going to compare your first term to Obama's but I think there are actually a lot of positive similarities you both made big strides in healthcare Obama got us out of a recession you got us out of a pandemic Obama got Bin Laden you got OJ and by the way now that OJ's Dead who is the new front runner for Trump's VP is it Diddy by the way I bet if Trump did select Diddy as his running mate I bet this race would still be tied I think even some Democrats say that they are underwhelmed but I think they're just not living in reality manage your expectations people it's like tonight sure we all wish we were at the Waldorf right now but we're at the Washington Hilton and we have to make the best of it just be happy you're not at the Airport [Music] Hilton journalists these are challenging times and we need the people in this room to help guide us through it your jobs are not easy and it doesn't help that we're living at the end of traditional media The Gatekeepers are gone did you know that 90% of people now get their news exclusively from social media and that must be true because I saw it in a random guy's Tik Tok he was recording the video while driving a Toyota Corolla but he seemed to know his stuff isn't it crazy by the way that Tik Tok could be outlawed in the US by the end of this year that's a real shame because we're going to need Tik Tok to document who is storming the capital next January 6th things are not bad for everyone though this may be the worst time in history to be a print journalist it is the best time in history to be a courtroom sketch artist my God the most famous man on Earth is on trial and there's no cameras allowed just the artists their pastels and their desire to make Trump look as bad as possible every sketch of trump looks like the Grinch had sex with The Lorax in closing I would really like to take a moment to recognize all the print journalists in this room your words speak truth to power your words bring light to the darkness and most most importantly your words train the AI programs that will soon replace you and finally I wanted to thank my family and I wanted to thank my friends for being here tonight to support me I want to thank my wife for enduring lots of jokes and for agreeing to individually meet everyone in this room right after the ceremony that [Applause] is that's really special honey thank you don't be shy come right up she hates privacy and with my with my family in mind I wanted to share one last thing with you before I go and I wanted to share one thing with you Mr President before I go I lost my grandfather this year as you alluded to a firefighter William Kelly uh he's the reason that our son's middle name is William he helped Raise Me growing up and I would not be here today without him my grandpa was a firefighter on Staten Island for 40 years to make extra money for his family he was a substitute teacher and he painted houses and since it's Staten Island I should point out it's not like the Scorsese Irishman painting houses he was not a mafia Hitman he actually painted houses the FBI is here I don't want to start a whole thing my grandfather was another rare Irishman who didn't drink because he lost his father and his brother to alcoholism and I swear Mr President this is not an age comparison you remind me of him some of your best qualities remind me of his and I will say he was 955 and he was still great at stairs I think it's because he didn't try to run up them [Applause] but the reason that I bring up my grandfather and I don't know if you know realize Mr President but Staten Island firefighters are not normally your demographic Staten Island voted about 70% for Trump in the last election and the other 30% was for Giuliani but Staten Island also sided with the British during the Revolutionary War so we're not always on the right side of History you [Applause] remember but my grandfather a Staten Island firefighter voted for you Mr President he voted for you in the last election that he ever voted in I mean I'm sure someone else will vote twice in this election using his name but that's just how the Democratic Machine Works he voted for you and the reason that he voted for you is because you're a decent man my grandpa voted for decency and decency is why we're all here tonight decency is how we're able to be here tonight decency is how we're able to make jokes about each other and one of us doesn't go to prison after we go to the Newsmax Afterparty and when you look at the levels of Freedom throughout history and even around the world today this is the exception this freedom is incredibly rare and the journalists in this room help protect that freedom and we cannot ever take that for granted so Mr President I thank you for your decency on behalf of my grandfather and I thank all of you almost all of you for your decency as well I am very honored and grateful that you invited me here tonight thank you and good night",

He was balanced in his criticism but took the truth to where it is required the most. It was quiet because most in the audience recognized the truth in satire...rather than being duped by opinion based television shows that claim to support journalism when the truth is that their lack of data driven journalism is honestly just propaganda. If you cannot clearly identify the difference then I regret to inform you that you are just not able to think objectively. Again, just an opinion but after I got a handle on his approach I absolutely heard the message. He didn't hide in fear like most he easily revealed, rather he pushed forward to complete on a message that is in my opinion heard by mostly logical and intelligent people. The rest obviously just wont get it...right over their heads. Again, Bravo to Colin Jost.",

They are based out of Democrat New York & donate to Biden's campaign.\nThe weaponized DOJ was created by weakening the DOJ for a take over. Using the Black Lives Matter BLM riots created by CBS & NBC lies about George Floyd to defund the justice system, upset their balance, & put them in a weakened state.\nCareer criminal drug addict fights hims self to death resisting arrest. \"Excited Delirium\" is where you fight until you collapse & die.\nI'm not going back to jail, was the attitude that killed Floyd. Mindless \"suicide by cop\" is what it was.\nCBS & NBC are deceitful liars, pushing a socialist/communist take over of USA by destroying USA one industry/business at a time.\nIt's communism lobbyist support that gets Biden elected & lobbyists pull his puppet strings. With out lobbyists, Biden is nothing. He will sell out any one, or every one.\nI suspect it is a Russia+Hillary alliance & the emails that were deleted probably proved it.\nAI is controlling all Biden democrat politicians as one, & controlling CBS & NBC in a \"WAG THE DOG\" type situation where TV controlled the government and a movie producer deceived the public. NBC is a Democrat movie company & produces SNL + Seth Meyers. CBS owns Cobert's LATE SHOW. Do you get it yet?\nIt is truly a mindless, government take over towards socialist communism.\nAI is more powerful than you think.\nI posted about Blacks with unmanageable curly black hair that can't be seen on TV or properly colored.\nThen AI produced a commercial showing a WHITE woman with a BLACK AFRO in a soap commercial & showed it on TV the next day,\nI posted that all black men on BadTV are with lighter skinned women & the next day, all that stopped & they started showing white men with black women in commercials for the first time. After this post, since they are found out, they confess+excuse+and go back to doing what they were doing.\nBadTV is gaining accepted social change through subliminal brain washing using selling a product as a mental diversion.\nYOU ARE BEING MANIPULATED & USED. Only low life scum do that to others. Racist AI is running the democrat biased propaganda machine CONSPIRACY between CBS+NBC+Democrats using global warming as an excuse. All the NAZI brain washing tactics are being used on you by BadTV CBS & NBC. Your tax payer money is being used against you in this way.\nYour VOTE is being manipulated against your will with out your knowledge. Notice how late shows & day time TV is all about the Democrat socialist addenda.\nCBS & NBC are movie/TV influence monopoly company's that need to be broken up like \"MA BELL\" was broken up. AND held accountable for ALL THE DAMAGE$ they did.\nWe humans contribute to global warming & can make some changes in our behavior to reduce global warming, but the SOLAR SYSTEM our planet is in goes through cycles of heat & cooling. You know of Ice ages but are not informed of the heat cycles.  What man does or does not do will not change the cycle.  The globe has been getting warmer since I was a child 70 years ago, at a steady pace.  Oil wells that vent unburnt methane is a real global warming contributor that we do nothing about.  Democrats don't care about global warming, they care about using environmental wacko's to help achieve their power take over so they can trade power for money.  The two are interchangeable you know, like money & gold, or money & guns.  Don't be an IDIOT & fall for the democrat plan of take over America, or you will never be free again.  Democrats against the \"AMERICAN DREAM\" is what you are witnessing.\nA vote for Trump is the only way to end the Democrats destruction of America.  If USA falls, the free world will fall after it.\nFreedom is what is being eliminated in the here & now.\nIf the whole world is run by one communist leader there will be no more wars, & there will be universal health care, & jobs will be guaranteed for every one & if you are an IDIOT you won't know that there will be only one happy person on this planet.  The top leader.\nFreedom for all results in many happy people, choosing their own fate & a society where selective breeding improves the lives of the living.\nCommunists kill free thinkers after enslavement. That is the \"DUMMIE DOWN\" system of reproduction.\nCommunism also kills, blacks, fags, lesbians, religious people which is all woke democrats & all religious Republicans.",

            "comment_text": "Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed guests, and anyone who accidentally wandered in thinking this was a TED Talk venue, good evening!\n\nI\u2019m Samuel Andrew Harper Jr., standing before you not just as a writer but as a chronicler of our times, a reflector of mirrors, and, quite possibly, a provocateur of thoughts in a world that often prefers to snooze through alarms.\n\nTonight, I bring you tales not just from the corridors of power, but from the more shadowy alleyways of culture, politics, and technology that our everyday narratives dare not tread. Like that time I wrote about Michael Valentine Smith guiding us through the Trump presidency in my book, \"Always Punch Up, Donald Trump!\"\u2014because, if you're going to navigate the chaos, why not do it with a Martian\u2019s wisdom?\n\nLet's talk about the power of satire and humor, which I've explored deeply, finding that it not only entertains but disarms, allowing us to confront the uncomfortable with a chuckle. And in these times, when reality often outpaces satire, we need that laughter more than ever. Yes, even if it\u2019s just to keep from crying or screaming into the void.\n\nIn the realm of copyright and creativity\u2014oh, how we dance on the tightropes strung by laws and regulations! My venture into using Charles Schultz\u2019s creations on a book cover was less about artistic rebellion and more an inquiry into the maze of intellectual property. Who knew Snoopy could be so litigious?\n\nLet's not forget the digital landscape, where I'm crafting tools on Pico XYZ, creating web apps that perhaps might one day replace me at this podium. Imagine, a digital avatar delivering punchlines coded in JavaScript and irony, tirelessly debating whether Batman or Joker has the better moral philosophy. Ah, the future is wild, isn\u2019t it?\n\nBut, while we jest, we also reflect. My work\u2014our work\u2014is about more than just filling pages or airtime. It\u2019s about challenging norms, pushing boundaries, and sometimes, about being the voice that says, \"Hey, wake up, there\u2019s a whole universe unfolding while you\u2019re binge-watching reality TV.\"\n\nAnd as I address this distinguished crowd, with the President here tonight, I'm reminded of the profound responsibility we share. Not just to inform and report, but to engage, challenge, and inspire. To ensure that the stories we tell not only recount what is, but question what could be.\n\nIn closing, let us toast not just to free speech and a free press but to the relentless pursuit of truth\u2014however quirky, uncomfortable, or bizarre it may be. Here\u2019s to more stories, more debates, and yes, more books, because as long as there are stories to tell, we have a reason to keep talking.\n\nThank you, and let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s a good night, not just here, but everywhere our words can reach.",

I don&#39;t know how the RICO case or the Jan 6 case will turn out, but the hush money case looks a bit hard for him to squirm out of, and he looks so DOA in the documents case.

But thanks to all the journalists in the room who are doing \"journalism\" while pretending there's an explosion of violent antisemitism. Actually, Jost did make that line about Columbia University, that was as close as he got to discussing the Palestine situation. Good joke, I wish he would have hit these people way harder though. These \"journalists\" are the stenographers of genocide. And they don't care how many voters Biden loses, they will keep insisting, as Jost does, that Biden is decent. No, he's not. He's a president for corporations, as almost all our presidents are.",

He did you a proper by teaching you the basic unit of respect that, sadly, young men of current times are having to learn from the POV of a beatdown. Thats what we used to pass down to our descendants in our not-so-distant violent past during the latest 250 years of history. People are being conditioned to give no respect on any level without being stroked first. That is counterintuitive in our normal society (where the word of the day used to be comity)which used to be outgoing and friendly. We have been dragged back 50 years in lost progress of our society, discarding the personal blood, sweat, and tears of those people who sacrificed for that progress like yesterday's trash . In the past 3 years alone, in spite of digging in our heels in response. And we are now faced with the avowed challenge of a presidential candidate to dismantle the whole shebang and rule over the remains with a bloody fist until he dies. And half the country is standing with this insanity? Needs to have jokes made about it, imho.",

IF this message reaches one \u261d\ufe0f person who supports Trump and changes their heart, I\u2019ll feel that my 1000\u2019s of tweets that express my feelings towards Trump were not in vain,\n   Trump and dump not only rhyme, they basically are composed of the same things, garbage,\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f \n   Trump is trash. \ud83d\udeae There\u2019s nothing about him that is honest or true. The man is about as pathetic as wet match trying to get a spark, \ud83d\udd25 It won\u2019t happen! \n   For a man who can\u2019t string two sentences together without lying ,\ud83e\udd25 he sure has a lot to say. I\u2019ve listened to this man tell lie after lie. I\u2019ve watched him blame one thing after another for his crimes. Evidently it\u2019s president Joe Biden\u2019s fault that he cheated on his wife(at home with a newborn). It\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault that he tried to pay Stormy off and cover it up as expenses on his books. \n   I wish Trump would just once,tell the truth. Just once. It would sound like this. 1)I forced myself on Stormy Daniels. I covered it up with a 130,000 hush \ud83e\udd2b payment. I told my lawyer to explain it on the books as a legal expense. I did so The People would not think me unfit to be president. \n   2) I lied \ud83e\udd25 and tried to steal the election. I caused an insurrection to take place. I tried to get fake electors counted in my favor. I lied and continued to lie about the election results. I knew that I lost. \n   3) I sexually assaulted a woman in a dressing room. I lied about that too. \n    4) I cheat on my golf scores to win. I even cheat on the players who are paid to let me win. My golf trophies are fake. \n   5) my wife hates me. She\u2019s repulsed by my farting and we haven\u2019t been intimate in since the day I cheated on her. Almost 18 years. \n   6) I lie because the truth will end my career. The only reason I want to become president is so that I can manipulate my way to becoming super wealthy. I will give favors out to people who will pay me back. Foreign and domestic. They will owe me favors. I appoint judges with the same idea \ud83d\udca1 that a favor for a favorable judgement. \n   7) I\u2019ve cheated so much that it\u2019s a habit. I lie so much that I believe what I say will become true. \n   8) a bad person knows he\u2019s a bad person. Life is short. Trumps days are limited. He knows that he has never accomplished anything good or worth remembering. When he\u2019s gone, he will be remembered for his deeds. Nothing he did was ever about helping others, only himself. This is why I do not like him. I despise him.",

If you look at the types of doctorates one can earn (PsyD, DBA,  PhD, <a href=\"http://d.sc/\">D.Sc</a> and EdD) the EdD is not only the easiest to obtain, but is also very limited in it&#39;s opportunities.  Basically, an EdD is earned by schoolteachers looking to move into administration and become principles and superintendents.  In effect; paper pushers. Which is why, among many in the academic community its knows as a &#39;fake&#39; degree even though of course it is real.  Hence my comment about her degree being in how to give out detention to high school students.  <br><br>Doctorates held by educators such as college professors are usually PhD&#39;s, not EdD&#39;s because its more research and academic based.  <br><br>Doctorates held in the medical field such as psychologists are PhD&#39;s or PsyD&#39;s.  and are MUCH harder to earn.",
