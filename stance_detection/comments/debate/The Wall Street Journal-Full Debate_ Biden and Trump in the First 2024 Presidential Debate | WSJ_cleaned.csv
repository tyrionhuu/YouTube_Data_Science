unsteady biden a subdued trump the debate analyzed httpsyoutubemewbfi9t1zssipdgghc69olmqjdd
biden is no match for mr trump trump is too smart and rightious powerful strong and humane he really cares about his people
president biden he ill be the next president of america people trump must respect the american citizen what decided time he was president
trump did nothing he broke records doing good
does sloppy joe have an ear piece in let me find out yall was helping him answer them questions and he couldnt keep up
the most heated debates are always the ones with trump present
biden is a powerful president of america people
biden hes a man he changed american people trump must step aside away from the race of presidentancy bse he was there and feld nothing this can do for american people in history trump is not
trump is a liar he feld let him to another thing not compilation
joe biden is out period period
this will probably be the oldest presidential debate in history and its an honor to be alive during this time
the ideaand by the waynumber 1number 2
rahul gandhi should debate with modi like this thats real democracy
what whyyy why did the united state even choose biden for president trump rumbling and biden mumbling
very good to listing
biden looks like that offended cat meme the whole debate
funniest thing ive seen all year
does biden know that lying is a sin or what
donald too old and senile to compete with a much younger energetic and more capable candidate
trump is like and this guy
no one gonna talk about how biden said put bleach into your arm referring to the vaccine he highly recommended to take almost forcefully people lost their lively hoods when jobs demanded it to be done
idc about no political parties i follow who i vote because i just wanna go to walmart and buy my grocery without paying an arm and a leg
i cant even make fun of biden considering how much i respected him in his prime i can only feel bad that hes declined like this he just needs to retire and spent his time with his family for once hes worked for too long
go harris go
trump lied and lied knowing biden had absolutely no mental capacity to rebut he ran over joe like a tank against a vw beetle
3 weeks later biden dropped out of the race not surprised
at this point joe biden cant even call himself a fluent english speaker
hes not in the race anymore hehe
this video is funnier than any try not to laugh video out there
trump is right all the way
after everything thats happened regarding politics this month got me binge watching past debates and rallys trump 2024
i weep at the thought that we wont see another legendary debate between these two giants
mr trump aka mr misinformation
my legs are dying just watching them for standing almost 2 hours
whos here after joe biden dropped out of the presidential race
trump lost me when he said hamas invaded isreal
i had a good job when trump was around inflation went sky high when biden was president
the idea the idea the idea the idea lol
the problem with the democrats is that they are blinded by their personal hatred for trump which is all their campaign is about rather than what is actually good for their country it is so obvious weird and strange
call it what it was pal a disaster ill debate you any time anywhere name the place pal i hear youre free on wednesdays he was a joke during his stolen election and he has always been a liar pal you guys have taken advantage of a sick man you all should be placed behind bars
if you actually listen to what biden says he actually makes it lot of sense but admittedly i am stoned i hate trump by the way
it seems like trump gets more minutes to speak than biden its also litle weird seeing to men talking about the abortion law what do they know i know they are the spokesmen but anyway this just shows that we still is living in a mens world
who is here after the kill tony episode
we had the best environmental rates ever and yet 2023 was the worst year of the climate change disasters yet trump does not care
john biden are honesly guy who gave refugee chance to came down unite staate we can say without john biden ameerica will be bad future that is what think guys
donald trump absolutely torched joe biden at the 110112 mark trump has my vote
come visit yakima washing√æion you hate it
we shouldnt expended so much money on that war
trump is sharp i love the guy joe biden cant even speak in whole sentences trump was like yeah he is right he did beat medicare to death lol
you were a fool to forgive an enemy i dont know when you will learn the age of civility is over
are we not gonna talk about how joe literally wasnt able to speak the 12 minute mark
long live trump
i really appreciate how this debate was moderated pointed questions asked to both candidates strict time limits respectful behavior from the debate facilitators i appreciated not having people yelling over and interrupting each other a wellorganized debate
the idea the idea
he really stood up for over an hour without falling over
i wont be able to retire if it keeps going on this way i cant even take a day off cause of the cost of living i havent stopped working to over 2 years cause i get behind due to the cost of food and just living i dont have insurance i have to pay out of pocket
puppet lost all the batteries and is ready to throw in the trash time to change puppet
slow biden be killing me with that the ideal comment and what we did for medicare and trump said yeah you beat it to death they like 2 old grandhogs out there battling
i have never watched a presidential debate and gotten a headache no matter how many times i exist and returned to continue watching until now mercy to both of you target on the question without personal feelings if you feel personal imputs are necessary add it at the end after addressing the question first with factual recollections
i hope the public is keeping track of poll s
biden always sounds like he needs a pint of ice cold water after watching this i really do wish dt becomes the president of the usa more so after his last term and most definitely after bidens mess of a presidency
this debate was an audition for joe biden to remain on the job and he failed
posible trump will wins soon
2020 debate was fun to watchbut this is sad
i feel sorry for biden not a well man trump is pure comedy im from the uk and he entertained me throughout covid with his anticscomedy gold
the economy is in fluxed because biden took office
whos here after this made biden drop out
trump went savage on this
poor biden he looks so out of it
trump literally rants about the same thing its exhausting to hear
the more i look at biden the more he looks like mr burns the cartoon
i feel sad for joe biden he is getting too old n couldnt speak out condidently i love him too though i love trump
poor joe wondering why hes running against alec baldwin
trump president usa viva americaviva trump
welcome to clown show
cnn communist news network
with the drug pandemic man its has a lot to do with the state of pur country all the dept murder amoung other things its a very sad thing to see and i dont blame people for looking for other ways to find relief or just plain giving up mental health is a huge part of that too we just cant give up guys im only 22 and i dont want to be the generation that watches our world fall into a state of decay
biden himself does not have confidence in his points
i get it what he said but the one trying to kill him were not a hispanic
the idea
im foreigner but somehow i believe that even americans cant understand biden
trump speaks normally biden the idea that nr 1 nr2
its strange that biden somehow can speak i thought he can only mumble all the time
trump wants legal criminals
biden is too old for this
i cant believe this is real bro
facts out way peoples lies and emotions
wow i felt so bad for biden that i couldnt finish watching the debate he needs help
fact and reality i believe this is why they wanted to wipe you sir
youre definitely right mr trump
tjis my friends i knew your voice alway with good analysis
hello help please leave russia
marilyn mosby decided let my grandson die thats what theyve done
biden dont go to victims funerals he dont care
trump is a businessman my husband is a commercial electrician with over 30 years experience and is licensed in multiple states we are financially destitute and have a hard time paying for groceries even with me growing a massive garden and putting up as much food as i can why why cant we get a loan why cant i pay my debts now what happened help save us
12423 trump lets not act like children biden you are a child i found that hilarious
mr slow joe please stop projecting your issues on our president trump
ive been blocked from all medical attention
omg i see why he dropped out what is going onnn
trump is holding up not to laugh
morals of an ally cat
joe biden forever donald trump is no more trump will never know what hes talking about but biden will always have the power
climate control idk but hey clean water
this is a presidential freestyle battle
they dont want that poisonous fake mucus forming food from us lol smh they are crazy
am i the only one who noticed that when it came to speaking on black issues is the only time so far that he didnt have enough to say and was reminded hes got more time that didnt happen on the other questions feels like priorities are leaking through doesnt care about black wages is what it seems like to me
why are there kamala commercials over every trump related video seems like google might be a little liberal
i cant watch this guy for 2 mins
i work for unemployment this is a lie there isnt any jobs
thumb will definitely win
when biden said hipuitabitta hubtaph whaphabuttapht i really felt that
age and time is against joe biden he did the right thing by dropping out of the presidential race i am watching from jamaica
trump was right
honestly joe biden sounds congested but what he is saying is good i really dont know why he was said to be so terrible in this debate
and where did they get grocery only marked up 20 bucks more like doubled
so two kids on a group project pointing fingers arguing who did what and nothing on real issueschange needing to take place grand we have a lot of brilliant people in this country why are they not running for president
after that i dont need to whatch any comedian show for at least one week
ill be honest unless youre brainwashed into believing blue is the only way i dont know how you could vote for harris at this point minorities shouldnt like her for her time working in lawsee some of her work in that position she acts very aggressive and rude which dont get me wrong trump can also be guilty of as well but its at least funny when he does it she much like hillary seemingly hates anyone that doesnt agree with her and i doubt even many women would want to see her in office as having her as the first woman president would almost guarantee we wouldnt have another one given how little confidence she has instilled in the american people as a vp i thank her for her time working as the vp of our nation and im certain that not all of her efforts have been fruitless but honestly taking away personal appearances what is there to like about her
talking about porn golf an sucker and loser in a presidential debate is crazy work
i would rather have an old but wise biden to run any country than a mad man with no manners
you could see the difference of joe bidens performance in his presidential debate in 2024 as compared to almost all of his previous debates most people are not aware about biomedical biometric hackingnanotechnology brain machine interfaces systems of internet of things weaponization of everything etc work that could affect the wellbeing of a mass or a targeted individual if you are not aware of the nature of these you are not aware of how fragile and dangerous our world is has become
joe looks like hes stuck in a constant ww1 dramatic movie scene
we all know why they added the rule to turn the mic on and off
im disappointed i really wanted to hear what they were going to say about lowering the daycare costs i have 3 kids and going to work full time me alone is not cutting it along with the high inflation rate
why do they talk like white people dont matter or blackhispanics are belittled citizens are citizens why all the race
bidens face when he brings up the fact he called black people super predators in the 90s was a look of shock like he had a flashback to when he said it and only just remembered sad this is the state of politics in the us an old man who must have more helpers than santa and a narcissist who cant accept defeat or be humble for a mistake on any level iffyou check the claims of both of the statements they make whether its the economy foreign affairs etc theyre both hyperbolic to prop themselves up and punch the other one down lying to themselves and the public
2900 biden got cooked here too bad the founding fathers arent here they would sentence biden for treason
wish harambe was on the ballot again
im not even american and while i definitely was a big fan of biden in 2020 i do particularly enjoy everyone unified over this debate performance being bad
on the right a poor old man with a enthusiastic wife behind him take a look in history at anna eleanor roosevelt
joe will drop out
i love us presidential debates even if i dont live there
trump said he really beat medicare to death
why does everyone act like this is an embarrassment on both sides trump is sharp and articulate
seriously biden said if the rich pay 25 of their earnings to the gov could get us out of debt within 5 years are you kidding me why should the rich pay for the gov messing up gtfoh
just watching this on july 22 hits different i imagine
the idea
biden saying the middle class was devastated by trumpwhat a joke food and inflation has quadrupled under biden trump gave people more money take home in their paychecks the interest rates on the housing market is out of control under biden cars no one talks about the increase of the price of cars since biden in office at first it was the aftermath of covid bc of production shortages but that was 4 years ago the price of cars is crazy how much theyve gone up everything more expensive and getting worse
if trump saves the palestinians i will support him too from now on
trumpwho endorsed me for president but i wont say that but they endorsed me for president is absolutely crazy
comprehensive spech expect
its ridiculous how far i had to scroll to find this after searching for the exact title
if biden win the election the great america will sleep biden needs to retired he is so old looks like he can even talk properly due to his old age is there any other young and energetic person to be a president candidate for both of the party huizzzzif i were an american i will surely vote for trump
biden is a war criminal who will answer for everything
presidential debates should be fact checked on the spot by a panel of 3
and now this wannabe president dropped out joe was the worst president in the history of america
i can not understand how anyone can discredit mr donald trump he is the salvation of america
everytime joe biden says the idea take a shot
biden doesnt even believe his own lies biden ruined america and is a liar as trump statesweve seen these thing come to pass and biden still says they arent true what a farce
my favourite comedy movie america
this is very tough for biden he looks very frustrating
to make someone believe first and foremost speak clearly and i dont think joe biden can do it thanks to bidens speech in the debate i have another materials for my students to practice english listening for their ielts test
and by the way
who after biden resignation
the idea that joe still think hes good fit for the job is shocking
baiden is a fearoooooooo this shows that trump is already triumphant
trump thinking am i high
thee ideaa that we found ourselves in a situation where number 1 we beat medicare number 2 youre the sucker youre the loser number one and by the way
the question was its ridiculous how often thats said
i say i dont believe woman should be in positions of high power because woman can be ridiculously emotional but boy thats all im seeing is emotions overpowering reasoning its crazy lets just keep putting eachother down with terrible insults instead of explaing in front of americians why they should be the president of america
shoot i dont like biden but at least hes somewhat answering the questions
how are you gonna help americans in the throw of addiction that cant afford it its all joes fault its all trumps fault great answer you guys
sooooo what about childcare
they need to stop attacking each other and tell us why they should be the president answer the effin questions
biden made trump look like a lot more eloquent than he actually is
biden whole time hey that guy is cool i might vote for him
ok president biden is slow in talking but at least he is acknowledging and answering all questions trump is dodging all questions and just keeps blaming biden for everything jake and dana did hold trump focused on answering questions
the face of donald trump when biden is speaking
southwark gonna have a field day
the ideal
niether one addressed the cost of child care in reality
who else is here after biden dropping out
trump doesnt even know what climate change means he didnt answer the question
its like a couple boys fighting no ones answering the actual questions
1310 prolife not prochoice we need trump back in the white house to make america great again ùóùùó≤ùòÄùòÇùòÄ ùóüùóºùòÉùó≤ùòÄ ùóßùóøùòÇùó∫ùóΩ
to all americans please vote for someone who at least has clear speech i thought youre not supposed to come to a debate drunk biden what
looks like a rap battle between eminem and mumble rappers
trump never takes responsibility for his evil actions
biden we beat medcare trump yeah he beat it to death was funny not gonna lie lol
trump doesnt even answer the questions why because hes the biggest liar
yes its true all of our benefits medication ssi housing etc are all going to illegal immigrants that joe is allowing in with open borders
2126 he said im going to continue to push until we get the full ban full initiative relative to what we can do with more border patrol and more asylum officers i dont see why people think this makes him soumd confused hes actually answering the question as asked unlike trump who uses every question as an excuse to rant off topic yeah trump sounds articulate while hes making stuff up like saying that biden opened the borders its easy to find the words when you say whatever the heck sounds good to you biden is carefully thinking of the accurate response and happened to stumble on one word in the context of a high pressure timed debate someone stumbling on a word as they quickly decide which point to make in the moment is normal ill take unembelished honesty over articulate nonsense any day
who is here because joe biden cancelled his plans for reelection
joe number onenumber twonumber threee
biden talks just like tinubu of nigeria could it be the bfactor couldnt wrap my head around what he says
so according to biden only black families struggle with child care and home buying cost
and the problem isnt biden its the dnc platform and the shadow people who are really running the country into the dirt and pulling this puppets strings
the idea
biden wasnt the right guy in 2020 hes never been the right guy it was just his turn and they didnt have anybody else so they stole it for him and installed him against americas wishes all you need to do is see his son hunter to see what jb produced into our society father of the year hed never win
joe biden is caudeling the black community for votes
lets see 900 billion dollars to ukraine from you the tax payers under biden under obama trillions to 13 wars more depth more death in history including more than ww1 ww2 combinedunder obama and record breaking inflation under biden gas food real estate electricity disaster and his clean so called economy which is worst for enviroment than gas this man just like trump said a disaster
donald trump
president trump please rescue social security and medicare
did either of them give an actual answer
why are they both anti white
1154 the first president to say skibidi
me tooo
this is why i dont vote lol
i saw it for myself president trump should have won the last election i cannot imagine how it changed overnight wheres the proof that it wasnt stolen i dont see or hear anything about that
whos continuing to watch after biden dropped
we need them to play a game of yugioh
this is what started the whole coup for the dems they didnt think he would do this debate trump 2024
when its the turn for trump and he starts grilling joe i look at joes face and he looks very disturbed i sympathize with him grilled joe is gone
i agree that this is our last chance to change things around for the better making the right choice is the most important thing we have to face right now more than ever
i love how the democrats in this comment section are trying to cope with the dementia patient of a president they voted in by acting like both did horrible during this debate and its all a joke trumps absolutely destroyed biden no contest and he just proved on july 13th how much of a leader he truly is
imagine if this kind of debate happens in india between former pm and current pm
trump is the right guy
why joe why because we know what you are we know what runs rampant in dc and throughout the media and corps
this type of debates should be in our country also but our minister is coward he is afraid of media conference then its impossible to imagine that he would debate because he dont have guts to debate its our fault who is blind
trump should be able to make right what was done to him the way he was treated i believe there are a lot of people being treated wrongly in the same similar ways this is the cause for american division we cannot allow this there is so much more that is wrong going on and i hear one person talking about solutions and the other totally stuck on trash talking i realize that this is a part of running for president but i have never seen such ridiculousness
i worried biden will collapse in the middle of debatehe look not fit to be a president and the whole world can watch it
i know about the homeless veterans i met one i know that lots of people ended up homeless because it was made possible when rent was so called not required to pay during covid there was no recovering for them and lots of people went homeless theres other things as well even now theres people dying from cancer and they are still trying to work to pay their bills and keep up their rent a year ago this person owned their home and was doing well now that they are sick they spend their life alone sad and worried about getting through wheres the help for someone in this place he has worked in his life he did his part there is no program available to help him at least not close to home in wisconsin
the debate that sunk the biden campaign
now we get kamala v trump debate yessss lets go trump
imagine a world where journalists did their job and people actually took them seriously
lets be frank bidens presidency was horrible for the us and the world
its joever
everything just went downhill after biden became a president
ill never forget how tangerine man handled covid what a joke that was
twice the cost of living twice
two tacos at jack n the box used to be 1 now its 199 inflation has doubled i wont even get on my increase in car insurance and im considered a senior at 55 and starbucks people in california are homeless because you can work at a job making 85000 a year and still cant afford rent or purchase a home
i didnt receive my tax money from joe
bruh biden speaks like a failed robot experiment
good job donald trump
4338 joe went low the lightbulb came on then lol lol
i dont have my tax money
this aged well
the biden only one word to describe his performance incompetence 101 the biden beat medicaid
the debate ended alongside bidens political career
20 million views now what biden out
canis mas machoin my judge milian voice
the beginning of the end
im in tears biden really doesnt look well they shouldve never let him go up there the man is obviously not 100 no one on his team noticed what was going on im 55 and my thoughts are fleeting often so i can just imagine what biden is going through shame on the democrats
destroying our country we all feel it
these comments are more entertaining than the greatest comedian
brandon has no idea whats going on surrounded by incompetent liars feeding him a fantasy story he isnt checking anything wont watch news gets talked to like a baby
biden god sees you and your conrads all your corrupt politicians keep lying i pray you ask for forgiveness biden youre will in trouble gods wrath
he killed biden with this debate now biden is gone and good riddance
who is here after biden dropped out
never thought i would say this about anyone in office but biden i dont even know why tf you ran in the first place go trump
you know you are screwed when trump makes more sense than biden
just fight each other already 2 old men trump will win
i think trump is fit for presidency than joe american should vote for the right person
i am watching this debate again after biden dropped out i was waiting for a second debate too bad i cant watch it any longer no more trump vs biden debate better than any reality show
ive never heard of a politician that i trust so for me i go by results under trump america had a strong economy was prosperous and not involved in wars and wokeism was nowhere near as rampant as it is now under biden america has descended into chaos some states worse than others we are seeing lawlessness the economy is crumbling because people are being even more heavily taxed to fund overseas wars cost of living has gone through the roof america has become a laughing stock and woke nonsense is rife the proof is in the pudding
joe says he lost more jobs than gained during his presidency as if covid had nothing to do with that lol
15k new jobs is not much at all
joe blieden is just its constant knock knock mutha fka
i do feel sadness for pres biden buts its time to retire with dignity people shouldnt mock him we will all grow old
this is sad like why is joe doing this to himself
thats a wrap buddy biden checkmate t r u m p 2024 make america great once again 81 million votes biden huh
everyone all around the world not just only think this biden regime is weak but all knows that biden is the weakest ever known president of america in this history of this country
trump is cunning a smart guy he turned himself a speaker of rage angst hardship helplessness lost hope lost dreams hurt and pain of the people and they buy what he says for its what they want to speak out themselves and what they want to hear as a christian it brings me to tears in what a mess your country is and how the people suffer yes he does what none of those in charge up there have done right but the crisis is not centred nor focused solely on the us its a worldwide one everywhere the exact same disgraceful story going on inflation of money crime poverty joblessness cut offs price explosions frustration leading to disbelief in policies governments etc dearest americans you are not alone in this when you isolate from all the rest of us you will get worse problems than you already have trump is absolutely right in so many points but wrong planet its not planet america i cannot tell i dislike nor disrespect him my heart christian belief restricts me from doing so and i understand you the people absolutely i am not to judge nor point fingers but it needs more than just a good flaming speech moving the masses and emotions i am not an economist but we all know that economy is connected around the globe we have a global economy tightly woven together like the gordian knot every country wants to benefit and oh boy do we have many countries on this planet ask yourselves what youll do if on the long run maga going nada who will you blaim
somehow i can only understand better what trump is speaking
when biden goes over time multiple times doesnt get told to stop or thank you besides a few bit but every time trump does and is finishing a very important exposing sentance he gets cut off
wow im a filipino but i support donald trump for great president of usa
cant take this anymore senile biden has no idea what he is talking about embarrassing
the debate that ended bidens presidency
trump was killing people in afghanistan and biden is killing people in palestine both are worse off
how can you vote for biden after this
president trump is the real one
why is it always that the new government blames its failure on the previous government
im conflicted on the one hand this is elderly abuse but on the other hand its the most powerful person on the planet
they pay 82 on taxes says biden but high yeld saving accounts they get 70 of that back
i swear thats a guy in a mask absolutely nuts
i love how biden looks shocked everytime trump answers
as a non american this thing is better than netflix hilarious i am so sorry that these are your only options to vote for
honestly i feel bad for boden he needs to retire hes tired and lost let him out on his slippers and watch his show
biden is just incoherently rambling this is ridiculous
if only my grandfather couldt see this strange times to be alieve people60 bilion is zelenskys monthly bill
he wasted a lot of money of us tax payers for those wars under his administration
to biden is everything is lie
im here after joe dropped out the race
anybody here after biden withdrawal from the race
go trump trump for president in 2024 058
after all this it allllll led up to joe biden saying bye bye
we truly witnessed joe biden political career go downhill in real time81 million votes to dropping out wow
the comments delight
im a lifelong democrat and im a veteran i think trump will take care of us veterans as far as our military pensions and service connected pay goes im a democrat who will be voting for trump
theyre like two very naughty boys explaining themselves to their parents while the cat licks up the milk thats been split way past bidens bedtime
as a nonus american guys if you need a place to crash let me know we have plenty of space here in europe and you could see where your taxpayers money went over the past few years supporting this war its like watching history
joe biden says idea so much i dont think that he has any idea anymore
a humble request to the international community to save the common students of bangladesh from dictator murderer hasina murderous dictator hasina is shooting common people like birds to maintain her power please save the people of bangladesh
now the 18hole golf tournament against joe biden will never take place it would have been better than any debate on planet earth
whos here after hearing that biden dropped out of the election
the day this debate happened seems like everything changed day after day breaking news crazy events unfolding
biden immediately starts blaming trump as if the last 4 years didnt happen the left has trained him well
10531 and by the way

the island of maraj√≥ ilha de maraj√≥ in brasil there are familys with children so poor with no money to pay birth certificates to register their children so please ask for the police to secretly investigate that they are raped and trafficed
who is here again after bidens departure
this debate ended bidens political career
so sad this is the last trump biden debate i was looking forward to seeing biden degrade further in 2 and 3 in hindsight trump should have gone easy on him to keep biden in the race i dont think itll matter though
joe blinks once in ten minutes
america needs a strong president biden cant even put his sentence together if you elect this guy he might die in office of old agebiden simply mumbles america needs trump the world needs trump he deserve a second chance
joe got crushed so hard here that hes dropping out
who is here after he stepped down from being president
trump did say he likes guys who dont get caught in war not pow s reference to john mccain trump said in 2016 while running for president said it on a talk show
whos watching after he dropped out

10529 11321 11524 they keep cutting him off
1152 1204 he went off the grid started freestyling
they are watching u all
question for trump if you dont think about cancer or what was in our shots products and so on then how are u going to help humanity if u dont care
trump the real boss
stop making everything racist its the fault of the people who are unemployed single mothers etc take responsibility of your own actions if these people cannot afford these children then dont have them and expect the taxpayers to raise your children
under biden everything but my salary doubled
2 incompetence absent minded to be voted as president of americano matter whoever wins america is gameovermy lovely one china is stronger than everemperor xi the emperor of my communist china will always prevail
this election is diagousting the biggest counry the most brave and dream contry for so many is today a joke tuled by greedy sick old men terrible just terrible
order peace low prices culture no immigrants freedom of choice electric or petrol cars freedom and respect back to normal life
2225 brandon just speak to em he called him brandon
this is just pure entertainment biden looks terrible though but these guys just continuesly go back to to previous arguments instead of answering the questions that are being asked
trump you have open the eyes of the world
its not really biden vs trump its really biden vs biden biden cant even keep his thoughts and words straight lol
honestly cannot believe biden got elected i voted at my local voted center im a black republican had my ticket number and my vote was lost in transit because i live in a swing state i highly believe voter fraud occured and trump did win the 2020 election and thats why january 6th even happened in the first place
in brazil the presidential debate was same like that bolsonaro trump and lulajoe biden trump 2024
biden only defense was the idea we are are not doing anything for insert topic is a lie and he doesnt know what hes talking about
i dont know how anyone can watch this and continue to support joe or rather whoever is running this country
joe biden literally started mass incarceration with the 94 crime bill
wouldnt it be right if similar debates were held between the nominated candidates for the post of prime minister during the election campaigns in india too
stay for president president joe biden for president of united state of america
hope trump is president again i like him
family need to take biden home poor dear needs a carer and its so obvious his developing dementia plus his at risk of falls and unsteady on his feet
biden sounds like he is terminally ill
the man god has chosen for the amiricans for now has spoken the whole world can now reflect and resolve that donald trumpis the right man now for the amiricans his speech is divine and direct to solving the amiricans problems what a humble honest hopeful and happy speach from donald trump i a m calling on the amiricans and the world to surport donald trumpfor the good of american people and the world to vote donald trump in nigeria we are praying for trump victory come november this year donald trumpis the next amirican president come november this year
its true that the other countries are seeing america as the best joke with biden as president humiliating
if trump gets back in office in 4 years will be right back where we started in a recession
trump is talking about barack obamas economy you cant take credit for the economy before youre sworn into office
in what policies did trump talk about none old trump does is stand up there and lie
republicans like to make fun of joe bidens debate but look at ronald reagan he had alzheimers for 2 years into the presidency
before you people vote you had better read project 2025 this is the republican agenda a fascist look into the future vote democrat or there will be no more elections
1259 what this man has done is absolutely criminal
no wonder after ruto visiting america he went bk to raise taxes mr trump xax for the enlightenment
this folks is the debate joe wanted asked for and killed his hopes of becoming potus47 all hail your next president donald j trump
all of a sudden i thought my english listening skills became better as a foreigner
biden should retire long time ago seeing him debate not in his perfect condition
biden is lying through his teeth and trump is not actually answering most of the questions what a predicament we are in
as an outsider looking in biden spoke well for the most partwhat is wrong with people in the usa
why wasnt you have the morals of the alley cat not on the highlights
im not american and have no horse in the race but if any person thinks biden is fit to be president you need to seek psychiatric help
non bias and biden took the dub comments rigged ez reads
having watched _the debate_ for the first time i dont know what all the fuss is about trump gave loads of exaggerations while biden gave statistics biden spoke like someone with so much more to say providing the detail of what he had done the benefits of it and highlighting the international cooperation of which the usa has been the lead since 1945 while trump just blamed domestic problems on immigrants coming across the border from prisons and mental institutions and presumed current international crises could easily be resolved by the respect the world has for him but europe mocked trump privately as evidenced by the leak of diplomatic cables reports while russia china and nkorea merely massaged his ego with meetings while taking advantage of his worldly ignorance to continue their objectives hey ho
yea hes a 6 handicap thats the biggest lie of them all how can anyone hate this man trump 2024
cnn should be shutdown hopefully that wil be his first thing as president
full debate biden and trump in the first 2024 presidential debate wsj
trumpwere a great nationamerica is trusted and respectedblabla also trumpwere a failing nation because of this guy
503 so were working to bring down the price of around the kitchen table and thats what were going to get done
okay but can someone please get biden some water like mush mouth here is strugglin haaaard
trump i wish he was a great president because i wouldnt be here right now the only reason im here is because hes so bad me biden
i cant believe how politicians can lie with impunity no remorse whatsoever
can anyone translate
god bless america
im struggling to pay for groceries man bring trump back
wait a min joe was in office when pandemic started and dailed down
biden is so old that he speaks in hieroglyphics
biden can only talk good going against trump not for our president
rewatching this affter the assassination attempt i notice this time around trump is sharp he has laser focus and is not shying away from serving up the truth however it comes out its a passionate tone a patriotic attitude towards injustice to our nation trump 2024 all the way
618 great job by not spreading germs he almost covered his whole face wow amazing
all of that money spent on other countries while we are struggling in the usa trump is a business man he got the job done his strong brave he will make america great again he will send us more money to the american people either by check or when we file taxes i cant wait trump is not a popet like biden so called dr jill his running this ship thats why we are sinking
biden is too old to rule again pls retire trumph is good for the job
one thing i strongly admire from dt is his confidence amazing just watching him walking in with such high confidence makes me feel confident that he will demolish crook biden with just one hand maga
mr biden your sponsoring a war in ukraine
lets be honest price gouging is the problem not the economy yall oh its inflation ummm no there is no data to support this
at times trump was almost gracious to joe he felt compassion for his sad situation joe bidens family and close circle should be ashamed for parading him around and abusing him like this america is crippled with this bogus administration in charge do you know they havent had a full cabinet meeting since october 2023 his inner circle was trying to shield bidens cabinet to attempt to hide his condition down with the dirty elite politicians rise up america
gonna say this america stop voting for aged men theres a reason why the age for presidency is 36
id really love to see epic rap battles of history do a trump vs biden my inability to understand a word sleepy joe says would go right along with my inability to understand rap
biden cant even talk take him out of office also fire director of secret service
hes giving 200 billion dollars on ukraine no wonder everythings expensive
remember when biden visited a veteran who lost his arm and instead of thanking the soldier he said what do you want or when he told a construction worker i work for myself vote trump
the idea
im just wondering what people outside of america think of this
americans trump vs biden rest of the world were so doomed
who is that old man on the right lost grumpa
im confused i had no idea what biden said not trying to be mean but why does he talk like that
im a kiwi living in new zealand go go go donald trump for 2024 biden backs abortion how dare he call himself a catholic im praying that trump wins
before the covid my house is only 35000 now is 13
his son registered in the army when he was already 35 and already sick so what type of a job did he do as a soldier
the illegal immigrant isnt taking your job joe one gave you your job
and by the way the idea that and the other thing is
trump is begging for money from his followers yet he cant pay his own bills trump will lose theres no way americans will elect this guy
biden just need retirement usa is too huge for him to handle
this female presenter sounds a bit racist with all those stats about black folks shame on her
millions of people millions and we only got 2 senior citizen nominees
if trump doesnt win im going back to mexico
biden ended pipeline jobs the first day wheres the solar panels joe we want the billions of dolars back from the semiconductor plant wheres the semiconductors paul pelosi may have that money since he invested in it secretly or how bout the money from the immigrant hotels nevermind just kidding if the media says it believe it
if i hear one more time an answer starting with the idea idk what ill do
biden if you dont think we have the greatest economy step down and sit down bidens only priority is illegal immigrants
i wish biden wore a voice changer box or darth vader mask when he talked like nails on a chalkboard listening to him
number 1 number 2 what a liar
watching instead of a thriller on netflix do not regret it
dear mr josef biden mr putin says in his interview that mr putin prefers josef biden as the president of usa but russia is not meddling the us elections what we had with mr hodorkovsky i remind you that usa supported a billioner mr hodorkovsky who was a citizen of russia usa wanted him to become a president of russia what we have now usa supported mr navalny who insulted mr putin saying that mr putin is a robber and murderer usa blamed a death of mr navalny on mr putin what we have now an attempt to assassinate mr robert fico of slovakia and later an attempt to assassinate mr trump why mr biden is so afraid of opposition and who is really a murderer nevertheless personally i respect for you as a father who despite all mass media shows about your son hunter remains proud of your son hunter you are excellent father but my former boss boris brought up his excellent daughter who will never be maria magdalena and what we have now zelensky has become maria magdalena navalny became maria magdalena who is the next to become maria magdalena
any candidates who dodged a question did so by use of posponments did so to get something ready for later then grinned but did so really expressivly then decided and did return to what he wanted to be focused on hearing himself say that hey wanted if they did all of that without any visible help on all or most questions both lose the debate but we all lose out on honesty from both on this televised event and tax payors will help them do their stuff too
its incredible that biden is only 3 years older than trump
i love these comments
the only existenital threat to humanity is climate change has biden lost the plot completely it is clearly nuclear arms and war sheesh wasting all this money on high cost low benefit climate policies it is unintelligent
trump yeah he was right he finally beat medicare he beat it to death am not american but i follow up most of the activities of her government and i can say for sure bidens administration is let me hold my peace
tapper is a sell out shameful
covid i skibidi with joe biden 2024
the look that bidens giving trump is completely revealing the truth will set you free never in my life have i been subjected to this type of immature ramblings which are regrettably coming from an actual presidential debate
trumps way of saying things is way better than bidens hes incredibly charismatic but biden is saying way better things im dutch and i dont know what im talking about republicans please dont get angry
i cannot believe that biden is even considered for another 4 years
take a shot every time biden says in a sentence number 1 number 2
i like the confidence of trump and his free face
us is such a laughing stock
stop bidens madness hes not a president he is a liar
everyone seems to be overblowing how much biden messed up he definitely stumbled over words but he only messed up his thoughts twice in the first 20 mins the rest of his dialouge was easy to follow
what kind of leadership now a days world producing
why do we have ads for 3 mins then give a president 60 seconds to discuss big issues pathetic
trump is the men for this job
try leaving a comment w anything in it being even remotely critical about biden and absolutely dont be vulgar or rude be polite but stick to your point and just try exercising our alleged freedom of speech by expressing your valid criticization in the comments section here post it then go back try and editting or look for it through another accoint let me know if u get the same error message saying the comment not found or whatever even though its still visible to me and appears to je visible to others it wont be
obama was the one to seperate families and putting them in cages not trump
donald j trump started the building of the border wall so that he could also influence building border walls around the entire united states thats his intention where does trump think those who are desperate to enter the us are going to go if the border wall was completed entering the us will heighten from florida trumps mindset is to plan by destructive dictatorship to rule our nation and not by american governorship
biden boasting about killing babies crazy
as someone from scotland makes me curious what is the main difference for working class people under each of these 2
biden looks weird when he not speaking but then he speaks and it really gets werid
biden says all this but had 4 years and did absolutely nothing he stated in fact he did the complete opposite and everything he says are straight lies basically what biden says think the opposite
brandon go speak to them who missed that
biden is repteloid or whatever civilization is in his avatar his eyes are robotic weirdly shining out of the contour of the eyes the way he closes his eyes speaks in the stream definitely whatever theyre streaming to him no wonder popular numerologist said biden performs mission of evel on earth
biden becomes president price of groceries goes up californians this was trumps doing
thank you trump make america great again
i got these out of the garbage at the hospital
2227 did trump said brandon speak to them
first twenty or so minutes was them arguing in the middle one was speaking cap while the other was sleeping and during the end one of them was subdued and the other was unstable what a debate
not a single thing biden says makes sense much of his utterances literally are not even words i wouldnt elect or trust this guy to be my janitor yet somehow apparently millions of people elected him to rub the biggest and most powerful country on earth this proves to me that yeah bidens got some huge problems deficiency etc absolutely however people in general especially americans clearly have an actually much bigger problem than biden and we are the biggest problem threat to ourselves wake up snap out of it cuz they have no problem snapping it 4 u
biden is reptiloid or whatever civilization is in his avatar his eyes are robotic sparkling weirdly the way he closes his eyes and speaks in the stream whatever theyre streaming to him scary no wonder popular numerologist said he is fulfilling his mission of evil on earth
who won
i dont like joe biden talks about joe biden got √ßovid test positive unbelievable situation fell in the stairs plane shock his head ridiculous joe biden fight democrats to kalama harris
80 year olds leading the world humans are funny why not elon musk as a canditate
the loudest one in the room is always the weakest
democrats creates wars trump is a business man you cant have trade if youre at war
trump is a bad man he will depot arabs and not let muslims enter america again if he wins america should embrace islam and make afghanistan their permanent allie then disassociate themselves with britain and isreal
you know biden is a bad president when you can barely understand what he is saying i vote trump
what a joke biden is if only there was a audience they would be erupting in cheer like nobody has ever seen before at trumps statements
2227 did he call him brandon
what is wrong with bidens face is it too much botox his face seems frozen
im chinese from china mainland im cant watch biden to be the president again when hes talking i feel he could past out in any minute poor man let him live in happiness
if anyone thinks either one of these guys should be presidentyoure delusional
the moderators are not fact checking either candidate
lawd how many times will biden say the idea
001 so chaps who we voting for
did anyone notice that trump called biden brandon no one is talking about that gold
take a shot for every time biden says the idea
we love trump who iswith me
man these southpark episodes just write themselves dont they
putin has great values a history to uphold he believes in his country
lets turn this comment section into a meme box
because the democraps attacked president trump for the entire 4 years
biden strengthen our medicare
cnntheres no audience tonight biden they used me as ai i wasnt there
biden doesnt even look physically fit to run for office
at least we know biden can count to 3
elderly abuse
how are these 2 your options
biden we are not for late stage abortions two seconds later after being told roe vs wade does allow that biden for 51 years all schoolers said that was the right thing to do everyone says he had dementia which he does but he also has many faces
biden is off and tired let him sleep
the idea
god bless president trump
people my age cannot afford their homes anymore we are having to move into our vehicles with our pets i know i am one
a shipment of baby food was delivered to the white house biden is now being spoon fed
why is joe looking at trump like that
left the comments open new subscriber
cnn left the comment section open me scrolling down the comments citizens of america are you aware of whats at stake these are your presidential candidates you chose them you give flat comments about facial expressions what the heck this feels like childs play it says a lot about you as citizens america has lost its dignity
before everyone blamed trump but this man stand his ground knows what he is talking and yes i had way more respect for usa when he was ruling sure he may have done some mistakes but he is a much better ruler than joe who only mumble whatnots gets questioned about what ice cream flavour he got and creepily smell kids
can biden stop reading
nobody biden the ideeuh
did someone notice that biden speak fast and the beginning because at some time the medicaments will loose the effect and he will drop down
i guess we now know who wsj is supporting
this is giving me anxiety watching this for the us including there not answering the questions we are asking
we need president trumps more than ever trump 2024 god bless america and god bless every single person reading this comment peace and love for the entire world in the name of jesus christ
any american in the house kindly confirm to be whether americans seek cheap jobs oversees
who oped the comment section
biden was saying something that meant nothing
idk ab yall but this looks like a conversation between a 50 year old man and a 5 year old kid
trump i dont understand what he said in the last sentence i dont think he understand it either burst out laughing hahahahaha
as a canadian might i ask where was the talk on what is going to be added or changed if they are elected it seems like all they did was just go back and forth accusing them of failing and being the worst
work on america
neither one says ecomomy
at the end of this debate trump won the 2020 election
joe biden pushed for covid behind the scenes to win this fraud election
evert body is discussing biden but trumps debate performance is masterful
biden always like to greet air audience
from all the bright people in the usa cant you have someone younger in charge i mean just look at them
sorry trump i go on biden
10826 biden is just taking a quick nap he will be once again coherent in just a moment maybe
theyre both as bad as each other trump lies through his teeth and speaks confidently biden speaks truth but cant get a solid word out and sounds like hes on deaths door
america and biden seems to forget that back when trump won he declared he would not be taking the salary to be president because hes already rich and that he didnt feel right having taxpayers pay his salary so he did not get paid for his presidency and the fact he said he wants clean water i can get behind that i just wish for once a president would talk about how they will help our wildlife and our animals of the countryworld tougher laws tougher penalties for animal abuse over breeding etc etc and for invading in wildlife spaces
the idea the idea the idea the idea i know almost nothing about united states politics because im from argentina and my english vocabulary is not extensive but i found the repetition of the starting phrase the idea kind of annoying so to speak can someone give a dictionary to biden please so he can start his phrases with something else rather than saying the idea for the tenth time also i dont understand what biden finds funny about anything in a countrys adminsitration he keeps laughing everytime trump says something about him he laughs why is he laughing are politics funny
american politics is so weird whats with the fkn battle music when they walked in
biden is such a corrupt liar
trump is trying so hard not to crack up laughing his facial expressions when biden stumbles on his words is sending me
is biden even talking or just breathing heavily had to turn on cc to know what he said
the idea is the fact of the matter is thats a lie first of all
trump not answering questions improvising basically a joke considering hes running for a president biden is old nothing to say about that
we await the 2nd presidential debate will the united states of america be better with joe biden in another 4 year term what will the nations solutions be the presidential election is close and fair we want democracy and we want justice
the idea the idea the idea
i went straight to the comments before the debate did anyone else
so will trump be debating someone new now lol
i feel really bad for american to have joe biden as a president what a clown
this is such a joke
unbelievable that more than half of america voted for sleepy joe bieden over donald j trump
cant believe wsj left the comments unlocked on this one
donald trump a president then hes going to try to come back into the run trump will be president next year next time
biden is misinformed 12737 this is another reason why i think he shows signs of dementia its no way he can possibly think it trump will be easy to beat coming electionits just the opposite biden seem to be in orbit and were on earth biden seem to be struggling to stay focus no way he can think after this debate hell win even before the debate he was loosing now he has lost
the difference between 2020 biden and 2024 biden shocking that is a massive decline
i seen a old lady in the grocery store she said the prices are so high since biden became president and opened up the border she only getting 2300 in snap food allowance and when trump was president she was getting 29300 she also said she has a special diet being a diabeticit cost more to eat and cant afford to buy a new fan even it broke my heart i went and got her 2fans biden is a liar and made it harder for blacks and latinos too who is definitely voting for trump2024 i dare you biden taking away from our elderly and giving undocumented illegal migrants and allows the undocumented illegal migrants to live better even than our american elderliesand being proud of it word get around guess what biden your not our choice the most of us blacks and latinos are voting for trump 2024
trump has no real answers to any of the very real problems all he does is deflect and blame ugh bidens right hes a whiner
i alteady have made my comment trumps win
biden was talking nonsense trump will be the next president
did biden just got a facelift
my 5 year old is sitting watching this with me we are irish an shes absolutely obsessed with trump ya just have to love him
i cant believe how and why americans vote biden coz he cant even walk properly wake up americans for ur own country at least this vote trump in near future choose someone in 60 year not late 70 or in 80 years
biden keeps saying the word lie he is the biggest liar ever he mumbles i need english subs for him i need a popcorn right now 10 tax credit for black people as a first time home buyer did i heared it right

donald trump is like irl whitebeard

i tought biden was about to collapse
lol trumps face
trump said btw boarder patrol endoursed me lol biden mumbled
the way he looks at biden lol
i donot know what is the real situations but looking at the confidence and the fearlessness of trump and humble answers by biden who is rather shocked i have a feeling that trump is lying i really think trump left the situation of the administration in a disaster an biden overcome the losses and is still fighting the good fighting
baam i love trump
and da winner is pres trump
i like how biden just lies lol like we didnt live through the trump presidency it was a great economy
wow this debate is like one of those comedy podcasts by adam ray feat jonathan kite

trump is right the world dont look at american the same usa is the last country i will ever move to
what the smack is biden smoking

biden jnifuniurhfimfiomrtijfr9vumfj irtvuj9rvkovmvjjromifrofmviorkc thats all he said during the entire debate
biden retirement for u already old man trump for president hes the best man for the job
the idea with flabbergasted facial expression
presidential debate or 2 karens trashtalking each other
10332 46 about to yawn
how did we go from obama vs romney to this
i cant get past the fact it looks like biden is just reading very sloppily off a teleprompter
trump be ready for all the smoke biden
who all is a foreigner here
trump on point biden looks lost i wish him great health in no way shape or form is he in a condition to run a country he can bearly talk n im not trying to be funny its sad cuz other countries r laughing at us we need a real leader trump2024
listening to biden is like listening to the paint vibrating in that machine at home depot
i wonder how many days it took him to remember the hoover line lol
the stuttering from biden is awesome
trump is awesome
now barack obama left the group
no notes biden looking down every 2 seconds hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
its clear as day who still has more professionalism class and a brain in his head even though hes very old and sluggish now trump makes a broad statement says its a fact and idiots agree
i actually cant believe the us is an actual country
ttump may have won this debate but trump wont win this election cnn is now on trumps payroll rnc
this reminds me of the movie grumpy old men
shh shh shh no demons to speak no more me like that not
trump is so energetic trump is going to have the victori in 2024 we want a candidate who protect aur country
i was doing good with medicaid and medicare until biden came in i ended up now having to pay for my medicare like i said before i bought a home when i was working when i became disabled my my house payment was still 780 my disability is 865 and they started taking 175 out of my check for medicare part b so do i keep my house or my medical insurance through medicarehmmm let me think
immigration is a problem there is a spot which is what used to be cps building is now housing hundreds of new immigrants every 2 weeks they getting sent all over the country and in the day time there on the streets infront of the stores restaurant asking for money ans clothes its sad what biden is doing to this country and its true what trump is saying there all getting socials with benefits ridiculous
uhno offense but white families are suffering also
omg this level of arguments are just embarrassing
speaking of social security my house payment is 780 and i only get 865 on disability and was denied my widows benefits because i didnt become disabled until 7 months past the statute of limitations for receiving widows benefits i fought for 6 12 yrs before that just to get my disability that is the short story
when i heard 1000 trillianares
ive got to say this i feel like a lot of gen z got swayed away from trump bc of the social issues and propaganda i myself was a lot more left than i am now but i say i am more independent but now i am able to see yes i believe in equal rights but not at the cost of our economy and civilization and a lot of the social issues on the lefts go to the extremes like no one is going to take gay marriage away and i dont believe they are like taking away surgeries and duch from trans people but the far left wants to let children get gender reassignment surgeries and allow for people to get abortions full term while trump saying the states get to vote on it which is thf people getting to vote and get there say on it he also conpletely opened the border while people can just come into the country by completely thr immigration process and having a background check thats my example of them going to the extremes we can all live together in peace together but biden prase on these issues and it at one point got an emotional reaction out of people but more people are starting to understand that he is even too far left for the leftists im not far left or far right but trump is not taking rights away he obviously gave the choice to the people which has always been biden has failed this country he is in his little pampered bubble and doesnt see how it is my family can barely afford groceries at some points but cant get on social security or food stamps while illegal immigrants can more of my friends and family are either liw income or lower middle class and we are struggling really bad and can barely afford to eat i am young and not sure if im still able to register to vote bc i turn 18 three days before the election but if youre in the your in the younger generation like me and are feeling unsure or stuck in the middle please listen to the points i just made trump can all around fix our economy please vote if not trump then robert kennedy jr who wouldve be my first choice his points are really good he talks about real issues in health care economy mental health ect im scared that ww3 is going to come quickly if biden gets relected and my brothers cousins and bf are going to be drafted maybe even myself since there is talk about women being drafted as well im not the most effective communicator but i hope i got my point accross to even one person
even with the first question im at 5 minutes and 37 seconds it really does appear that there was a bias where joe biden may have been given the questions because his answers sound a lot more prepared and scripted
i dont understand this biden guy who is he
they both bypassed the child care issue
2222 hes lookin around like yyyall hear this
this is what i imagine when bitlife gives you the be downright nasty to him option in a campaign
i also have a sagittarius moon sign like trump the moon sign controls your feelings so i know how he feels
haha theres no friendship here and its not cool with me they are the leaders of the world and cant get along hello guys joey donny we gotta get along first we cant do anything without squashing this beef
donald trump is the realest of all presidents thats why they trying to take him out he fixed everything they dont want it fixed they want us to struggle and make all us stay living check to check
bidens face when trump talks is like a teenage boy when his dad catches him in the act
man i cant believe we allowed this
is this an snl skit
joe biden flabbergasted but still supporting his speeches with statistics trump very emotional speeches with some real life examples to bring people closer to him
2757 you cut money for veterans but okay
2541 she was killed by someone who was released twicegood lord man
i am canadian and i believe in a trump usa
2302 there is lol also you only get mad when you lie
he is not a nice man
we dont want trump
nah its more like everyone has acknowledged at this point that this is pure entertainment
the largest onesided beat down in presidential debate history my god this was a steamrolling the likes no one has ever seen and like that biden was thrown out of office
biden the idea lie biden the idea lie biden the idea lie biden ah well anyways
joe is gonna look wild in 4 years i hope he can still have a conversation with someone
how are they allowed to run being in their 80s holy moly
im so tired of the charlottesville stuff trump was talking about both people that wanted statues torn down and people who didnt when he said fine people on both sides he continued and said and im not talking about white supremacists and neo nazis i condemn them totally but the media including cnn didnt want to air that part and spun it into something else to make more people hate trump you can look up the full clip
the world is laughing at america the laugh is literally trending thesedays what a shame of so called developed country usa
after watching this video trump once again will get my vote maga2024
no wonder they tried to off him
cnn is brutal in trying to bias toward biden
biden is struggling a lot to make those sentences poor guy
at 2930 when trump pointed out that biden left our weapons in the hands of terrorists when we pulled out of afghanistan that really slapped
cnn is super biased in these questions
was biden reading from a teleprompter
president biden looks as if he isnt even there
my father retired with 60 these two guys are fighting for a job with 78 and 81 big respect
when trump was president this economy was great he was a great president
im filipina but i like former prisedent of america trump hes smart watching from kuwait
my sincere condolences to all americans that get to vote this year
commander in chief needs a pt test
the fact cnn only holds these is wild
i know theres an age minimum 35 but there has to be a limit to how old you can be frfr or a mental test to see if someone is fit to run for president there has to be something more also this was a dont vote for him instead of a vote for me debate like ladies your both pretty just move along and answer the questions no one cares about whos better at golf or who has or hasnt had sx with a star thankyou
you trump aopen the border last year leadership thousand terror attacks in america
donald trump dont touch the president nevermind you have business you paid inprison
trum cant speak right now
this is insanely embarassing for joebama
at least trump didnt freeze and stare like joe
stay ahead of the game with an exclusive interview featuring binances ceo on future developments
bring it in india
bidens mental health is declining and trump got impeached not officially
for people in 2070 whats up watching the debate of two presidents i see
everyone in the army makes fun biden and dislikes him and im speaking from experience we all believe biden is a joke
the finest country in the worldwhat a jokethe world is laughing at america
biden becomes undertaker from wwe when trump said they are highly respected much more so than him
whats wrong with joes face
i can only clearly understand about the ideaaa mr president
2134 biden is me in math class when i thought id understood something but my teacher continues talking
2125 biden just cant process what to say
strong loyal presidents of the homeland no longer exist most of todays leaders led by president joe biden are concerned with winning the white house even if the price is very high and at the expense of the values and principles approved by the founding fathers unfortunately america has reached the top of the curve and is accelerating towards collapse the main reason is the current leaders sacrifice of authentic american principles and values they are desperate to appease homosexuals and this is a violation of normal human nature as an arab muslim i do not want the united states to collapse moral failure and doing what the people of lot did would anger god although america stands with the oppressors it remains an important and pivotal country that contributes to achieving the global struggle and achieving relative stability for the world god said were it not for allahs repelling people some by means of others the earth would have gone to ruin but allah is gracious towards humanity and god almighty said were it not for allahs repelling people some by means of others monasteries churches synagogues and mosques where allahs name is commemorated much would have been demolished allah supports those who stand up for him allah is strong honorable
i love that trump has respect for biden and is concerned about his health
joes got someone talking in his ear i can tell the way his talking his trying focus and listen at same time
any one else notice the voice in the background
equity is the death of meritocracy joe
trump win next election
biden was severely straining just trying to hear and comprehend everything that trump was saying
why they so old
ive watched this 3 times and it gets better every time i see biden trying it o speak and the look on his face as trump is dropping straight facts is priceless his jaw drops as if this is the first time hes heard any of this
in 1988 biden failed at run for president plagiarism stealing from other great leaders speeches same words well hes still doing it today albeit with the help of teleprompters hes known for telling lies pulling the wool over of the american peoples eyes now joe your exposed for what you always have been
we filipinos support trump
did anyone tell biden he doesnt have to read out load the periods or pauses on his teleprompter
pure comedy total entertainment thanks for organizing and uploading here
the idea number 1 number 2 by the way you are lying the biden argument
how did you guys end up with these two no back up plan
trump should just say nothing the more biden speaks the worse he looks
this inflation is killing us white families too and me elder and on fixed income that is inadequate to this inflated cost of living the whole freakin country is suffering
as a foreigner go trump save america fight and dont you ever give up
love how trump said biden doesnt want it to be this way but he just doesnt know ive never felt like biden had a grasp on any real issues even back when he was vp all he spouted was nonsense and buzz phrases i can actually follow and understand what trump says
love how trump said biden didnt want it to be this way but he just doesnt know ive never felt like biden had a grasp on any real issues even back when he was vp all he spouted was nonsense and buzz phrases i can actually follow and understand what trump says
biden face through out the debate looks shocked
trump makes a point biden the idea thats a lie thats wrong
biden throughtout whole time
just the where am i again im scared look on bidens face is just pathetic
bro was flabbergasted throughout
120 more like 200 man this man lives under a rock
can joe run tho
looks trump is winning the race all the best sir regards all india trump fans club
i kinda feel bad that alot of people kinda bully an old men instead of having some respect yall voted for him or at least most of yall so chill but yea trump 2024 100
yeah he got a lot of other leaders laughing at joe
ex pres trump can you have at least a smile face or something that will show you or is that a real you
they both hate each other but they both love israel
yeah the war man buden
trump should not shake his hand no more ever
im not with trump or biden but the internet is over dramatizing bidens inability to speak he is actually saying points in this although trump still won this debate in my opinion i kind of feel bad for biden
save_our_bangladesh save_our_students stepdownhasina stopdownhasinastepdownhasina bdpolicebrutality bdrabbrutality savebangladeshistudents
god bless usa
the idea
my left ear just aged like biden did the last 4 years
why does biden look so scared
i really love your videos bro you helped my friend grind every game all to you thanks bro i love you so much man
how anyone can vote biden means they just dont care about this country unbelievable that this is who democrats think should run the country
i felt sad for biden should he rest in his house dont make his self tired
i came back just to watch 2134
dear world please help bangladesh here political party army police opposition party all are corrupted here please help us savebangladesh
as a european i havent laughed this much in ages this should be a standup comendy show we need a netflix version of these debates id watch
we are losing more jobs now because of your open border policy no hablo free hotels food and debit cards one does that include a translator biden will take credit for anything and he is proud of it
why is biden moving like a sloth the whole time
2126 biden i think the medication expired
trump was ready to rumble biden was ready to mumble
when he said endorsed a plan i put forward twice i thought my wifi glitched for a second
including me in a time where division and heightened rhetoric are commonplace its essential for each of us to lead by example i acknowledge that i have been part of the problem but i am committed to being part of the solution its time for change and that starts with all of us no matter what political side youre on we all need to tune down our rhetoric including me this statement captures the essence of taking personal responsibility and encouraging others to do the same for the betterment of our country feel free to spread this message if you feel the same
take a look back at the 2020 debate biden is slightly wobbly but a lot lot better than he was in 2024 in 2020 trump at least tried to discuss policy but was just as belligerent as in 2024
always opens my eyes when they ask biden his opinions on current inflation with economy and he is like things are much better and better smh listen im sorry we are suffering badly financially its not the same period
go president trump you got this god be with you and united states
us veterans are worse off actually thanks biden
ive been flicking back and forth between this debate and the first presidential debate of the 2020 election biden is a shadow of his former self
heres the deal
i work intermodal under trump and biden presidency i can tell you for a fact american was great under trump the rail road was moving product across the country the international business was booming the economy was beautiful americans could live comfortably as soon as biden went to office i struggled to live working for the rail road and the product i used to move cut in half i struggle to live for 4 year working intermodal because of biden fjb
biden walks out points to the spot reminds himself of where hes going to
im suposed to vote for these 2 i dont have any other options this country cant be divided by 2 people thats not possible us citizens are either all for one or all for the other why do we only have 2 options where im from we have like 10 and they all come close in the results not 49 biden 47 trump and 3 for the other 8 candidates
the debate starts at 243
donald duck is the biggest con man ever lol anything negative about him he just dismissed it as fake news
ughhhh i dunno man this was a mess on both sides i get what everyone is memeing about biden clearly is showing his age if you compare this to him in 2008 the difference is shocking but trump also couldnt stay on topic to save his life i mean i swear rather than answering his questions over half the time he was pointing a metaphorical finger a biden i just want to see questions actually answered and not some finger pointing clown show this is an embarrassing display from what is supposed to be the 2 best candidates to lead the free world ive lived under both of their presidency and as far as im concerned things have gotten nothing but more difficult for me and the people who live around me over the last 8 years
as far as medical insurance goes biden is full of it my 20 deductible for my meds is more than my ssi check all together so now im living in borrowed time
there will be no audience biden folks how are ye

trump hitting biden with cold hearted truth
lol every time the camera pans on bidens shocked look
i want to know where your buying your groceries at at just 20 dollars more
the only truth that both of them said hes a liar
tbh idk what to believe anymore man its like they are given scripts and choose to disagree on purpose
keep producing this kind of content
can we get a running fact check cause biden is just straight up telling bs
joe the joke
how is this debate on this network when they have been proven to non stop lying
joe the idea biden
i cannot look at the expressions trump is making withouy losing it i dont know how anyone kept a straight face
why do i have the impression that biden is reading a text
im from russia after watching this debate i want to say one thing you dont need either theres no younger one because im worried that if you choose trump hell turn into a vegetable in 3 years like biden its actually very sad and hard to watch
we have a thousand trillionaires in america
i think they put biden on adderal for once
the idea
we got 1000 trillionares in america sir i dont think theres even 1 in the world
biden is only says psst psstt psttt
in the first 10 minutes biden gave trump the stink eye and lost the debate biden doesnt have a clue whats going on i feel sorry for him not
best comic show of 2024
harry kane has finally found a person he can communicate with properly
biden literally say
he said im the only president this century this decade that hasnt had any troops dying in the world thats a lie and hes been the only president this decade
2934 biden have the chick fill a sauce face
everybody and their mamacan see biden is not physically fit or mentally fit to be anybodys doggone president im voting for trump and im a black democrat from washington dc trump in da house
whose here after the assassination attempt
he is just old age maybe its about time to retired and looks like he did his best for the country and goodluck to both of us
the idea
biden is out for me hes too old and his mind is out ill vote for donald trump my main concern is the economy biden has made us pay a lot of money in groceries restaurants and everything else the pandemic is not an excuse i will like a better life than what were living now cannot even eat out because the prices are so high and forget about buying any thing else ill vote for trump percent biden is so bad and i dont want kamela harris to be a president pay
how could anyone vote for biden let alone living the last 4yrs and especially after watching this just insane trump24
chat are we cooked
im so glad im not hereyikes
b i d e n d e m o c r a c y p e a c e
this is america lol
biden is not able to rule the country
calling this a presidential debate is like saying 2 girls 1 cup is not gross
636 hes the only president on the hervahaheoovers
he had a pen and paper and kept looking down did he have notes honest question i thought no notes were allowed
highlight subscribers followers this is spleufic
the democratic party drove this ship into a iceberg trump all the way
they both are old for this job i will still support president biden
1152 what
joe homie i like you but youre 90 years late to the party

the only liar here is trump
fjb go to an old folks home buddy
trump just says the same thing over and over and over and over and over over and over and over and over and again
extremely boring and infantile debate
both suck but trumps better
i got a pay raise before covid to stay with my job it was only 350 raise per hour but everything in the store went up 2 5 dollars per item so basically the hard work i put in to get a raise is completely gone i honestly havent struggled with bills ever up until the past few years i thought covid was over for the most part why are we paying these insane prices multiple years later and its only getting worse every time i go to the store the same item that was 469 is now 529 just a month later and it keeps creeping up every 1 3 months im not paying 7 for a bag of doritos anymore i like them but come on
trump 2024 may god bless america
i love stand up comedy
2226 did i hear what i think i heard did trump really call him that
2543 the vetrapatdapattat
using bidens own words words he used in every comment the idea that he could be reelected is frightening
trump cooked
how biden be a prisedent im try to imagination all people vote to him to be that one
2134 biden really tried his best to not cry
its funny how he compares himself to fdr and says hes done more than any other president in a while people loved fdr he lead his country through the greatest war in history he got the us out of the great depression the ego on biden is tremendous not to mention no one questioned fdr cognitive abilities and he he had the support of his party
2132 thats why you came for
the look on bidens face got me
biden speaks like winston cherchil
the part where sleepy joe is mumbling his words and trump responds with i really dont know what he said at the end of that sentence and i dont think he knows what he said either about killed me
trump spitting facts biden its a lie
okay after watching 80 of the debate i have to be honest biden isnt the same like the last debate its like hes a different man i know hes grown older but my god that man cant be able to lead america may the best man for the americans win though
bro the look on biden face 1650
why does biden always look so lost and confused when he not talking
how did biden convince the great americans to be the 46th the fella is just whispering is he unwell
where is kennedy
biden really is a good person tiktok and such platforms have brainwashed yall to think trump is good
well i dont keep up with politics much but i know one fact thats true me and my family were a whole lot better off in the 4 years trump was president than these last four years its a shame covid happened toward the end of trumps time bc it seems like everything covid caused theyre trying to use as an excuse for everything going bad like its bc of trump and not covid idk all the facts but i know my situation and that of everyone i know was better off before biden
social media has trump washed these ppl
trump would spend more time talking sit abt biden then him answering the question
trump once said hitler had good ideas this man is crazy
this debate is based on social media ppl make biden look bad when he actually says some truthful things
why usas elections interest me even more than my own countrys ones
two old granny fighting for coconut one got milk out and one went to doctor
we finally beat medicare
it is jover
you can see even the news anchor were having a hard time keeping a straight face
you must apologize to trump biden you are the liar who doesnt blink is this the new ai rollout i cannot not blink with biden it was unbelievable try to not blink
trump responds to bidens more than he answers the questions put to him
trump is crisp and clear but he talks only about himself biden is like a sleepwalker or a robot when he is talking about important things as if he is talking about someone else and is not convincing is this the worlds leading us presidential election debate i have nothing but disillusionment
where tf am i bidens thoughts
okay but that is the issue we have to worry about our country for example your family is falling apart but you step out to help another family falling apart which we had no involvement in saddest part our generation is fixing it when its not our responsibility we didnt sign up for this therefore its not fair for us we cant even afford a living without having 3 jobs and 10x more stress so yes were going stand up for our rights too

2415 bro sitting there like o
trump is unable to follow the debate rule why is that
it was just hilarious
if theres no studio audience who in the world is biden waving to when he says hi folks how are you when he walks in
damm biden just roasted trump thats what i just watch
are we seriously arguing golf handicaps on a presidential debate
2132 is what you came here for
not guilty in the name of jesus amen god bless you trump
thanks trump for everything god bless you my friend in the name of jesus amen
2 weeks late here for the comments
lies counter lies counted by 1215 minute mark lies as in factual error biden 7 trump 0
biden is older and trump is crazy to think we need him
trump is for jesus amen to god bless you my friend
thanks trump in the name of jesus amen to god the winner
thank you trump the winner in the name of jesus amen
trump you will be the winner god bless you in the name of jesus amen
biden doesnt blinkthats creepy
you are right trump god bless you my friend in the name of jesus
biden needs to retire sounds like hes whispering the whole time groceries have doubled even tripled inflation is so high businesses are shutting down ppl are loosing jobs lft right plus u cant even afford to live as is u gotta work 3 jobs to make ends meet gas is up taxes are up lets make everything electric health insurance is ridiculous i can go on on but joe been sleeping way to long us americans r not stupid well i cant vow for all but some are blind
god bless you trump in the name of jesus amen you will winne
i want to see the golf match golf match golf match
trump got this
biden seriously listed trumps 2trillion tax cut as a _negative_ for america couldnt even imagine how embarrassing it must feel to wake up knowing you voted for that guy
funniest bit is when they ask trump a question and he goes straight for biden the whole minute bro forgot about the question
trump seems more woke and seems to know exactly what hes talking about but biden just seems like a puppet
trumps like a broken record you already know what hes gonna say we had the greatest everything when i was president there were no problems whatsoever except for china mexico afghanistan but we were so strong
are those 2 pensionados the best us have to offer
get it right a basket of groceries that costed 100 costs 200 now gas was 2 a gallon and now its 5 a gallon
none of them make sense this country everyone is an immigrant the real americans who should run for the presidency are red indians its time to give them back their country
grandpa biden cant even talk well all jokes aside he really needs to retire now
so this technically is a blame game huh
sorry i cant watch this again
donald trump the best president weeh no jokes on the point
bidens cabinet has been lying to him
all of america has just these 2 candidates wow probably a small country and not many people in it
fjb makes me sick
i see fear in bidens eyes whenever trump speaks
i think trumps stomach made a squelching noise at 11625
biden is so dumb he doesnt even notice that belarus is allies with russia
what blows my mind is that the press had the authority to tell the most powerful people in the world when to talkshut up wow now you know who owns the world we live in
god please let trump win we need a change people need god
this is a joke
bleach
think of barack obama when he died what he said about america ann martin ruper a king
just remembered that song trump that says well make america great again
hey you now that this prin should that he show you his name is damen
watching this debate remind me of tom and jerry
president biden uhhhh i skibidi with
dot you mean trump starts lying
guts and gaits
2134 game set match
next up the cia blessed nasa with a why cant touch grass up hours newsflash honeycup who made notchow tea gnaw sugar sugar wanna be the only one baicu
biden is talking like he reads the explenations really specifically for example nr 1 blah blah blah nr2 bla bla bla nr3 bla bla period period period blah
is there someone who actually plans to vote for biden again
jesus why is this isnt an every year show the most fun and entertaining piece of elders talk i ever seen
it is so funny that trump thinks hes your messiah and putin would have not invaded ukrainewhat planet does he live on
jesus christ is king repent and accept jesus christ as youre lord and savior and follow him deny your flesh and flee from the desires of this world for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life john 316 nkjv
watching this from germany i feel sorry for you americans to have the choice between these two but its good slapstick
people who always mention that they have a lot of friends dont have a single true one and they know it
that was for four biden
that was for
2249 that stutter got me rolling
president trump doesnt reply the exact question he just run out of bush
despite trump is a xenophobe but nevertheless during his reign there was peace all around in the world
10222 the only thing trump was wrong about was the climate i remember it snowing overnight and melting by afternoon from being so warm
it is undeniable in every corner of the internet the overwhelming support for trump 97 very few of you biden supporters i read through every single one of the thousands of comments and there are very very few of you
anyone else see joe biden eyes shifting and moving or im tweaking
this trump guy might make a good president
trumb is my manwitty lovable funny guy who can lift americaits a last chance
both horrible i feel bad theres no other choice for the presidential good luck us
i laughed so hard when the anchor said there will be no audience and yet biden waived to a non existent crowd
joe biden the whole time when trump was speaking
now biden needs to get away from the soft debate he had last time he totally blew have a no holds barred debate and see where they go
they both are here human but biden tried and now we need more strength and the economy has to go up something has to start going right its not easy to run a whole country i feel everyone had a chance
whats the age of retirement again
biden migrant crimethat was literally so true
some youtubers say americans are in touch with aliens after watching biden today i believe it he speaks alien language
whos fact checking all these claims or is it okay to just throw around these claims to look good
perhapsbiden should take √† complete resti can no more hear clearly what he is sayingh√© looks very xhausted being the √∫s prespoor america hving that weak pres
they call it migrant crime i call it biden migrant crime this cracked me up
as an european im literally shocked seeing this debate was a quite weird experience you can clearly tell which of these men is talking honestly and which one has tried to memorise the text he was supposed to say what a distopian world we live in today
this is something else that is such a comedy but at the same time a horror movie because how can they choose out of 300 mil people ppl like that for free world leaders
trump is hilarious trump 2024
its so funny i feel like this is not a debate i guess a comedy
notice bidens face looks like a mask to be honest
the drugs is from mexican cartel in mexico thats why many illegal imigrants cross the border of us because many drug lords in mexico they extort their mexican people
is biden suffering from amnesia
you 1st said as president that you were from ohio
this could be straight out of south park
i genuinely believe this video has given someone a stroke by just watching it
biden just saying anything he can think of
this 13 hrs is a waste of time and air space clearly they have no plan for the increase of day care because they couldnt answer the question theyre children
lol and then he comes in and now were all laughed at like a bunch of stupid people lol it is true america is a laughing stock
my message to trump is you are the best us president ever and you are winning again more love all the way from zambia
i wish this debate was julius malema vs cyril ramaphosa in rsa
10404 lol bidens reaction
donald trump is for better than jo biden for the development of the people of usa
stand up comedy these days
why are they not answering the questions theyre just arguing this is shameful
whos lying here
i feel bad for biden poor guy can barely put a sentence together i wonder if he still has any readingwriting comprehension skills left just that thought alone should ensure that trump is just logically elected peacefully and patriotically
what is their policy on the aging population and retirement age
u both need to step aside for real talent
no one respect usa u started it trump
two derelicts seriously is that all 350m population has to offer my god
id have biden in any state over trump
did anyone ask biden if he even wanted to be president because im feeling like he doesnt want to be and factually shouldnt be let the old man rest he seems tired and i mean that with a warm heart look at the dude he isnt doing well and can barely stand and speak idk whos idea it was to let him try n be our next president again but im assuming those ppl who do havent seen biden speak at all how can he run an entire country insane to me we were so much better off when trump was in office the proof is in the numbers
the i don think he knows what he said either comment will go down w reagans age joke and obamas line about bayonets as the best presidential debate comments since the advent of televised debates
why is trump center all his points on border control alonehere in europe they have no physical border make more concrete points everything shouldnt be about border alone i think biden should step aside for more energetic younger person to contest with trump american is gradually playing politics like africa biden just mentioned something that struck me his son served in the military in iraq can trump tell us what his children have done to serve america not about taking tax payers alone and turn around to abuse them because youre in charge of the highest office american people would decide who they want as their president
man im freaking crying we love you president donald trump god bless you man jesus christ protect donald trump please protect him we need president donald trump in the white house please we love president donald trump hes the best president we ever had amen
the united states is weak under biden
yes he may have had a large national debt but covid broke out during trumps administration trump2024
trump is not the only one who thinks our country was great again under his administration
we have the most successful economy in the world thats a lie
the idea that biden claims trump is the worst president is pure comedy
many people assume the democratic party champions civil rights but history tells a different story since its inception in 1829 the democratic party has a troubling legacy of opposing major civil rights advancements it defended slavery instigated the civil war and resisted reconstruction efforts the party founded the ku klux klan enforced segregation and obstructed civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s conversely the republican party emerged in 1854 as an antislavery movement its founding mission aimed to halt slaverys expansion and eventually abolish it this stance faced setbacks notably the 1857 dred scott v sandford case where democraticappointed justices ruled against citizenship for slaves abraham lincoln the first republican president led the nation through the civil war and emancipated the slaves following lincolns assassination by a democrat andrew johnsona democratopposed lincolns plans for integrating freed slaves into society democrats continued to resist constitutional amendments abolishing slavery and granting citizenship and voting rights to blacks amendments passed with overwhelming republican support during reconstruction republicans secured rights for freed slaves electing numerous black representatives to congress however democratic resurgence after reconstruction reintroduced racial oppression through laws like black codes poll taxes and literacy tests enforced through terror tactics by groups like the ku klux klan even president woodrow wilson a democrat supported segregation and promoted racist propaganda decades later significant democratic opposition stalled the civil rights act of 1964 while republicans overwhelmingly supported it overcoming democratic filibusters despite historical injustices democrats shifted strategy seeking black voter allegiance through government assistance programs yet these policies have often perpetuated dependency and harmed black communities weakening families limiting educational opportunities and undermining public safety in assessing the parties roles in advancing racial equality and civil rights understanding this complex history is crucial it challenges the narrative of democratic leadership in civil rights revealing a legacy marked by resistance and failed policies that have impacted black americans profoundlycarol swain
how many times did biden say the idea
i really wish he answered about the immigrant question
cnn is a joke totally favored sleepy joe
everyone in america right now is either extremely concerned for our country or theyre arguing with each other like little kids
i hate trump but biden mate you are not helping yourself
all aways love and im in uk

the open mouth staring around by biden really seals the case
he doesnt wanna lose his power i get that but bros spitting bullshxt
trump for president or were fvcked people really need to think their votes through
as for the debate its pretty clear that trump walked all over biden like a carpet he just wasnt there and not credible at all
they keep interrupting trump when hes literally the only one who had some sense to say smh
10920 illegal aliens what does joey know that we dont

i am from pakistan and its very true that biden fails to gey acknowledge as a world leader however we love trump he is a great leader and usa would get back in shape under his leadership may allah protect trump

bidens stare looks as if he is being possessed lights on and nobody is home or maybe lights off because he wouldnt be able to find the switch
im with the beautiful orange guy

i think the reasonbidens never heard so much malarkey in his life is because he doesnt listen and he doesnt see reality he is so narcissistic he believes if he says it then so it is its ignorant and dangerous
why are kids collecting ss under age of 18

pensioners debate how boring
i feel bad for the presenters

when biden was listening it seems to me that hes listening to a foreign language he doesnt speak lol
fight fight
man i watched this entire video trump i was better biden liar theyve no vision they think theyre talking about important issues but theyre not waste of my time
1920 biden contradicts himself on abortion really does sound he would terminat a 9 month old pregnancy
am out here liking every comment and am zimbabwean
one love one
yes trump is right
reminds me of the early roman republic rivalry between optimates vs populares optimates faction sulla and cicero defending the roman republic populares demanding reforms and other privileges decline of the roman republic led to rise of roman empire
i wonder if biden was given straight 10 mins to speak on what he want probably he will swallow himself
thanks yes you are right biden was beating himself
whos won the first round of debate
air pistols soundings are correct here therefore we must say it isa possibilitystiid55
bunch of big
thank you bush for libritor iraq
it seems like politics is coming to an end
they do enything for siting on achear and they forget whean he dai what gone tell to allah god
anyone else notice trump not being able to directly answer a question instead feels his time is better spent arguing bidens previous points
the idea is that biden has no idea what he said
i urge all of you to stay strong especially after what happened today you have to try harder than that to take out trump
biden looks more lost than lucy in 50 first dates
they trust us americans not you joe biden
biden cant even stay on topic complete 1 coherent sentence my cheeks are literally flushed by secondhand embarrassment
what south park character do you think is going to play joes bit im thinking jimmy butters mr poo
i think biden is more lenient and have the right to continue his presidency coz he help the needies countries than trump is full of vengrance and he is a money face
yup am reading comments laughing out loud typing and watching at the same timedidnt know am soo gifted to serve four masters at the same time until i watched this debate yet am unemployed and planning to apply for visa to the states
the cringe is overwhelming
its like watching the movie called grumpy old men im wheezing
im confused is trump allowing abortion or not
it cost 2000 for one visit of a sh therapist
i hopetrump wins he sounds like he can fix this
i like donald trump is a good president people are trying to knock him down but he is a good president we wouldnt be where we are now if it wasnt for the president trump if he was president things will be better vote for donald trump
mickey mouse joe is the lier that ever walk the face of earth
keeps saying what i was left you had 4 years i hate this man with a passion
13818 minutes of trump speaking facts
religion all the same
blue wins
what neonazis have inherited from original nazism —è –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω—É –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º
12612 these are wars that will never end should be one of trumps slogans because god damm i even felt bad for biden when he said that
whoever is voting for biden clearly doesnt no whats going on and even without noing all that can u not see he isnt fit to do the job hes clearly not with it some say not well i say not human
well that just makes sence no wunder there trying to get him in even willing to assanate trump to get him in bet its alot to do with the abortions making them give birth first seen as they need babys sikos
10433 hopefully trump will get us in the reiko accords because we need a drastic change
it is better for trump not to show himself in open spaces since he is against the war and since biden knows no boundaries otherwise kennedy already somehow wanted to nationalize the us federal system also went against powerful elites and kennedy was killed by a sniper shot it is always necessary to look at who benefits and not the official versions of the corrupt us special services like a madman shot
10433 hopefully trump will get us in the reiko accords because we need a drastic change
next time u have to say the audacity you gotta give them the biden look
every time biden looks at trump he sees him for the very first time
cant wait for zombie vs zombie part ii
this is most embaressing debate ever they both look so fake
biden were done talking about the debate its time to put trump in the bullseye he did it
stop talking about other countries lets fix our country usa this country needs help too usa usa usa
cheap healthcare and forced child support adding to a broken structure
our economy is better than a majority the inflation the biden administration did is whats killing us
trump almost died today think about that
is this mans carer in the audience what time does he have to go back to the retirement home cause i think hes ready for his nap
this is our best and brightest
from the heavens the people at the bottom america your grace has fallen and your glory no more
these guys are both complete jokes
12354 why did they start arguing about golf
at least trump has got power in hos voice when he talks biden is the example of what getting old seems like and they only 3 yrs apart biden voice is draggy slow soft and weak like his aura lets be real
does anyone think the second debate will be any different if biden does start in the race there will not be a 2nd debate
biden nailed the closing statement
this is the ever best election thing in earth finally we can laugh with joy thank president biden and deeply loverbly president donald trump
our choices have come down to a man who absolutely should not be president and a man who absolutely cannot be a president
a home is made of parents and children the behavior of a child such as expressions gestures tone of voice and way of thinking is influenced by repeated experience that an individual would adapt if there is comfort if there is hardship the individual will learn to oppose the reason for hardship becuase an individual would not want others to feel the same way it is a childs natural behavior to not share an experience that hurts because fear existed first than any other feeling before a baby cry fear from spanking is the first before a child feels happines fear of losing a childs parents goes first before an adult feels anger hes been literate enough to see conflicts in a global level happiness only child who grew up with their parents feels it do you remember getting lost not knowing where your parents went when all along they were holding you with their hands inside a mall isnt it total happiness to know they didnt lose you and you didnt get to be picked by a stranger
i hope amerikan people find president like kennedy young full power and energy you need it today i dont know trump but remember what happen in capitol ugh
id vote for trump but hes dodging too many questions
are these really live it doesnt say it is live it has a duration of 1 hour 38 minutes and eighteen seconds earlier too i only feel it is life when im high with meth these guys wouldnt know me anyway who am i for them to know me i even dont remember their gestures it is not live its what the playscreen says it was live before i saw it i love meth it makes everything true for me ahehe true true true true true
i am from finland and have to say biden isnt ok is he ill sometimes i think he is out what is wrong
no that 100 basket of groceries is now 320
trump is clueless
thank you for your service mr president now its time to leave the office with some modicum of dignity and also giving your party some type of a chance in the election
you could believe they r coming from parallele worlds where things are the opposite
1411 biden has seen the other side
stupid garbage by both parties the idea that the us is a 3rd world country or that the us is uniformly disrespected is just as preposterous the us despite the junk from both parties and their stiffling burocracies continues to expand its enormously capable infrastructure and its monetary value that makes deficits irrelevant the most relevant issues relate to extent to which government monopolizes scarce resources especially labor and hinders creativity by failing to reduce and consolidate outmoded unnecessary laws and regulations while failing to put far more emphasis on protecting us from domestic white collar and financial system crime and deeply rooted highly dangerous actual and latent cyberattacks by hostile countries esp russia nkorea and china
triple hearts
the seating arrangement was strict he else knows how compliant am i trumpy boy
this is cruel why is his family not stopping this circus plus they both making americans look total nobs you get what you vote forin uk nob is insult not door handle
why do we have regular seats in balay silangan when we eat did you put some sort of bacteria in my food who ordered it then
biden increased inflation in america too much trump should win the elections
i cant believe we only have these two as our only choice so depressing
its amazing how biden can deny about the border problem
i still dont understand how a country like the us most of the time elect people too old to run a country like theirs i mean there are great potential candidates young and energetic to run such a great country the good thing is next election will have new candidates for americans to choose from
thats right blame it all on the immigrants talk to any political scientist trumps just like any other populist making america great clean water and air to solve climate change saying that biden is just about a criminal at least he wants to tax the rich and address the issues with actions not banter i think america could do with smarter leaders and biden is getting on in years but he seems to know how grave the situation is while trumps all about charm
notice the hand signals to biden from the moderator
and by the way
1203 we finally beat medicare
biden really believes people like him their whole establishment stinks
first trump takes credit for initiating the pull out from afghanistan then blames biden for inciting war because oft he pullout biden isnt fit far from it but its scary to have the peach from james and the giant peach in the most powerful post in the world
that is somethingi love in american drmocracy
and yet we are a superpower go figure to all the people that say this country is the greatest in the world i suggest opening your eyes a little wider
you are right mrpresident trump we are sinking fast under bidendid so much better with trump in charge he is the real man for the job
a cart that cost 100 the now cost 140
shouldve just had jill up there so it could be a real debate amongst presidents
i just won two club championships not even senior
joe is so out of touch he doesnt understand he has the lowest rating of any president and the entire world is laughing at us both these old men need to retire immediately
trump i dont know what biden said i so confuse too im very confused smh
trump i dont know what biden said i so confuse too
remember this there is a low occult campaign to start and discredit a honest stuttering president by emotional and not on substance triggers their plan as internal foreign plotters wont work against young and good hearted positive people
bother their response to drug addiction is equivalent to blame the gun not the person
this was a bad night but joe biden is far more capable and id much rather have him in office than a convicted criminal
looks like neither of them are a good fit for president of the us neither of them have a concrete idea of doing something better other than just blaming each other waste of time
the debate
2227 brandon just speak to them
im on disability and i dont have insurance
im an australian i really shouldnt be weighing in on this but im worried real worried about what this election means for the world especially the allies of the us i think were fd either way pray for the world
roe v wade is the most important issue and biden is prowomens rights vote biden
1000 biden got all the questions pre hand
as an aussie this is gold haha trump v what ever that mumbling thing next to him is
honestly all the inflation talk when trump was president as a single mom i could afford to provide for me and my daughter but now im thankful to have a partner to help me because when biden came into office i lost my home my vehicle and many days my daughter was the only one to eat my job didnt change i worked 16s multiple times a week to try and keep a roof over my families head
most of the time biden stood with his mouth slightly open it was noticeable that he was trying to understand the essence of what was happening and these efforts were extremely difficult for him only a blind person would not see that an old sick person needs to retire
when history is written trump will go down as the best president of this century and possibly the best president ever since general george and t is right that the world hates biden and loves trump and the more the propaganda empire villianozes trump the more everyone loves him because we all know how stupid everything targeted against trump the only ones who thinks its legit in the cnn zombies no one that thinks for themselves thinks anything but that trump is a true patriot and might very well end up saving our country from being taken over by communist criminals masked as democratic socialism even president reagan said if communists rears its ugly head and sneaks in it will be under the guise of democratic socialism and through the democrats and dnc trump worked harder than nearly anyone before him every time biden starts with his turn he says everything he said are lies not true blah blah biden is a criminal that steals from taxpayers and he thinks he can say who a patriot is definitely not him or his lackey friends

lets go brandon
nato has become a transnational corporation disadvantages of globalization that is trying to dictate its will to the united states and europe supranational level to recruit their presidents perhaps promising them something or maybe covertly threatening them after all nato is geographically located in brussels europe and not in the united states
biden was just lucky to win the election 2021 while the us people mistakenly thought that trump was not coping with the coronavirus the us people thought that biden would do better in 2021 and did not even imagine what kind of mess they would get into with this biden biden has worsened the country in all directions inflation the southern border life has become expensive and unsafe further more biden does not care about the people at all when they tell him about it he smiles and when asked what you say why people are unhappy he answers i do not blame them for being unhappy how high is bidens ego a lot of narcissism
why is biden trying to brainwash everyone allegedly russia is trying to restore the ussr this is nonsense the reason for russias actions is that the united states sponsored a coup in ukraine in 2014 and then they began to exterminate the civilian population of donbass to bring nato troops into ukraine pulling them up to the borders of russia and this after russia left the gdr in 1994 it was russia that ruled a country like the ussr believing natos promises and bidens son participated in bioweapon laboratories created by the united states and ukraine on the territory of ukraine russia is just ensuring its security at one time the united states helped destroy the ussr and among other things split ukraine from russia russia does not interfere with europe in any way ukraine is not a member of the european union but europe is very concerned about russophobic sentiments because of economic envy to the point that europe has the audacity to supply weapons to ukraine it is clear to everyone what kind of organization nato is and by whom it is run if russia wanted to there would have been no europe for a long time but russia does not do this because it understands that it is necessary to ensure peace and prevent a big war only to protect its borders and russian people and to stop the lawless power in ukraine that came through a coup in 2014
biden is trying to explain with open flattery and words the united states is a great country that his presidency is very good that is in fact he is not praising the country but praising himself
bidden need stay at home and play with his kid he is too young to be president
alright watching biden saying weprofudodp prusic forece aah is a bit weird greetings from russia
biden talks such nonsense about taxes and always says number 1 number 2 as if some psychologist taught him that he should always bring at least 2 counterarguments even if they are sucked out of his finger and complete nonsense
i heard biden say that he had cut spending on black children how he can say such a thing on a public tv well as for drugs what trump says under biden has increased of course and biden apparently takes them and zelensky and for the the armed forces of ukraine are needed because they come from somewhere its clear from where so its clear that biden is to blame for this
joe biden worst president in usa history is what hell be known for
1152 bruh theres no absolute way
he just had a cold and a bad night
trump is so bad mouthed the indirect shade they sound like old married couple in counseling or going through divorce
when biden speaks im just reminded of 3rd grade school plays where i just said my lines so i can go back home drink my strawberry milk no passion behind it just saying what they wanted me to get out no pushing to get more words out no emotion it just feels like these questions were rehearsed for biden to respond to they cut him off before he can get any more incoherent or redundant in his ramblings i really hope even if trump loses they just let him out enjoy his last days in his own world i really feel bad for the guy theyre squeezing all they can out of him like rolling toothpaste
i dont know if biden is under influence of drugs or
is biden even alive during this this is like watching weekend at bidens
the idea the idea and by the way mumble mumble
bidenmmmmmhjduejhhsmm trump i dont know what he said i dont even think he knows what he said
liar calling another person liar what a liar
trump why did you not say your the only president to sign a bill making easy access to medicated assisted treatment to get people away from and off that eventually killing the cartel cause you signed easy access even in rural areas people far away can see an online private doctor keep their privacy and get help therefore you already saved millions of lives cause it use to be hard to get help your bill to make medicated assisted treatmenteven available online even for rural areas where docs are impossible to reach you made online help possible you already saved millions with that single policy the answer is not lock away people who have unintentionally had a car accident or an issue it is getting them help especially for our own citizens returning their lives back to work leading productive lives i can expand on how well of a job you did and name all the lives saved because of the easy access bill that you signed making alternatives available i personally know many lives saved cause of that millions returning back to productive lives working living life again
moderators push trump for specifics answers but let biden ramble and avoid difficult responsestotally trying tip this in bidens favor
a really old man or a really bad man biden has my vote
biden looks lost as always
title should be who is least worst
did biden say i spoke to all those people who had died when talking about d day
that was embarrassing
did trump answer any questionsbillions of billions of unanswered questions imagine a debate where there was zero finger pointing and questions were actually answered
these guys
im so disappointed god help us
i think a cognitive skills test should be done on any candidate before taking charge im literally zoning out on the stupidity and lack of logic and reasoning sir please step aside and calm down
its kinda frustrating that a lot of the questions they are asking are not being answered by either person
rip the baby out on the 9th mouth is he talking about premature births woman are pregnant typically for 37 to 42 weeks 85 to 96 mouths
flip up the laptop and see how many secrets youve sold over the years and made millions of dollars you and your son lets see who the real criminal is here it was he remember you wouldnt be sitting in office today if that laptop had been open so lets say you did still the election
biden is the indian version of manmohan singh
you can tell when biden starts to lie is when he gets all wrinkly
did biden ever say one sentence without saying the idea
luxury hotel if your here illegally from wherever but your homeless son is on the streets
is it just me or when biden starts to talk im trying to breathe for him
we need to fight to keep biden in the race lol
biden also looks as this is the first time hes ever heard this every time trump says facts and looks upset that the moderators arent backing him up
biden also looks as this is the first time hes ever heard this every time trump says facts and looks upset that the moderators arent backing him up
i think it is the policy and his track record of getting things done and whether he kept his word after he was elected and how long term his vision is and what methodology he used to build the path towards that and whether his vision for global balance and peace was intricately and fairly constructed is what you should be arguing about instead of his humane mistakes that anyone can make no one is perfect come on america i thought your hearts were as big as your thighs and waists and big mac jumbo sets you being so small right now on biden
i remember 200 would fill two carts of groceriesnow gor 200 i get 50 worth of goods maybe 75
only one question would you let biden fly your plane that you were a passenger on
why cant we have a young presidentthere is no way these are our only choicescome on america we need to really pay attention
3333 we give them the weapons not the money at this point me ok so how much money have roy given them and how much money did the weapons youre giving them cost
trumpmultiple people have died and gone to war since your administration biden well iran attacked our soldiers and they got brain damage mebut did they die
trumpmultiple people have died and gone to war since your administration biden well iran attacked our soldiers and they got brain damage mebut did they die
i want to see joe swing a golf club only because he bragged
this is comedy gold
is this a comedy
biden is an absolute aweful individual good lord
its a sad world for people to think that biden is a good president hes far from it trump was by far the best president all the people that are for biden have twisted minds
gasoline was 217 per gallon in december of 2020 a year later 350 or more nationwide fjb
the lies by biden are staggering you killed thirteen servicemen on the afghan exit and denied it
bidens reactions are killing me
if you criticize biden your comments get blocked imagine that foad biden
id vote for biden in coma than voting for trump besides if he dies kamala harris would still do a better job than trump i used to think that george w bush was the worse president ever in modern era but trump surpassed him in light years its a nightmare that he could be president again
biden the idea trum this is the worst president in history of usa
how many times did biden say situation
if you tax the rich and the rich leaveyour plan ends medicaid and ss
honestly i just saw all the memes first then the full discussion biden is pretty mumbly and loses trains of thoughts but it wasnt as bad as the low lights have it seem
they are not my presidents
donald trump murdered great grandpa biden up in here trump
whats 1 gonna do to a billion pocket apwe the people should refuse paying anything over 50 a month for electric water all 1 bill not 150 on seprate energy bill
i think this is so brutal and cruel to let biden to run again he is too old
apparently everything was the best in history during these dudes time
he is turning to haley joel osment
maybe we could have just one questioned answered without all the insults and name calling sad state of america
alley catwho cares just like with clintonwho cares
all these amazing stories from biden but yet we are paying triple to live like we did three years ago
124 biden attacks trump about holding his own bag playing golf really i just saw a short where trump prevented melanie from falling when she tripped biden can barely support his own skeletal system and can barely talk let alone catch a woman when she falls or carry his own golf clubs he calls trump a whiner but he attack trump in an area that the whole entire nation knows is a weak jab because we have all witnessed him stumble he should feel ashamed for saying something so stupid childish and obviously that of a desperate man because his opponent is far stronger physically and politically that was weak and pathetic and the attack of a scared and whiney man trump was strong passionate civil and dignified
i like the part where biden coughed and slowly raised his hand to cover his mouth way too late then left his hand there for a good 5 seconds
candidates for elections in the usa are a logical consequence of the life and development of society on the one hand a megalomaniac and maniac a liar and an arrogant braggart with a mission to dominate the world stage his opponent depicts a part of society cut off from reality the consequences and the tragedy that his policy is causing around the world both puppets of excessive ego who from a position of power and calculation throughout history deceive themselves and everyone around them both victims of a system that cannot change creating the illusion of rivalry complement each other
and they still want trump to give up running for president even when biden cant get his words straight
baiden whenever trump takes the mic tf you saying
biden is like unfinished program ai
two creepy american people debating for unusual things
that wasnt so badwhats all the fuss about debating trump is like stepping into a cage with mike tyson on a fist full of angel dusthes selling his product with a nasty hook
trump remind me of my 5 yrs old alot of finger pointing and no accountability smfh
internally america is so weak and give lessons to others
support trump
an age limit for presidency should be imposed
i gotta say jake and dana acted shockingly professional given their severe cases of trump derangement syndrome
putin doesnt want all the cou try back which once was connected to solvet union he was pushed into the war by usa and nato destroying the minsk agreement i stand with russia 10000
i just feel so bad for biden please let him retire and im dead serious im not being funny
this was the best snl skit ever
4938 bidens face here
ha ha ha ha this is funny stuff
nobody biden and by the way
imagine all 300m americans electing biden who cant even realize that he is in front of cameras
3210 oh that face the big b looks horrified
that reminds me i will be making a good donation to a alzheimers charity
i come here for the comedy value
biden isnt respected by other countries trump isnt respected by the big cities
never interrupt an enemy while they are making a mistake
literally reminds me of my fist debate in social studies in middle school
biden is the winner
i asked some peeps to recommend me a comedy movie while i eat dinner they told me to watch this
rambling grandpa is right both of them
so unbiased moderators repeatedly cut off one side then focus on the other sides facial expressions so closely he willingly interrupts the debate to offer and rebuttal
ia this the only 2 choices america has got in population of millions
how dare our gaslighter in chief order the band to make a song for his wife disgusting
biden looking at the groundpodium as trump called democrats out on deleting january 6th information says it all before the excuseslies start the very least biden did was not come forward with the knowledge he had and that is criminal there is only one person running right now that should actually be convicted of a felonyor 34 based on the actual evidence we have in front of us dangerous precedent democrats want to set blatantly making up evidence to prosecute political opponents i try to be an honest person i know this already happens but at least they take the time to cover it up and not do it in public in front of everyone and then have half the population advocating for there to be no prosecution this is literally disgusting and be honest with yourself doesnt it sound like im talking about a third world country sadly no we are literally the worlds police as of this moment and you really think the world is going to let us continue in that role as we have political witch hunts like this im fairly certain we are going to get into a few more wars coming up and we wont be the good guys and its because of our habit of causing coups in places like ukraine and libya but never talking about that part then blast the world with propaganda about the events that came after the coup
the idea number 1 what happened look and by the way new drinking game idea
trumps face 3522
the former president trump is more stronger energetic intelligent and muscular
good opportunity to pre trump
bidenstraight jiberish
what is biden talking about honestly he doesnt make sense how is he president
american presidents just compet to know who is going to be the oldest president of history
dumb and dumber 2024 with jim retiring and joe in his place
the faces of these two are so much for entertainment
impeachment please should have been last year
trump all the way from india
in philippians 320 for our citizenship is in heaven if a persons citizenship is in bolivia by law he cannot vote in american elections or for that matter in any countrys elections other than bolivias even so a christian who is a citizen of heaven should not vote in an election of a nation on earth ii corinthians 520 adds another principle we are ambassadors for christ paul is specifically speaking of christian ministers see ephesians 620 but the principle applies to all christians since those christ has called are to be emissaries for him before the world matthew 5 1316 philippians 2 15 ii peter 2 1112 etc if the ambassador from mozambique were to meddle in the affairs of the united states even by merely trying to vote he would be in violation of international law in the same way a christian an ambassador of christs government cannot interfere in the affairs of another sovereign nation jesus himself provides a third principle in john 17 16 they his disciples christians are not of the world just as i am not of the world when god calls a person to repentance and conversion the new christian is summoned to forsake his former allegiances and throw his hand in with christ we see in the apostle paul that he considered everything before his conversion to be rubbish his loyalty was fixed entirely with christ from that point on philippians 3 311 if an american renounces his citizenship and takes citizenship in another country he is no longer allowed to vote in american electionsit is not his country a true christian must treat his citizenship in the same manner he is truly not of this world but of the kingdom of god colossians 1 13 see also john 1519 1836 james 44 revelation 184

everybody dont you think biden is the biggest trump supporter as long as im in the race trump will windefinitely
biden always sounds drunk slurring his words anyone else
trump supporters here
bidens face every time trump goes off on him has my stomach hurting from laughing
most dangerous place in the world afghanistan with a 2023 score of 3448 slightly safer than 2022s 3554 afghanistan remains the most dangerous country in the world for the sixth year in a row yemen syria south sudan dr congo russia ukraine none of these show that our border is the most dangerous place in the world fact checking
heavily edited
thank you wall street for keeping comments open unlike cnn
why does this look and sound like x factor
supposedly biden got more votes than any other president ever
these comments are making the debate so much better
is this laurel and hardy
i am 21 years old donald trump has my vote again maga2024 fjb
5730 when biden said errrwxaa awqyu i felt that what a way with words
is he the same person from the 2020 debate
i once respect usa as the greatest country on earth but now its a clown countryrip usa
he called him brandon lol
i find it annoying how the hosts keep cutting biden off i get a couple times they saved him from him completely forgetting what he was talking about but there was a number of times when he was making solid points
can someone oil that ole guys voice
5100 yeah the reason why is they dont want to get attacked and thrown under the bus by the democratic party just to get at trump
5054 we did see it with our own eyes and what i witnessed and what the news ran about trump afterwards are two totally different realities who am i going to believe what i saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears or what the news told me
4616 thats not even what he said joe listen the what he is saying just twisting words as hard as he possibly can
biden finnaly waking up 1026
hes the only president auhauheahahuahaeha 636
1155 trump actually looks sad to see biden in that state
veterans are not better off now i for one as a veteran cant stand you biden you are a complete disgrace to our country 2831 amen i wrote this comment before trump even saw this
post nato press conf by joe videos of joes bloopers that each covered years of him now all his gaffes have been shown by him in 1 day
watch the real debate with kennedy if you want to watch someone actually answer the questions
3950 this is how i feel shame on his wife and shame on his party for pushing him into these debates shame on u trump 2024 by a landslide
i fear the united states with what ever head is ruling i disagree with both these guys i dont know i feel sad
bidenwas slow and sluggish early on im sorry but its the yruthbiden seemed very odd too mei just eanyed too help him to bed
ya like a movie you already saw but its so good you watch it again
every time trump speaking joe biden
these two obviously no democracy neither candidates should even be selling vacuum cleaners
you know the us is a thing of the past and is done when you see these guys are your 2 potential presidentssad end for america bye usa until next time and good luck joining the developping countries you once made fun ofnow you are the joke of the worldwhat a shame so much lost potential it couldve really been great but its over now
trump talked the same way the first time around but the media did such a good job making it look like ignorance most believed it now when the media says trump is talking crazy we are saying is he really
is this the last recent debate because if you type that question in you get no response very slick of the news media or you tube anyhow ill turn this off and go right to barnaby jones because candidate guy 1 says under my regime we had the best 25 flavourings for coffee then candidate 2 guy says under my regime we warned american citizens of coffee flavourings so ill stay home on election day and switch to tea
trump wins the election by one vote he tries to find out who the last vote was it was biden he then says to biden after all this you still voted for me trump then changes his vote to biden which then makes it a tie they both get very emotional biden then leans in and makes out with trump on national televisionthey run away and live the rest of their lives together which leaves kanye west as the 47th president of the united states
i will take a person that stutters over a dishonest multibillionaire
cnn did a great job moderating the debate by muting mics and such biden coming out all sleepy like hey folks how are ya good to be here
i love this sitcom
i search youtube for the debate the actual debate is the 12th result looks like the algorithm is playing the field again
trump while biden is talking
beginning of the end of bidens campaign
ok wee have to the paris accord for the polution ok lol its politics bulshit and the peaple that believes this they are the problems
biden you are 80 plus wish is a blessing from god please go and enjoy the rest off your days on earth like going to play golf family vacations biden respectfully your not build for another 4 yrs be happy you became president for 4 yrs sorry after watching this your not getting my vote something is not right your health concerns me
we need younger candidates on both sides not just in the presidency
biden is the greatest president in anyones lifetime
trump is the way better man
learn about zionism youll be entertained and understand why the world is at war right now
yes get out of nature they are war criminal working for the wef
timestamps of moments trump was yelling
well he is right hes beat medicare to death
did biden go number 2 on the debate stage 11625
mr trump you are a true sigma i salute you and wish you a successful presidential election
wow obiden is a liar
biden is such a hateful liar
25 aint enough buddy we need to bring back the roosevelt tax
11145 he reduced it a little a little bit like this much still trump for 2024 though
donald trump the most electrifying president of the 21st century trump for president
1159 thats what youre looking for
bruh im 30 mins in and i have not a single fkn clue what biden is saying feel bad for trump
the most embarrassing moment in our country yeah this debate is giving that a run for its money
1153 covid i skibidi with
wow ive seen clips of this debate its even worse watching the whole thing biden is lost
did biden forget he is the president now why hasnt he done all these things hes talking about hes president right now
lets just have them box each other
this is cnns year and i hated them 2
you guys say my president is a lying why that doctor is not sueing him my pres is a worth billions
biden is a puppet whis controling him may b obama
trump and nigel farage need 2 get this world in order together they can do that if only you people all over the world wake up and do the rite thing
parkinsons disease is a very deadly disease hes probably been like this for who knows how long
great someone who thinks its an abortion if you kill the baby after its born vs someone too old to make a coherent sentence this is both hilarious to watch and absolutely terrifying to remember that i live here
now who farted i know you heard it who do you think did it
take a shot every time biden says the idea that
nursing home power
call the nursing home now
the comment section is
4 years on and we are still talking about covid row v wade and immigration
1550 alex alex jones predicted this on the joe rogan experience
jo sounds like he got a washrag in his mouth
it appears to me that biden is only running against trump as a vengeance not as an actual opponent sadly i dont think he has the country in mind
does biden only knows about the idea
biden embarrassment to the world
do we have a translators for biden
12635 he does not blink what is he on
joe looks so confused
i hate trump but hes the only one here still quite aware of what is going on and what he is saying
its wild that in 2024 biden wants to give only black peolle tax credits towards buying a home this is racist and a violation of the constitution
dearest the washington journal were looking for collaborating and speaking more about our electoral marathon would love correspondence ps hope you dont mind the promoting please would you tell me if you dont merkleykraft 24 well kiss well hold hands and well get married in front of our entire united states of america ry kraft for president lets bring our pride back to our united states of america lets make america better again why does our registry have over 60000 in our registry here in the portland metropolis alone but only 1000 are notarized its common sense issues like these that our fellows believe have been wellestablished decades ago when in reality were at basic level on so many pressing issues and also this is one that will most definitively get funded when i become vice president the first thing id do is sign off on a couple crucial executive orders focused on mental health and wellness in our leading enforcement positions hiring therapists and or psychiatrists per precinct with a clientdoctor confidentiality keeping our officers on the force and maintaining a nonbias nonmandated reportertype basis reprimanding retraining not removing hiring at least 1 law professional per state to mitigate negligible reoccurring persons and cases to escalate and determine an equitable fair outcome prior to allornothing offenses occur to aid not necessarily make life changes or decisions mandating cdltraining and potentially hiring process mitigation within our prison system and a broaderscaled technical training within our jail system as well as hiring at the very least a graveyard crew of 7 per state maintaining our countrys registry these i wholeheartedly believe key when building upon holding and in keeping a career there should never be despondency if theres an issue should we not be alotted to onthejob training if theres emotional turmoil should we not be alotted onthejob resources if were to be hired initially should we not have job security in every job position then theres border protection which is absolutely imperative key fundamentals of democratic policies like maintaining womens rights my body my choice in her right for an abortion equality in the workspace and full equality in general fighting for our citizens and trying to be the voice for everyone lowering our deficit focusing on climate change in every aspect from agriculture and permaculture to species on the brink of extinction rehabilitation and reassimilation to finding better pesticide and insecticide products that wont harm our critical benign insects like pollinators and seasonal nomadic to stopping any new big oil and gas development agreements working with all our world leaders to create policies best for us as the united states of america but also best for our world globally and so much more i would change so much of our marginalized communities as i can surely stress that its these citizens who take the brunt from every level the disparages of our system can seem unbearable and starting from the bottom all the way to the top one step at a time is how well enact a more equitable society but im still too young vp only we need to come together as the united states of america namely we all must work if weve need supplement of our govt as nationals we must volunteer at the least strictly in maintaining our society every one of us united states of america nationals deserve housing a job and financial aid maintaining one designated building in the heart of every downtown in every city to supply these needs will promote so much growth in such a rough market that we do currently face building upon our democratic leadership that i follow in direct cadence we must focus on police reform criminal reform and in fixing our mental health system building upon from the bottom to the top the middle out focusing on creating jobs in all sectors in semiconductors food processing manufacturing and absolutely focusing on bad banking practices and in fixing these issues in predatory lending triple loans reliance on corporations too big to fail then theres even housing reform 1 deed per citizen and or persons with dependents negotiable not mandatory implementations1 house 1 apartment complex 1 lease 1 corporation 1 entity 1 building highrise simple its clear to see that the real estate market is leading our economy and society without a single thread of oversight and its with shortsighted policies like these that skew misrepresent and shatter the current divide of our current american society immigration reform process and deportation with a negotiable warning or added criminal charges if the subject is already within the system and these undocumented crossings are continuous refugee asylum reform strict background check and applicating process case management oversight with weekly 1 hour appointments mandatory job seeking 3 per appointment governmental subsidies never be granted 10 years supplemental housing never be granted 10 years filibuster reform perfect proposals instrumental acts lifechanging bills imperative amendments that are yielded on the floor with a system in place of votedupon of yeays or nays unless getting at least the simple majority in the house 218435 and concurrently the simple majority in the senate 51100 theyre dead on arrival and the only pressure we have is filibustering eliminating motions that bring bills to the senate floor eliminating filibustering amendments and eliminating the noeffort filibuster would give every senator a voice but not a veto homelessness initiatives 1public loos in every city 2public electrical outlets in every city 3public laborready locales to work for at least 2000day in every city as these basic necessities are not only overlooked but unprovided as it stands whereas public defication is illegal whereas loitering is illegal whereas businesses bar our public from even using their services without exchanges of monies whereas finding 3 pennies is all thats promised from walking any citystreets for 24hours corporate credited reform many corporations have enabled refinancing loans credit aprs that at least double mandatedpayments with massive interest hikes risky mortgages that necessitate paychecktopaycheck 20year payments and these practices benefit mostly these entities while leaving so many of our fellow americans in close to impossible arrears judicial reform when so many massive discrepancies credible unjust lawsuits getting completely swept under the rug with dismissals incredulous taking sides and onesided judgements we need an infrastructure system in place to have oversight over these types of scenarios a much more involved supreme court financial regulatory reform bad banking practices affect our entire nation on nearly all levels from the bottom to the top with a select few able to regulate and it is allencompassing measures to assist our fellow citizens with a risk assessor payment deliberator and or an accountant who work for their clientele in reversing foreclosures stopping bankruptcies defusing exclusions and in having a judge to strictly mitigate banking cases will ease these monumental deficits and so very much more all our best team mercury ry kraft for president
people will try to play both sides on anything even remotely controversial moral equivalency is the most commonly played cowardly card of the modern age learn to think for yourself and speak the truth as well as you can manage
why ther are so many numbers and by the ways
they talk like we are in debate when they can make money every day and make as much as they want and taxes was low and everything was alot affordable when trump was in office we will b able to afford and live life happy again with trump in there trump 2024
i had such a good time
evil evil and evil what a future for allof as
trump always mean muggin
may be a boxing match before the election
biden is lying things have never been so high and this is very difficult for people on fixed income and very hard for the people of this country cannot buy a house or rent an apartment this is ridiculous raising taxes and the interest rate and it is going to crash the economy and put us in a depression
this is the person with the nuclear code im scared
look at him biden is not all the way there
trump is going to win this election
standing on own foot for so long commendable job mr president
i agree on the surface tax cuts for corporations etc seem unfair but those companies then are able to put more jobs in america versus overseas where they avoid the taxes thus providing more jobs for americans
100 groceries now 120thats a joke its at least double
trump is ready to rumble biden is ready to mumble
biden is washed up
hey can anyone confirm is it game over who actually lost
the whole world is blowing up behind biden presidency 3012
what the sigma
they both need to drop out get a regular citizen to go to the polls so much corruption in the government
they did not go by the rules moderaters sucked
2020 election was stolen
why a country so great like america has only these two very old men to lead them i really wonder
everytime biden was saying the idea he was like it felt like he was bout to say the ikea
who else feels unbearable pity for joe the fact that those closest to him are using and encouraging him is disgusting jill should be ashamed
watching from france i really enjoyed that south park episode
out of all the great human beings in the us you guys have a pick of these two bongos bravo
i know i dont get to follow politics as much as i should and honestly im not sure it matters who is at the head if the congress senate and house are actually working for the good of all people that said this was a disgrace when will candidates act like gentlemen again and not children to say they laid out any good information would be an extreme overstatement neither one answered the child care costs wouldnt matter anyway if theres a cost hike everything and everyone needs a hike to even it out at some point the number is irrelevant the mcdonalds employees will be paid1000hr and gas will be 300gal
so is this the us presidential debate in 2024 with the republician representative donald trump yapping over there on the left and democratic party representative joe biden putting an face on the right out of all the 90 minutes of the debate theres barely any question that was answered they were just having a chitchat of arguing that the opponents the worst presidents when theyre being ask about whether theyre capable of being elected as the president of the united states for the next 4 years what the debaters being arguing is about golf is this even revelent to the question literally no solution that was given to solve these problems espically for whether womens have the right to abortion joe biden over there were just talking about a case that happened when there was a women that was rapped by illegal immigrants whereas donald trump over there were blaming joe biden for letting the illegal immigrants into the border and thats basically what trump being saying throughout the debate i wonder if joe biden has been drinking alcohol before the debate because hes seriously drunk by mentioning about illegal immigrants rapping an women when hes the person whos responsible for opening up the border at texas the scary thing about this debate is not that what theyre debating its how theres only two people to vote
its wrong to abuse grandpar in the nursing home
its crazy that a man with dementia sounds more logical than trump trump is reactive and defensive he is just defending himself with lies and deflection i like trump and i think he has some valid point about the economy but he really comes off as a guy without a real plan this is terrible for america trump is right america is turning into a third world country where crooks with money is the only candidate option to run the country one is worse than the other
that picture of biden is from like 2012
these comments im dead
very true trump was the worst president the usa ever had since the start of this beautiful country america history trump should not be allowed to go back to the white house please please do not let him be back coz he is a person who thinks of himself only
mr trump how can you think to stop social security how do you think we old americans will live on remember we earned our social security pention with our hard works n contributed for that
what trump did of calling biden a criminal is very bad thing to say n very disrespectful to say to a president also we can say that is assignation of character i would not vote him even if he were the only candidate
my joy is only reading coments
the evolution of donald j trump is night and day in coherent speeches
the idea thatblah blah blah 1blah blah blah2blah blah blah oh and by the way you are a 2 joe you sound like a broken record answer the questions instead of diverting into another subject as though no one notices
its laughable how politics in usa goes now no matter who will take cabinet war is inevitable since they in same system trump only using current situation around israel ukraine as an excuses but he did nothing to prevent escalation in ukraine when he was in charge and that was the point when situation there was not good and already over thousand dead
559 sleepy joe dreaming about ice cream
bidens speech was so quiet i almost fell asleep
joe is going through dementia and alzheimers disease when are they going to make it public stop hiding these things from the people its okay its human hes older its okay to let go joe but to continue to try and stay in this fight is letting us americans down because you cannot fully commit to the presidential term
and he caused the inflation he is blaming headshot
what are you talking about we know what our veterans are going through the veterans dont even respect you biden
with the crimes that you and your son committed you should be in jail for treason
oh yeah what about all of our equipment that trump had build up and you left it for the enemy what about that biden
what do you expect with a fraudulent president puppet for china
yes they are and theyre draining our system thanks a lot biden
were these two clowns seriously arguing about who is the better golfer
hey biden what about your illegal underground government where you are standing by letting these covens rip off the american people what about that and youre stolen election
oh you mean obamas cages good for you
try not to laugh part 97 2024 presidential debate
nobody has commented about how black and empty bidens eyes are
taxes boston tea party would say none but after ww2 rich propped is up maybe like at being great and realize its china or some sand hill on the coast wants to give us tax breaks only the rich will be great
10525 did she really laugh
change the speed to 075x trust me on this one
either way im scared for our country i am powerless all i can do is pray
man this sure is one really funny presidential debate
sleepy joe had to think for abit and brought up medicare
speaking as elevator ds mother where both of us almost died i am for no abortion think about the beginning scene of charlottes webb now put a human baby in the place of wilbur
dear americans for years you have been making jokes about our politics im from italy but now let me say youre really screwed waayy more than us
crazy they still have this up
having listened to this debate up to the israel hamas issue i conclude biden is not obama but he isnt a write off as many claim hes a better deal for the americans than trump he could be having old age issues but he the better of two evils unless the democrats can pick a replacement now
shameless biden talking biggest supporter of war criminals and nazis
any biden supporters in these comments didnt think so
trump brags about country in very marketable way per training as a capitalist biden lies every chance he gets and spouts false information regularly yeah i am not voting
4156 on the right stands a man who has been in politics his whole life and has campaigned on the same issues his whole career but just cant get it right i got to go check his twenty or so year ago bid for president see how it was then also dont election candidates have a constitutional right to call a recount in each state
we are screwed button
1630 what
take a shot everytime biden says the idea that
obama the best one
1145 did jb just slip up and say what he did with covid somebody sit sleepy joe down
2 wings on the same bird
horrible partial birth abortion so evil
groceries have gone up way more than 20 stop playing us for fools joe sure did beat medicaid to death
they didnt say cnn enough
nope it has to be 70 years
one zionist auditioning for the leading role in walking dead and the other criminal auditioning for the role of al capone
how many times does biden say oh and by the way
who would have guessed that this would end up being one of the most consequential debates in american history edit and biden drops outoh boy
i have listened for a couple of minutes both biden and trump need step down we need younger leaders
look at bidens face mouth gaping open blank stare incoherent sentences and the list goes on bidens the president what a sham
ughbiden looks terrible barely alive should have cancelled this one he needs to rest one of most difficult jobs in the world 81 years old incredible
is it amust for some one to stand during debates biden seems weak he might even colapse
trump being braindead metaphorically biden being braindead literally hilarious
i cant believe this is the best we have to offer makes me want to run for president
all trump had to do was speak honestly and hed have won the debate instead all trump did was prove why george santos is still the perfect posterchild for todays republican party
biden was sharp and didnt fail except for one time in a lengthy portion his voice was weak but millions of people have weak voices and dont get promotions to higher paying jobs because of that so the problem is the capitalist wage system that causes world poverty because they expect and need some unemployed workerswho then cant buy food or medical care for their children danny thomas started st jude childrens hospital to help children who get cancer and their families get treatment because millions couldnt afford any medical care his vision evolved from wanting to build a general hospital in the early 1950s to becoming a childrens cancer research hospital which opened in 1962 and is still funded by generous donors at that time children had a 20 survival rate and now has a 94 survival rate for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using therapy that does not include radiation in 2006
me as neutral non american need to say biden is the biggest clown in the history of the us i remember a time where usa was the best countrry everyone wasd looking up to but now its just a shadow of its own
i cant talk right now im watching the season finale of the united states
as a veteran biden has done nothing but make things worse for me fjb
golf i prefer tennis
biden retire my friend i never voted i just dont go and spend time with the grand kids bro your in your golden years your only here one time mr president dust in the windwe are
this is just akward at this point
i am canadian but this video shows how biden is well educated man i can not get a sense of trump responses biden seems to be baby sitting donald
is biden reading a teleprompter
a your name its me for real aka clarence spencer aka meat meat good morning
biden has such a puzzling look on his face
run his name and its me for real aka clarence spencer aka meat meat good morning the one that talk to you
tell me your name me and the people of the world like to no you its me for real aka clarence spencer aka meat meat good morning
lets go to it its me for real aka clarence spencer aka meat meat good morning
the fact biden did actually label black people super predators is beyond wild in the act to change law and conviction towards black people
trump win for usa win for italia save the world
as far as drug addiction i think at some point we need to stop coddling the addict there are programs if the addict is serious about getting help for the president to be responsible for these addicts actions is ridiculous
the real president isnt born yet
yup hypocrites
i dont know who is telling biden that he is doing all this good stuff i dont see any of it i still live paycheck to paycheck and cant afford health care i wont be able to afford medicare when i retire either
i dont think biden did bad all trump did was lying
black mirrors best episode yet
bro practiced in front of the mirror before this for sure
trump forever love from dublin ireland
both candidates can have one memory lapse joe biden gets two
come on mr trump you are a peace monger and keeper for the world keep it up
where is robert kennedy jr i want a three man future debate not saying im voting for him either but just want to hear his take as well
biden lost the walk to the podium and lost america every second after
and the big winner is not the big guy
why cant trump answer a question without bashing biden
i never knew that elders fights are that bad
when the woman sitting said thank you so loud when biden was talking and he was like
i dont think biden can talk anymore
why does it look like biden is referring to answers on his tablets of paper i thought the media was not to provide these questions to the candidates prior to the debate but at 3358 theres old joe turning pages like hes moving ahead with the next answers hes been provided who is running the united states of america why is the msm covering for these traitors
they are both old i bet my grandpa will be a better president
the idea and by the way 2 lines this fjb used
stop calling him president trump he is convicted trump
president trump pass on deciding on picking sides this elections is for helping the whole america no war no assassination notricks rebuilding into the future you admit americas mistake and wrongs so that you all can build up no bridges with africa south americas the middle easts russia and china america is turning a new leaf make america great againg with equity real justice and comfortable living for all
why are their ties so horribly done
what a rout this was trump mopped the floor with this dementia patient
im 644 in and my first thought is that this seems phyiscally challenging for biden to even talk at this pace will he survive 90 minutes
trump its the right president the right men to be on power in usa
the idea that biden truly believes hes making sense and is mentally and physically fit to be president is flabbergasting
when he said groceries that costed 100 dollars are now 120 he must be talking dollar tree
the comment section just made my day may god help america
frankly speaking im here to see the comment section
he serious too price of gas that he caused
right joey if it were 2020 poor boy still reading old teleprompter from 2019 debate and first year horribly stuff in speech echoes still here like fr
both old and out of touch where the young americans
wowi finally got the guts to watch this im so sad now its a pity they cant realise that they are the same person
wondering if biden even knows where he is he looks lost just the way hes looking in empty air instead of looking at trump man i just lost in empty air
i searched biden debate and this video was buried under a 100 others
2121 this is what i heard and imma gonna ccontinue to move until we get to a total ban on tttthethethe total initiative relative to what were gonna do with more border patrol and more uugh side mufflers
most of you think of the comedy the truth of the matter is that this is the reason the whole world people are suffering hunger war exploitation please americans wake up and help the rest of the world do americans really care what is happening to the rest of the world
we are all so screwed is this the best we can do idiocracy has come home to roost both pathological liars not even good liars popostras statements both sides it was like watching two children go at it we are so screwed
trump looks very good calm and collected
joe youre fired
at this point trump has already won we should just let biden finally rest
this debate was more like a roast battle
better biden than a crooked trump
no one wants to be president
i have to turn up the volume every single time when joe speak
lol love it when trump says brandon just speak to them at 2225
why cant the us have a young president in hisher 40s
lets go brandon
anyone else thinking they should get married
dumb and dumber politics edition
dont ever let bro cook again
imma bout to fall on a sharpened spike on purpose
geez they both need to retire and be grandpas can we get newer and younger faces for both parties please
wow joe is really bad i think he actually believes that stuff being spoon fed to him
i know yall did not just lowball inflationseems like cnn is out of touch with whats really happening
i felt sorry for biden too whoever is running that country shouldnt have put him out there
as donald trump says the war between russia and ukraine should never have been started end of story donald trump best president of usa ever
oh is biden talking about that chip deal that pelosi set up because she had insider trading on it
at this point the best solution might be to change the rules and let obama have a third term biden and trump have turned politics into a circuslets bring back the ringmaster
good luck world
idk how democrats believe all the lies biden told and the moderators need to add a fact checker to these debates to keep the candidates honest unforutbately we have alot of guillible people watching this
so are we talking about politics or golf
if the us doesnt have the greatest economy in the world then who
blame game ruled instead of manifesto and solutions
rmglpon tyhipu murydet was bidens final words and i knew he was done
biden is the worst person in the world
000 introrules 209 biden entrance 227 trump entrance 250 economy high cost of livingbiden 510 economytrump 709 tariffs on other countries to help economytrump
im going to start wearing a really long power tie
trumps best move was not roasting joe and just letting him bury himself
im a canadian so this is hilarious but also incredibly scary and sad i could watch squirrels talk better than this
i got a huge bump in pay the day trump took officearmy idk what joes talking about
the blank stare there once was a lot but these days theres between those ears i honestly start to feel bad but then i remember this is voluntary he needs to just retire and enjoy his golden years
ofc the number of illegal border crossings dropped you made it legal im an independent but biden makes the choice so easy
look at 4610 biden couldnt even express himself that he wanted to rebuddle trumps response and they gave biden the time without him even asking when its trump asking he has to fight for the time
the beginning started with lies
after this video i decided to vote in favor of trump bro
my opinion lets be real here even not obama i would vote mr romney over mr trump and joe look what we have today just two guys talking about whose golf is better and beating medicare in 2012 election at least they are answering different questions fluently with reverent points and not hesitating and muttering before every single sentence like biden did its sad and worrying to see that michelle obama is not going to run for president because under modern democracy rules if joe biden doesnt want to quit we will be left with trump and biden but lets be real here trump is way better than joe in terms of points and topics though he lied what appears to be over 30 times he is still the crowd favourite and better that the other one biden whether you like him or not he is still one of the most successful and smart businessman and never make america look weak he is the obvious choice here ps back to 2012 to see what a real presidential debate needs to have
biden do not only damage america he also damage this world
wes ina
first comment
he looks like an 80 year old man who has worked for his last 60 years my grandfather had dimensia and joe certainly doesnt look like he has alzheimers hes put a great cabinet together a president shouldnt be doing the majority of the work plus joe has obama to help him run the country obama pulled the us out of a recession joe biden helped the us avoid a recession all trump did was lie this whole debate the us is way more respected then when trump was the president trump put tariffs on china and they went elsewhere to purchase their products putting farmers into bankruptcy trump is desperate to become president he doesnt want to face the facts of more court cases
i feel its like watching the devil taunting jesus with lies when he was on the cross yes biden is in a bad place but at least he isnt a downright liar etc
finally the big lie that biden was cognitively fit to be president is exposed for all to see
but to say most of what was and always been to say that we arent the best economy even in are current situation i found to be very wrong so where then what does biden think is the nation with the greatest economy if he didnt think were not it
corperate green he called the problem hum missed that
biden has a cheat sheet u can see it if you pay close attention
trump only knows how to lie
biden is so lost and trump being trump either way the world loses
i actually want obama back bro
this was a low intelectual debate
it is is simply astonishing how corrupt political leaders who litteraly destroyed their own country in a few years such as biden or macron in france have the nerves to pretend they saved it even when evidence are utterly against them just shows how low western countries have sunk with no bottom in sight hope trump prevails in november
biden is a liar not one bit of truth came out of his mouth fjb
did anyone else catch trump calling biden brandon at 2225
youtube flat out protects biden and censors just about any truthful non vulgar comments directed at his administration its a joke a horrific one and people want to say trump is akin to hitler people need to start being held accountable for this from top to bottom and be removed from any position they might have and in many cases brought up on criminal charges all the lies and supression that are allowing this country to be intentionally self sabotaged are completely what an attack on democracy looks like
its like watching the golden girls
biden said 1000 trillionaries god help you americans
were cooked
age limit for the love of god age limit
im not a fan of trump at all but trump absolutely owned biden in this interview biden is senile confused and totally demented
for the love of god country vote tulsi gabbard vp
biden needs to retire poor man can barely speak
as an indian i support trump
did biden forget about the 13 marines who died in afghanistan
cnn tonight there isnt any audience biden gestures at an unidentified crowd
vote trump guys demorats dont care about you
i guess voting kanye west to be president is not that bad afterall
the whole time biden looked like he was trying to remember if he left the oven on or not
debate between the president and the main opposition leader on the same television program it is sad that this is not something that can happen in turkey
while you have been sleeping joe our nation has gone to the pits do yourself a favor and listen to someone who knows how to run our country donald trump
as a indian i will say its look like a roasting show
its like a train wreckyou cant look away
he went to the funeralhow dare he show some respect
literally joe is passing away as we speak
oh joe shut up and go back to sleep
300 million and this is the best we can do omg
thanks from egypt i love usa
joe i was in the navy we have the worst broken down ships ever worst military i ever seen wake up from your nap joe joe
sadly biden is old being old is better than being selfish and scammer i dont trust trump he can negotiate with putin for personal gains
trump sounds like a total narcissist among all the other thingsi dont know how we have let go of all standards when it comes to presidential candidates i dont even know how this debate is real just a bunch of pointing fingers
i dont know how anyone could vote for biden i dont even understand how hes our president
resident yes resident biden says the government should decide on a womans health yet he mandates a vagseen hypocrisy much
free content record your grandparents debating this exact speech with a teleprompter boom ur welcome
god bless america not you joe
if you look at biden and teump and really think and compare the two on their policies biden wins every single time hands down the only thing you can say is that one has a speech impediment thats it
i know who im voting for and falling up stairs hast been done my my choice lol
trump 2024 for life
biden is a a real nightmare for usa society
puppet show
i dont get why people are surprised at bidens performance i genuinely couldnt tell a difference between this debate performance and all the other times ive seen him speak
how does anyone not see these repeating patterns biden opens the border then blames everyone for not passing a border bill biden gives iran 6 billion dollars then hamas attacks israel and hezbollah has a 25 billion dollar military biden is weak on putin with zero diplomacy then putin attacks ukraine this idiot creates all these problems then tries to either take credit for trying to fix it or passes blame
something wrong with your analysis
biden is too old and not excuses hes been done nothing worthwhile since hes been all his life
im voting for trump and without excuses nor exemptions
i grew up in a time where you were not supposed to say anything negative about the president but i have to say that our current president has screwed up on just about everything and you arent fooling anyone by opening our borders to get the only votes you will probably get please pass the office to one of the best presidents weve ever had donald trump
1hr and 40min straight of disparaging the other party and making outrageously false statements on both sides is this seriously the two people it comes down to give me a f8cking break
am going with trump
ask him what a computer chip does
hes way to old
trust the dog first
biden you lost touch with americans when companies move out of america when you forced them too
as a middle class citizen i was far financially better off under the trump administration than this current joke of an administration
this is truly sad
joes worst appearance yet
cant believe he is our president does anyone see this
does public housing included with this
why media has to host this presidential debates cnn where do you get your numbers for the reality of inflation from 100 to 120 bucks basket of groceries the only way this can be truth is a basket of maruchan noodles packets no milk no bread and no eggs
trump really didnt have to say anything just let biden talk and he wins
good job wsj you edited out all of bidens senior moments cheaters
gee we can see who youtube wants in the white house everytime trump starts to speak youtube goes to s commercial adnot once did youtube go to commercial while bumbler bidum spoke
where are the rest of the americans now
wow should be none
what does biden mean when he is offering breaks for black families what about the other ethnicities in america
is biden on the same planet we are
1204 1204 1204 look at fjb reaction he knows he did
why is joe reading from cards
biden is like a sloth and trump does nothing but tell humongous lies
no one over 70 allowed to run they have a minimum age they definitely need a maximum age
i think trump has proven himself to be shamelessly narcissistic which is never a good trait for a president but watching this country vote biden into office and then be so okay with his clear dementia and mental state makes me think this country is a joke most of my close circle are openly democratic and push everyone to vote that way but for christ sake its as if we are seeing two different things when talking about biden nobody in their right mind would want this man as their countrys puppet as the administration does what they want in the background
biden is logical and does not praise himself much trump will cause world war iii
i dont see a difference between this and a tntl vine compilation from 2016
best debate trump has ever done honestly very mature
apik turb bugattlwori in jermanycomiport
we went from voting for who we want to voting against who we dont want and this is what weve come to we need a third party we need ross perot for president a real businessman and not a big city conman and jesse ventura for vice president
why are they allowed to lie on tv
we need live statistics about facts they afe dropping thanks
biden is a person who prefer peace
the ukraine has hotter women than the israelis
next time its gonna directly take place in the retirement home as an european this debate is just so absurd and unreal to me that its almost funny but then i remember that these two clowns are potentially gonna be the next president of the us and thats where it gets sad
biden hes reading he literally sounds like hes reading
biden won has anyone else ever had trouble speaking with this technology attacking us i remember vividly when former president trump was president and had difficulty speaking we need vice president kamala harris to stay home and help with what she has experience incivil rights against abuse and torture
you ever hear any other president say something like im gonna seek retribution or hitler had great ideas no but ive heard a president refer to a group of voters as a racial slur the only president to ever use a racial slur when referring to american citizens and he was a democrat
they should have to provide trustworthy data sources with their answers
i dont know if i herd it write but did trump say that hamas is invading israel cause the only people who are getting killed blown up or having there homes exploded are the people of palatine
wow biden he needs to go home
neither one cares about child care
biden needed half an hour for the ritalin to kick in
two jokes on stage but at least trump will stop the invasion butcher joe is the worst president in us history the only good thing he did was raise social security but now hes destroying ssi by giving it to illegal invaders we need better than both of these
since when personal attacks are the norms in any debate
biden needs a medical care 247 and let trump take over the united states once and for all
trump turning his head looking at biden is crazy
why is joe biden putting blame on donald trump for every down fall you were president of united states of america for 4 years you had all the time to fix all these problems why didnt you joe when joe biden became the president of united states of america situations started to unfold literally
we really need true libertarians in the debates more options more candidates
im 20 mins in but so far i noticed biden lies way more than trump
trump at least he knows where he is and can form a coherent sentence
biden is the number 1 number 2 guy
a debate of the highest quality we can all look forward to a new era of dynamism and fresh ideas
a convicted felon and sexual predator in a presidential debate we are charting new territory integrity and honor dont seem to exist anymore a sexual predator able to run for the office of the president
the civilization will end soon looook who are the candidates for us president omg is this a joke
kinda feel bad for trump he had fo waste his time debating this clown
prices have not dropped with biden he is also adding more taxes on imports that raises prices
i cant believe these are the 2 best options this country can come up with they both lie their butts off
liberal scholars you cant be a scholar if you are liberal on paper yes philosophically no
how tf has he not been impeached were living under the most corrupt government that has ever existed why do democrats not realize that the earth has been going through climate changes since its existence so sick of our socialistcommunist government a revolution is long needed
i think biden is never done anything to his country trump is a powerful man we wanted trump must win god save trump
hosts were terrible
the price of food of groceries of rent absolutely everything has done nothing but go up under biden food had more than doubled biden and his partye are the most vile corrupt monsters that have ever lied in office
feel sorry for biden its pretty clear hes being dried across the finish line and he doesnt know himself
biden looks like one of the ghosts from the haunted mansion
how much is cut from this video
this is a clown show hahah
modi is going to be prime minister for 15 years another 3 years with biden wont hurt
haha the rest of the world is laughing at the usa because we cant believe how you still can consider trump as president and how he is not in jail
please please please vote for trump all of us need to if not we will all be doomed
whats good is you can just fast forward whenever joe speaks
watching this instead of the boys
hello from bulgaria there were never been so much corruption lies from politicians and media and so much despair and poverty into people hows in your country
creating victims to defend your administration or future economic plan im tired of the democratic party contaminated by socialist speech where they create victims of skin color victims of price of medication victims of big companies creating victims of genders yet introducing sexualized books into the childrens schools libraries that is their speech selfvictimization the speech of socialist with the tone of communist america and americans arent victims of none america is a great nation their people are hard workers resilient unified entrepreneurial people that is how it rose to the top of all nations
brandon just speak to them president trump to bumbling biden at 2227
i cant wait to see biden be re elected with 700 million votes this time
he was in france and spoke to all those dday heros that died wow
the comments section might just be indicative of this upcoming election
thank you the real debate no bs intros and voice overs
if we finally beat medicare joe biden
notice how biden literally denies everything
the tax system is not fair biden
both of these guys are not capable to be president biden the brain is gone and trump the way he talks about our alias like europe is scary he is in love with russia period and too cocky and talks to much and keeps repeating him self if there are americas top candidates we r in trouble for the next 4 years better of vote someone else the outcome will be better
biden did not come from scranton hes from delaware his wife was from pennsylvania but hes not im not sure where that came from
i feel if republicans would run anyone but trump they would easily win if democrats would run anyone but biden they would easily win the worst candidates
biden told the biggest lie this evening biden said the the border patrol endorsed him and not even 2 minutes later the border patrols official twitter tweeted that they never have and never will endorse joe biden
democrats republicans we need better choices
this is what trump meant when he said bloodbath lol
the mediators are too rich to go grocery shopping if it was up by 20 overall then its normal inflation its doubled everyone here is a joke isnt it suppose to be a top job we have such talented people in america and nobody else wants this job
indians thinking about modiji and rahul gandhi
why do people keep saying bidens mental health is deteriorating wasnt he always like this
manchurian candiddate
2 clowns
trump who really loves america and american people should be next president in america
ok guys the joke isnt funny anymore who are the real presidential candidates
im sick of hearing the word the idea
they both lie but almost everything out of bidens mouth was an easily verifiable lie with simple google searches on his claims
let me put it in a different and more easily understandable way there was a time in the us where moderate republicans and democrats shared common interests together despite their political and ideological differences it is that order which trump and his cult followers have shaken up since 2016 followed by the biden counterblock now which isnt any better either its bad for the peace of both sides since they are being taken over by the extreme fringes on either side now as i said and this will only create more division domestically by the way here in europe and especially in germany we have experiences over many decades with leftwing and rightwing radicals always at each others throats since neither of them will ever compromise to the other extreme hence they are not solving any problems only creating more chaos thats why we have additional political parties in the center in europe who can tame both sides and introduce common ground and consensus in a professional manner accepted by everyone they say ronald reagan and john f kennedy were such presidents to name some american equivalents in history bringing lefties and righties together has never been easy though its like mixing salt and sugar but it can taste good if done correctly
i dont understand what this dude is talking jesus biden just stop
im a single white mom i work full time no government benefits and i cant afford to sew a dr because of copays my grocery bill rent has all went up
the limited twoparty system in tne us now shows its design flaws and vulnerabilities if you can only have the communist farleft controlling biden or the fascist farright acting behind trump rule a country now then neither outcome will be beneficial for the majority of people unless you directly belong to one of the extreme fringes or hold some prestige or power position there whether you accept it or not depending which side you root for this is the political reality in the us today
this debate is rigged the panel gives biden the time to respond but they never give that time to trump to respond it is always a new question to trump
ukraine should not be nato period
this debate was like watching a lion trump vs a baby gazelle biden
jobs for americans from all over the world hey joe you have shown we cant be trusted
poetin wants peace he was put with his back against the wall with ukra√Øne nato could come way to close to russian borders and also he is protecting those in ukra√Øne that are under threat of the other parties in ukra√Øne both trump and biden do not seem to know what is really going on and i cant take either seriously
opoid that due to open borders caused by bidden
i love the way western government run their elections
you have the morals of an alley cat
2225 did he call him brandon
but trump is clearly lying
why was a teleprompter allowed
actually when you listen to biden yet againhe didnt perform as badly as some in the comment section put it
is this american got talents
they just caught an illegal ms13 terrorist in maryland last week
did anyone see the mediators face when president biden said something snapped in you when you lost the last time and mr trump was smiling she looked she was fighting hold back laughter i wondered how on earth those two mediators found the power to maintain their composure through all of this thats the resolve america needs to be great
dynamic don vs sleepy joe
president biden is suffering from something you can see it just in the first few minutes of the debate compared to before i am not a doctor but i know what that looks like does it mean he is suffering from parkinsons not necessarily there are a lot of things that can look like parkinsons does it mean he needs to be looked at and monitored yes he could just be sick with something i dont know because i havent watched him over the years people would have to watch him over the next debates and his daily interactions you dont know what hes dealing with there might be other forces at play that we just dont know about i will say this i know exactly what that looks like to me but again i am no doctor and i dont watch the news or tv very much at all the only way to truly know is for him to take levodopa carbidopa and watch what happens i will say this if he decides to run again his aides his top advisors and any professors that are in his confidence will be more pronounced as they should be anyway if he is suffering in silence you would see effectively mostly just his aides and professors which ultimately you have to decide if thats a good or bad thing he needs to stay active in order to not get locked up if it is the case he would need therapy physical occupational and linguistically daily and constant interaction for any person suffering from it what matters is having meaning and seeing the people that matter most to you other presidents suffered mightily from other neurological diseases with the help of aides and advisors besides their own vice president
bring obama back simple
as a veteran the ability to have the choice to see nonva care provider when the wait to see a va care provider is too long was important these were special circumstances but important now the va has been instructed to stop allowing veterans the choice to be seen by nonva providers
831 their faces i cant
things went south from 12025
gooooo trump we love you
biden looks scary
yah we need it cause of all your failures biden
a acutely feel bad for biden the people pushing him toward need to have a word with them selves seriously at him its over
n0 this is the worst shape we have ever been in they trust you he has lost it
as an international observer and democrat myself i pity americans in 2024 they have the worst choice to make this year in any presidential election mad trump or sleepy joe needless to say you will only be satisified if you belong to the political hardcore base of any of the two candidates while ignoring the other half 50 of the country for everyone else in the middle neither choice will do meaning rightwing conservatives will love trump while leftwing progressives will totally be devastated and the other way round if jb was to be reelected this will further divide the us domestically any direction this goes
trumps the best president in all history we love trump
theres the proof ask the people then the will tell you
yah the worst is you how come he has all the supporters then you got none
he is so twisted
sure looks like he is listening to someone with ear phones
what have you done nothing but destroy our country
sleepy joe lost that debate all he was trying to do was irritate trump and get him going and it didnt work
biden looks as if hes seeing the grim reaper staying in the corner of the room when he looks up
cnn have really shown this time how politically ideological they have become over the years and wont accept any criticism of joe biden the proof is right in front of everyones eyes wsj and other media outlets allow comments on the presidential debates even fox news but only cnn have closed the comment section from the getgo which is very unusual for them since they always allow commenting on any topic imaginable out there
im on social security we can barely get by why dont we cut your wages why should you get paid so much more money and live in mansions by the rest of us especially veterans our veterans should be living like kings and queens not people like president biden they should cut their wages and live like we do lower class part of the rich why dont you pay more money your pocket biden youre one of the rich youre not paying more taxes
im on social security we can barely get by why dont we cut your wages why should you get paid so much more money and live in mansions by the rest of us especially veterans our veterans should be living like kings and queens not people like president biden they should cut their wages and live like we do lower class part of the rich why dont you pay more money your pocket
food prices and living expenses is up over probably 500 because hes in office biden
hes speaking like an american would speak their opinion and their truth not sugarcoating everything like biden is doing
episode dr phil inside chinas secret plan to control america this is a must watch everyone highly important information for us all please watch
this isnt about how terribly performed they did in debate it is about as an american you have only these 2 options a childish criminal or a walking corpse
im sorry that im not enjoying this debate and biden is not convincing me he is good for this country trump was president we could afford to live people like me that are in the lower class can barely buy food what is buy gonna do to fix that get rid of us make us sleep in homeless shelters tents on the streets where they all live in their mansions and i think about the lower class people and making them for things like food and housing everything is out of control im pretty sure people are living in the streets the democrats are gonna be living in their mansions
biden is probably planning to try to win the presidency only to hand over the presidency to kamala after a month or so like his original plan until someone confronted him about his plans
im sorry that im not enjoying this debate and biden is not convincing me he is good for this country trump was president we could afford to live people like me that are in the lower class can barely buy food what is buy gonna do to fix that get rid of us make us sleep in homeless shelters tents on the streets where they all live in their mansions and i think about the lower class people and making them for things like food and housing everything is out of control im pretty sure people are living in the streets the democrats are gonna be living in their mansions
why does biden keep on slandering trump hes not talking about how to fix the problem all he is doing is slandering without proof and facts hes not doing anything to show how to fix it or say things to fix it i dont think he knows where hes at
why does biden keep on slandering trump hes not talking about how to fix the problem all he is doing is slandering without proof and facts hes not doing anything to show how to fix it or say things to fix it i dont think he knows where hes at
i cant believe that cnn has been so hooked into sickdem political ideology that its producers didnt know how mentally incapacitated jb is
for around 250 years until somebody changed the laws yet biden claims because something has been the law for 51 years makes it a good thing it should be that trump should have said i will use the same tools that the democrats have made and used if its good for the goose its good for the gander
this like a netflix episode get da popcorn rdy
in the bible its up to the father to decide if he wants the baby if not the baby is left outside to fend for itself
what does trump mean when he says black jobs
people yes love usa
why is it that when you looking for work you need to do all sorts of tests and interviews when you are president nah brah he old
america is doomed man
everytime i look around there stands a mexican
he installed jobs well how come the mexicans get a better position in a good job before americans
separate from political preferences i personally start to worry seeing that biden has sole power to launches nuclear missiles
somebody please just take biden home and give him the love and care an elderly deserves
demoncrats are something else
i pity you all in the usa if this is your choicetragicand sad too
one thing is for sure trump was correct in that most of the world do not respect or look up to america anymore the seriousness of the problems will take more effort than biden or his followers can stomach if they think jan 6th was bad wait till they start getting xenophobic attacks take it from us that know gov can play all the dirty tricks to stay in power until the people just had enough
poor biden his face touched my heart please vote for biden hes the best
4607 here he actually talks coherently without stuttering or pausing for a good while almost like being utterly offended is what woke him up lol
americans uhm dont you have uhhh any other parties
so american elections are about dumb vs dumber presidents lol
god were so cooked
the world is falling apart because of democracy
seriously i woke up depressed and began to read the comments here now im having abdominal aches of laughing so much nonstop thanks yall
the questions arent getting answered trump has to respond to the ridiculous claims and gets no time to answer questions
wake up joe mf
he will not block the pill if 90 percent of all abs are done with the pill whats the problem
biden doesnt even look like hes focused hes day dreaming and confused
trump save the world 2024
trump is like seabiscuit hes banged up a little but in the end he shows you what hes made of a winner
some said trump was running on the ceiling and spitting biden was crawling on the floor and peeing but in fact two pensioners are talking about something it would be nice for them to sit next to each other on a bench and gossip
my favorite part was watching whoever wasnt talking i got a good laugh out of the facial expressions
abortion is against christianity killing of innocent babies during pregnancy is unlawful this should must be completely stop you killing babies that could develop the world when they grown up to adults please stop abortion during pregnancy
great leader and president joe biden i suggest he remain as president of usa
the tax increase on the rich wouldnt make a difference because of tax cuts
isrealies hawaiins what are we doing
great speech usa president joe biden
loss of jobs cause of covid
created 800k jobs where not here
you have the morals of an alley cat lol
again youre not the father lol
for those of you reading this comment its okay its normal to feel lonely sometimes if youre going through tough times keep trying but never give up
were cooked
both biden and trump are horrible options for the president and im disappointed in and afraid for this country that these 2 have managed to get this far joe biden isnt all there and trump is being charged for dubious activities
biden pretends to be catholicyet he argues for abortion
well i doubt trump called war heroes and those that died losers and suckers that just sounds made up but its a fact what biden has said about black americans and its not cool joe bidens timeline of racial comments and actions from 1971 to 1974 bidens legal residence had a deed barring ownership by african americans in 1974 biden made an analogy of himself as a 29 year old in the senate to being a token black in 1975 biden asked if the only way a black man or woman can learn is if they rub shoulders with my white child in 1977 biden said that busing would cause his children to grow up in a racial jungle in 1977 biden voted against black justice department nominees specifically over his opposition to busing in 1977 biden said he asked to join the senate judiciary committee specifically to lead the charge against busing in 1979 biden voted to allow racially segregated private schools to keep their tax exempt status in 1981 biden said george wallace was right about some things in 1984 biden used the word boy to refer to jesse jackson in 1985 biden made a favorable comparison between segregationist senator john stennis and confederate general stonewall jackson in 1987 biden sought to appeal to white voters by touting an award he received from george wallace in 1973 where he praised biden as one of the outstanding young politicians in america during his 1988 campaign biden falsely claimed he was part of the civil rights movement saying he marched in his youth in 2006 biden said you cannot go to a 711 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent in his 2007 book promises to keep biden admitted that as a young person he had no real relationships with black people in 2007 biden called thensen barack obama the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nicelooking guy in 2010 biden delivered a 22minute eulogy the longest speech at senator robert byrds dwv memorial service calling the former kkk member a friend mentor and guide in 2016 biden praised segregationist senator john stennis as a friend and an honorable man in 2019 biden recalled the era when he was able to get along with segregationist senators in 2019 biden boasted that segregationist senator james eastland called him son not boy in 2019 biden said the obama administration went into the hood of detroit to recruit minorities in 2019 biden claimed a major problem black communities face is illiteracy saying black parents cant read or write themselves leaving black attendees shocked and frustrated in 2019 biden said that poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids in 2020 biden suggested some people were able to quarantine during covid because some black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf
like i said previously golf doesnt take brains running the country does
i havent watched this yet because it doesnt really mean anything to me as a canadian im only here for the laughs
maga i have no idea what joe is talking about
vote for robert kennedy if you truly wanna make america great again
vote for robert kennedy 2024 if your tired of the 2
its a great video ive been following it
agree with president trump
women should decide what to do with their bodies
president trump please save us form this disaster
putin is dragging his feet so it breaks us financially while china weakens us with fentanyl and buys up our food supply we are in ww3 and too stupid to realize
man we need trump in the office he know what hes doing we need him asap trump 2024 lets goooooo
its disgusting to me that the president is held responsible for things people chose to do people voted biden in and are still going to vote him in when really its obama thats pulling his strings so really people are voting for obama they are afraid of trump becoming king well wth do you think obama is if he is control of our president guess what if we vote michelle in barack is in the white house again exactly what a dictator would do to hide fact that he is a dictator sneak back into power we cannot let this keep going obama had his terms and he screwed us overget these guys the eff out of the white house
everything will be fine and you will shine like a rising star with great success and wealth
also comment on your favorite parts and leave a time stamp
biden still spewing the charlottesville lie
shumner will do whats good for shumner
i am from asian this debate is pain in my s both dont even competent to be any leader if they in asian what a joke
kennedy for president look into him and his values we have a third option lets make history
if you guys go back to the debates from 2020 the mental decline from joe is insane
they were more passionate about who had a lower golf handicap than any of the real issues
why is this man still coming back as a presidential candidate is there no any other person americans whats wrong with you
i thought we were watching the miser brothers christmas special
to be honest illegal immigrations impact will blow the fan when in november the package for free hotel and food expires biden closed pipeline for energy security he gave 200 billion to corrupt zelensky and especially did nothing about crime and homeless people about inflation is not just 20 in four years its over 120 millions of citizens are in food stamps biden has to be replaced as he has cognitive dissonance and couldnt speak well technically he lost what he was speaking over 14 times in this debate
biden may be the first president in history with plausible deniability the reason he looks so dumbfounded every time trump speaks is because this is quite literally the first time hes hearing any of this information all he has to go by is whats dripfed to him by his personal handlers they keep him in a bubble of lies and misinformation
just my two cents 5558 black what did he almost say a racial slur truth of the matter is the black community support trump while the immigrants support biden 10014 big respect to trump for what hes done for the black community including the ones in prison like kodak black lil wayne etc 10441 biden doesnt see any major issue with pollution and climate change has those weekly hurricanes not sent enough of a message 10535 his plan for ss is to take 6 from middle class and 1 from wealthy class then proceeds to lie about a lot of other things what is wrong with this guy 12014 actually to say you dont need education to get into the semiconductor field is just something to laugh at you basically need a phd in electronics and other degrees too 12122 this is really something to laugh about his inability to speak about a subject due to his old age enough of the golf why dont they both have a celebrity boxing match i am sure mike tyson would train trump idk what else to say for biden
trump is hilarious
if you think all of this foolishness was going on under trumps watch then you simply dont pay attention to your surroundings the proof is also right in front of your eyes here when you look at biden make his silly faces and listen the responses coming out of his mouth
media of america making money money talks become silent
no inflation before biden came into office my family wouldve been able to qualify to purchase home however being active duty military at the time we didnt now now that ive been retired at this rate under biden i will be at retiring age before i could come close to qualifying for purchasing a home
i thought this was a presidential debate and not a try not to answer as many questions as possible challenge
didnt watch this wont watch this will not change the fact that im voting for democracy this fall
take care of americans first
caused brain damage ok if your brain doesnt work to capacity of completing a full sentence then you have no business opening your mouth
trump still got that hair while biden is going bald and has bald spots
why does it seem like biden is constantly having minor strokes while attempting to defend himself his administration andor everything that is questioned on his behalf
i work at a small construction company the owner is a real nice guy but hes like 85 years old super good man took care of his wife of over 50 years who had dementia until her final day he always just eats out and very rarely goes to the grocery store he recently went to the grocery store a few days later he gave our small crew a 350 per hour raise ive worked there about 30 years i thanked him for the pay increase he teared up and said he was sad to see the state of our country and were family and have to look out for each i agreed fully and told him we are family
the usa is not the largest polluters in the world china india and russia chinas coal consumption is the highest in the world accounting for nearly 55 of the global total which is about 848 of the worlds total consumption this makes india the second largest consumer of coal in the world after china russia is the worlds fifth largest consumer of coal accounting for about 202 of the worlds total consumption in 2008 the us used about 28 million tons of coal per day but by 2023 that number had dropped to about 11 million tons per day a 62 decrease
all these aliens in body suits are crazy
ctfu your vote still wont matter the president is pre determined both parties work together presidency is pure entertainment just like sports music etc smh
they should put the asked questions on the screen even i forget the original question as i answer
biden from scranton pennsylvania i forgot the show the office was based on him in his early years
dreams are real
biden we have the most successful economy in the world geeshwhat do the other countries look like if we are now in our current state
i hate trumb and biden the usa sucks nowadays gaysabortionliberalism the usa was a utopia now its a dystopia
im a 24 year old nobody with crippling social anxiety and somehow i bet even id be more eloquent in a public debate than either of these two clowns
he did beat mid care but beat it to death dud you see biden face
yer the sucker
312 bro is flabbergasted and we didnt even start
i used to get approximately 60 count egg cartons from walmart for like 3 bucks at one point and now theyre like 12 dabloons bruh what the freaky
i voted for biden in 2020 but i cant do that in 2024 this is ridiculous
this is wild and for me the abc interview is the cherry on top
my mans blink hard asf when he pronounce words
the only convicted felon im looking at is the one in looking at now
come one come all see the amazing biden watch his brain melt right before youre eyes
hahaha it was an insurrection they turned over desks and broke doors and knocked down statues that is what joe biden said happened sounds like trespassing and vandalism at worst
biden talks so proudly about his welldone job because he talks from the satanist perspective which is creating chaos and suffering nonstop for all of humanity
i cant with bidens confused expressions staring into space them calling each other suckers and biden calling trump a whiner this feels like a black mirror comedy episode of two jokers for core world leaders i hate to have more to make fun of about biden biden also reminds me of the meme when you had a dream and the dream and you had a dream that you
drinking game take a shot every time biden says the idea lemme know how it goes
killing a baby even 1 2 or 3 months into pregnancy is an unacceptable cruel and barbaric act unless the mothers life is in danger otherwise she should deliver the baby and if she cannot care for the baby give it up for adoption
kamla harris potential to defeat trump
biden is lost hes there but nobodys there go answer the door
im having fun laughing at literally everyone related to this but then i remember i live in this country
were also in a situation where
magacnn will not tell you but i will at the debate the questions were changed at the last minute biden was never told but trump knew the answers because he knew it was happening this would throw off anyones game plan for a debate cnn ceo is one of the mega donors for the trump campaign
these two both need to retire instead of squabling on public tv
the idea the idea the idea joe this is the first time youve had any idea
sorry to say but my bank account had more money in it when trump was in office biden im struggling to keep money in my account that says something to me gas went back up the first week biden took office
it is really funny how they call each other this guy
this is dull
biden is showing characteristics similar to my mother who had dementia
2341 that is not a presidential look
the idea
biden had over 1 week to prepare for this whats more he set all the parameters of the debate who would do it who could participate not rfk jr how long to respond 2 breaks never in past presidential debates he knew all the questions beforehand plus he was obviously medicated refused to take a drug test before the debate in my opinion he did very well just like his wife said in the tone youd use for a 3 year old the best he could im talking about his performance only not his policies which are clearly meant to destroy the usa good follower of the wef antiusa antihuman agenda i think trump could have performed better by being more specific about the economy his accomplishments in fact i dont understand what the left thinks trump lied about i didnt hear any lies from trump but i did from biden anyone surprised by bidens demeanor and behavior has clearly been watching the wrong media its been abundantly documented for years ask yourslef if you need a new news source because you are not getting the truth strangest comment biden saying women need abortion bc of being raped by their in laws and sisters sure that happens in his family showers with 12 year old ashley but thankfully few people can relate to that biden looks like he had a stroke when he smiled 12 his face was paralyzed but no one mentions that
lets go brandon
anyways i like trump his audacity is second to none
the amount of times biden says the idea reminds me of the chart of transitions my writing teacher showed me
ths 2 men were so cool when were young that its easy to forgive all this light nightmare
trump speak loud and clear biden cant explain anything i dont understand him make trump win and let him stop the war make the world great again
now usa presidents debating over who is better at golf
they compete over who is the worst how ironic
who came to the comments before the comedy
im irish and living in ireland and i can even see ans say trump done good for america i hope he wins
a couple of old heads why do we have old heads running this country get a millennial in office or vote independent this reminds me of the 5th grade debates in elementary school why are senior citizens running go retire and let the millennials take over
if it werent for nonsense biden doesnt make sense at all save our country trump 2024
to be honest i feel sad for biden to be in such a state at such critical state of this country let him rest in his mansion
trump is having a field day with bidden
jo should have went second he needs a chance to get stable pretty bad trump doesnt care to interrupt tina
biden the only convicted felon on stage is the man im looking at right now keeps looking at the news anchor
biden cant even speak god save the us nation danm
how dare joebiden be so ignorant and misogynistic as to deny kamala harrisher turn to step up as the democrat contender for the white house
i agree with trump tbh
the idea the idea
trump is a troll period
y president biden looking at papers612 hope the interview is not scripted
trump for the win biden go home and sleep
trump is projecting his own plans onto biden about ww3
dana why didnt you ask trump about his mental illness
trump did nothing when mbs killed and dismembered a reporter and hes saying we wont pay hostage holders
yooooooo some balablue for nigerians
format trump lies biden protests it cnn says ok thank you president biden
i dont think biden helped his campaign
15 minutes in when trump said the vote is up to the people on that topic biden shakes his head
after watching a second time i think potus biden will be our finest president ever
good luck americans
seems like the only thing biden could do is use fake quotes that make trump look bad when he wasnt mumbling and rambling trump said this trump said that all lies why would the moderators only allow biden time to respond and never allow trump to respond to the lies biden was saying about trump this was sad to watch how can anyone take biden seriously
trump also had teams of people at ny trial claiming nyc is corrupt so what that 19 people say you didnt say it
how can tapper and bash allow trump to call biden a liar without reminding trump of his 30000 lies he told in first term
since biden i have aca rural internet service and a boost in ss benefits
one of these two mad jokers control america and world
one partially losing it and one is full of himself
how did we get here with these two
trump is repeatedly ignored for all of his lies
biden answered the question dana
the neutrals would be the greatest beneficiaries of this entertainment oh its a debate
youre wrongno youre wrongpointless debate
actually biden is one of our best potus ever
if this is biden with a cold hes our man
trump constantly bulldozes biden and cnn says nothing
i did nothing wrong trumps most repeated claim doesnt that say enough
biden is accustomed to dealing with at least sanity not complete lies and gaslighting
with all due respect but i thought we in bulgaria have to regularly choose between bad and worse i guess we are not alone
4100 trumps lie is absolutely overlooked by cnn disgraceful
us politics is pure popcorn right now
why wasnt the question askedhow much has joe biden made in politics and how much trump has lost
crazy how they not like us has more views than this
so americans have 2 choices worse or worst by default trump gets my vote
at 2500 biden is stunned into combatting lie after lie
maybe leaving the comments section open will give wsj an insight to what the people want maybe
rip the baby out of the womb but trump did better huh please wake up and choose the sane one
just answer the questions
39mins in i cant watch anymore this is an absolute joke america if you vote this guy in again you should be ashamed a sad day for democracy
usa is lucky we have the legislative and judicial branches so either candidate wont burn down the country i cant wait for the vp debate
greetings from europe
jb didnt even know he was at the debate
trump shook his head to turning civil rights over to the states wasnt that called the confederacy
even though im not a us citizen and i have no right to say anything but mr biden is a joke and have no idea what hes talking about seriously i cant believe how americans vote for him honestly i used to be a student back in the days in the states and i love this country but what i dont like is how the system run seems to me like personal issues comes all together against the country itself good luck americans i hope this time you guys make a right decision and choose mr trump
lying lying lying and people still want him in charge a lying narcissist and you people think hes better
someone is speaking to biden and in his ear watch him hes listening
oh finally at 78 81 neither of these should be in charge of such a powerful nation
im not trying to make this seem like a joke in anyway this is a very serious situation but the only thing that i got out of this is that biden gave some serious privilegesmoney and in education to black people ive been sleeping in my car working hot and i cannot afford a place to sleep the blue collar world is hurting with this immigration whats going on is insane
trillions of dollars coming back to our country trillions left into the wealthiests pockets
mr trump sounds more convincing and trustworthy
hes right he did beat medicare he beat it to death trump
for all yall watching if you want to kn ow what dementia looks like just take bidens face for most of the debate and youy have that trump 2024
for the love of god get this biden character out of office america is dying
if trump told people to be violent why havent to seen a single video of him saying that he said to go there peacefully for crying out loud lol
trump the uk sees you as an embarrassment dangerous to be in power you have made america a circus
im honestly ashamed of the united states two old men older than putin are fighting for power have you lost your mind
fjb trump2024
biden is clearly now too slow in mind to be president again and trump isnt the one wed have to fear if he got into office congress will keep him in check its the millions of right wing supporters he attracts who mascerad as patriots both men should be excluded from being president america is screwed with either one of these men in office and possibly the entire globe
joe biden will and has said he will expire trumps tax cuts in 2025 that means every tax bracket will go up so biden is lying again biden wants to increase tax spending to 5 trillion per year that means everyone will feel the pain
america is humiliation of human kind lately and funny thing is that this humiliation of a country controls europe
trump is coming back with a new strategy
i dont care what biden did for the last 50 years nobody deserves this this is down right elder abuse
i think that president represents it people very well we have old marazmatic in usa we have clown in ukraine we have best president in the world putin
love the exchange of insult best comedy movie there is nothing better than watching old men exchange insults hhh regardless of the nonsense with biden health and aging man i still would not vote for trump trump is not a good choice for america hell bring more problems than solutions
biden too old for this job trump is totally mocking this guy
president biden clearly won this debate president biden had specific answers to specific questions president trump was not specific with his answers to questions and seemed to evade the questions theres nothing wrong with president biden cognitively
populism always blame on immigrants or the colored here migrants never touch on the fundamental cause
the people of this country should let both of these men retire and spend their old age relaxing with their family in their final years not trying to run a country this responsibility is too much for these guys people in america are not being kind to continue voting for endorsing and pushing these elderly men who are obviously tired to run an entire country please people help figure out a way to pick two other people n haley vs k harris let these men rest
something is wrong in this debate i keep ended up here
i know what biden is doing i saw it in 2016 in my country he plays the victim and can emotionally influence the electorate if trump tries to humiliate him he will lose sympathy people sympathize with the wounded not with the tricksters so regardless of whether its natural or fake biden can win if trump doesnt stop humiliating his opponent he didnt and i hope he will not he is a smart guy
i activated subtitles and it cant recognise when biden speaks
what a time to be fluent in english meus amigos what a time
america is a large democratic country and presidential debate is a charm we love usa
usa needs two other candidates in the race
trump won thats clearbut his position about war in ukraine is too naive i mean theres no way that putin and zele will make peace you need to choose rus or ukr thats all and biden in that spectacular moment was right when he said politics doesnt work like that
bring back regan even though he is dead
what lala land does biden and his staff live in we arent senile like him and we remember how good things were under the trump administration and how bad things have been under biden the last 4 years
i enjoyed that debate trump did way more better than he did 2020 and 2016
biden is shot trump the og
according to milton friedman inflation is caused by one thing government biden is spending america into bankruptcy ww3
exactly trump and everything biden always accused you of are exactly what he personally did himself 202172024
finally after 3 yrs ive come to realise as to why bramdon isso much in favour of lgbtq bcoz the 1st 3 letters are lgb lets go bandon
nobody wanted to be miss idaho
the crooked man wheres the crooked smile do i need to take any cognitive test
bias interview the interviewers obviously and clearly showing their in favor on biden tr√πmp forever president of united states until he can trump now today future and forever
i thinks you guy have dinosur
can i chat with you here
hello i am here how are you
hes not going to cut social security thats what every democrat says to keep themselves in office
and theres no such thing as climate change
i cant believe your best argument is that biden appears weak and confused stumbling over his words and losing his train of thought in comparison trump is a far superior president he lost the battle within 9 mins of him chatting
the waffle house has found its new host
just imagine if there was a live audience during the debate joe wouldve walked hand waving towards them mid way thru the debate recognising some dead ppl amongst the audience
most stupid are those who will vote trump but i dont mean biden make it michelle obama instead or somebody else that has a good heart
biden resting face is traumatizing
are they the only options available
i feel sorry for biden its sad when people make fun of him hes an old man and needs a retirement i hope usa will have better candidates after 4 years
biden putting up big lies to begin the debate
poor cnn the only time they get ratings is watching the guy theyve been lying about and support for years get absolutely lambasted
oh man with those two options i can only imagine how hard this must be on the voter those parties cant be serious
there were some moments where biden definitely botched some things up however you may say i am in denial but i still will be voting blue because i support biden the democrats and what they stand for and embody if there were another choice perhaps i wouldnt vote blue but truth is i only have two options trump may be more articulate than biden and slightly better at talking but i will not vote for him because i vote based on ideas biden and the dems have better ideas than trump it is a shame to watch two grown old men bicker back and forth and hurl insults
we are cooked
trump tells truth
we were better off with trump before biden injected his corrupt self
just gonna listen to this on the way home and not look at the comments just gonna add that your vote doesnt matter look into divide and conquer strategy ok bye
pfff is it me or trump does not answer straight and clear with proposals and direction to any single question all i hear from him is no data backed up sentences and he just keeps using his time to attack the opponent i mean i am already amazed that someone with criminal harges can be running for president but still if you really are running wouldnt it be wise to make with a worked and defined program
greetings from russia
trump better than joe
exclunde hugary the eu
this is hilarious
im from pakistan but i like trump biden is a criminal because he kill so many inocent peoples in palestine by providing weapon to israel
trump respect button
us has 0 youth politicians
not even half way through this and i throw up when i hear biden
trump in and biden out
the person who came up with subtitles thank you so much
everytime biden opened his mouth i scrolled down to read the comments
me throughout the entire debate everytime the hosts and trump speaks caption off everytime biden opens his mouth increases volume caption on
baiden number one youre the sucker number two youre the loser
god i hope shane gillis is watching this
wealth inqeuity has never been worse middle class with 2 jobs cant afford to own one lousy roof over their head the nation has never been more divided on social and political issues climate change is reaching the point of no return and artificial intelligence is going to destroy whats left of the working class people in a few years and these are the two elderly clowns that run for the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world yeah were screwed
were cooked
donald trump is a habitual liar and project 2025 is to set up a nazi america
my boy biden was legit tweakin at 1200
not the golfing argument on a presidential debate
how can this be valid tho if trump is a registered liar
im 14 whoever gets elected will be my last childhood president
why dont they just answer the questions straight i thought these people are americans
president biden might not be able to have more voice when he speaks in the near future if that is his highest vocal voice
which country does biden think is the greatest economy also biden is president so is he saying he made sure america isnt the greatest economy
4800 is scary they have more lined up to ensure hes going to jail because hes running for president
why cnn didnt insist on the question if they will recognise palestine as a state
can anyone give reasoning with actual facts of why trump iswas a bad president
this is really sad biden is absolutely in no condition to run anything not even today let alone another 4 years almost appears as elder abuse he should be retired to enjoy what time he has left in peace without all this stress and expectations he seems to be forced to follow
trump this war should never been started i would say correct
for those of you reading this comment its okay its normal to feel lonely sometimes if youre going through tough times keep trying but never give up
what a liar joe
black child care cost i didnt realize that was a thing white child care cost mexican child care cost and asian child care cost would sound crazy
democrats now reap the whirl wind
what a joke
groan the childish name calling by biden this is an utter embarrassment the facilitators did a good job
listen to the real debate where robert francis kennedy jr independent candidate for 2024 elections responds to the two who cnn hosted and presents his solutions rfk jnr is the nephew of jf kennedy who was president in the 50s and 60s check out the real debate to see him in the debate alongside trump and biden using the internet tech to skip over cnn and the two parties trying to exclude him smear him and pretend he doesnt exist he was the best debater by far actually having intelligent solutions about the real issues we are facing for example americans have had a 22 percent hike in home insurance and are paying 4 for a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread and 6 for a gallon of gas then he added its because of the forever wars and outofcontrol spending by these two gentlemen this is the reason they need me on stage because i will confront them with what they did see for yourself httpswwwkennedy24comtherealdebate
in all seriousness bidens face shows how really confused and clueless he is as a healthcare provider its easy to call out dementia and cognitive decline just by looking at him
where are the f16s for ukraine where s land lease where s the support of israel baiden totally failed the foreign policy
in france the leftists have won the legislative elections the country is doomed same in uk please usa dont follow the same path
how trump kept a straight face is beyond me i wouldve been on the floor dying laughing
i can count on my hands how many times he blinked
do americans realize this is public
i am middle class dem in office i required 2 jobs to survive rep in office i need 1 job to meet my bills and am afforded a sm savings as well trump 2024
trump got a big mouth biden falls short with him i just wish how it be if obama was in the other side with trump
yall cmon at least biden isnt doesnt try to enforce white male supremacy i know he cant talk super well but trump doesnt gotta be that high school bully to him poor biden
if youre wondering things about joe then go take a gander at proj ect ver it as
you cant print as much money as they have raise taxes force minimum wage increases allow the college loan companies to do what theyre doing and not have economic disaster the dems need to own it
cnn failed in their mission
trump is no better than biden and hes saying hes got all his marbles what a sham
thats f discrimination about all the benefits to black families how about asians hispanic whites families
obama built the cages
this is biden when he loses
democrats governor made sure the c19 as closed for his last few months
afganistan alone is reason biden should not got any votes
guys so now what are we voting for this non blinking puppet or orange trump
i cant understand these pro life people thats the only thing i agree with biden on
i think biden has been on the moon and doesnt know it
thats what you get from a 2party system
thats my joe created chaos and claimed to trump never accepted anything wrong or regretted any mistakes
these two are too old to hold office we need some smart people that are at least in their 60s i know there are some other decent people who can lead the americans lord help our leaders in this country
how tf is he the president hes clearly a puppet
biden will fix the tax issue while making breaks for himself with china money he will lower insulin costs while giving illegals the same insulin for free no cost
still in a police state since 1990 im still for trump even though he is like the little dutch boy biden is ten times worse whats good for thee does not apply to me
120 well they have numbers right at least but the 1 and 2 are out of order
a fact
dear francis faithisists and beliefs love ya
whos the most dishonest biden
omg biden you are embarrassing yourself
trump isnt a politician so he doesnt sugar coat things personally i want to hear where we stand no bs
we have something resembling an automated mop vying for control of our home joe biden has left the building
10644 sharing social security with immigration is the real story
10353 it was trump who brought insulin to 30
trump always turning the blame on somebody else biden is really tired
why does biden have a pen who is he conversing with
biden never fired anyone because they support him cover for him do his bidding and play along with him
trump says something biden hes lying plus fictional material
the last bit trump hit the nail on the head putin didnt take land under trump he took land under bush obama and biden weak men arent feared biden is a weak man
trump is right we pay for the worlds woes we pay for everything when others get to pay nothing or next to nothing
biden couldnt even pronounce the name of one of the main cities in the ukraine war kyiv the capital he must not actually care
biden is a war criminal
from what i seen while trump was president everywhere i looked folks were building and having new and more ways to get money while biden been president i see inflation and illegal immigrants getting everything
glad to see trump will be in the oval office again
dont believe your own eyes
it seem that biden want to put all of the wrong to trumps head
biden choked along with his watching voters
i have a really hard time listening to biden not because what he says more about how he is talking im always afraid hes gonna lose his point and waste my time listening
sorry i just cant vote for any person male or female who cant speak coherent english
number one and number two and number three
they both do not use toilet paper
at 3111 biden said this guy told trump to go ahead and invade ukraine and thats exactly what trump did
breathe joe breathe dont die yet you can kick the bucket after you lose the election
i think mr biden watches his favorite clint eastwood movies on the daily
technically its the 44th and 45th president of the united states still surprises me that the official documents are still wrong on this
biden said around 2615 that he spoke with all those heroes that died at the dday memorial
answer the questions both of you
actually for me i want trump to be president of america
bidens mouth going to fast for his brain biden looks like somebody just stole his puppy biden squeaking again wake up joe biden mumble mumble mumble biden is super generous with my tax dollars all the constitutional lawyers on youtube said the case should never have been brought and after it was brought they all said the case should be dropped and they all said how can you convict someone without a unanimous decision the judge told the jury you dont need a unanimous decision to convict him
this is the best we can do
this lady looks like the joker they wont let donald respond
just got back from being in antarctica for 6 months going to watch hopefully biden beats trump
again wsj your going to not allow my post that they are saying social security may run out of money in 10 years presently 43 states have time limits on welfarega programs you can google this in years past a number of republicans had put time limits also on welfarega benefits people on social security and welfare programs are citiizens too so allow this into this debate president joe biden said in present debate as he is running for president now that a number of republicans want to end social security so very sad indeed childrenfrail elderly disabled blind veterans and spouses are on social security which was put into law by congress in 1935 to keep elderly from starving and not be in need they have constitutional rights as well they are christianly christians too on socialsecurity and welfare programs so have a fear of god and jesus too people need food safe shelter and jobs to live being an honest person i must mention my smart phone is not working right recently i was at retail store because i didnt like my smartphone making my pages disappear if checked out my post and kept it then it was good of you to do so eva l hart may prayerfully jesus help us
biden clutching at every straw in the hay bail its crazy how in an attempt to win a reelection you go after someone personally i thought this was a political debate
its kind of crazy both of them really did not answer any questions they was asked they went around the question instead there was some valid points made but very little
from where this
my health care insurance went up to 120400 a month just for me why to pay for everyone who doesnt have it tell me mr biden why i cant even afford to go to the dr now also ive seen illegals come in to my place of business and the next time i see them they have braces on their teeth and 1 even had a breast addition fjb
loxism the west over will the european spirit claim its independence again stay tuned
this is the moment where im grateful that im not american so that i dont have to choose between these two to lead the country
lets be honest both of these people are completely inadequate to run this country trump will ruin this place for everyone except the elite and biden will do essentially nothing its so joever for america
wes ta bush
biden is a potato i used to think hed be a harmless potato head in the white house but he ended up being a very dangerous person for the country everyone i know is so much worse with biden as a president than ever before vote him out he needs to retire he never did anything productive in his life as a politician
the idea
is trump paying for the democrats to keep joe bidden senile as a discredited candidate
we are so screwed
listening to this like a podcast
biden looks like hes itchy but doesnt know where to scratch
dazed confused lost incoherent scared look sad deal all the way around
and by the wayand by the wayand by the wayheres the dealheres the deal joe biden
all i see is two old men arguing and not making any sense
this debate is ridiculous instead of answering the real questions posed by hosts they just keep on bitching about each other like school girls and hosts never even follow up and return to the actual questions i dont even know if they answered any real questions this is not a presidential debate its not even a debate at all its like a jersey shore reality show
if you take this exact footage and play it in snl with some croud laughter it would be better comedy than dave chapell
trump rules over crooked crazy joe my 1 year old grand kid speaks more fluently than this man thats made a mess of this country
a literal felon vs a literal alzheimers patient you cant make this stuff up what do we do to deserve these candidates
bro biden was spacing out the whole time to be honest trump smoked biden in that debate biden looked really bad
yooo hes talking about fraud during the election yet the courts have thrown all his claims out blatantly lying on camera like that is crazy
i the princess of afghanistan and my both cats with their 5 kittens are laughing and farting to death watching this
trump biden doesnt know the difference between loser and sucker
we are in an episode of black mirror we are not looking good people
if our country is as bad as trump says it is why would ppl be willing to die to get here
the entire world is opposed thee fact of our existence and that is why more males need to consider sterilization procedures before speaking out against supreme court decisions pertaining to roe versus wade
trump selfishness is a poison for this country dont swallow his lying words
if this is the best our nation can come up with we are cooked no matter what side of the aisle you are on
this seems like an event held in a retirment home
biden is not fit to be elected his mental health is deteriorating
left and right wing of the same bird puppet show at its finest
what is the name of this comedy show
in my opinion biden is doing just fine running the country
rfk jr 2024
look at dumbos face
what was that gurgling sound at time stamp 1626 and 1630
10 minutes in djt 2024 lets go brandon
its terrifying hearing the leader of the us acting like noone thinks the us has the greatest economy in the world it does its not perfect but no other economy even comes close chinas does in capacity but theyre still poor on average due to their massive population
kamala is half african american and half indian during the democratic administration many h1b visa it workers especially from india came to the us to work for cheap labor and signed contracts to receive sponsorships for green cards this influx raised concerns about them taking jobs in the information technology sector we need to establish laws requiring companies to prioritize hiring american workers and outsourcing american jobs before employing h1b visa holders for cheaper labor our younger generation is at risk these aggressive indian workers took american jobs and fired older workers with slower performance make america great again hire americans first
biden speaks like i do when i hate someone and want them to go away
kamala is half african american and half indian during the democratic administration many h1b visa it workers especially from india came to the us to work for cheap labor and signed contracts to receive sponsorships for green cards this influx raised concerns about them taking jobs in the information technology sector we need to establish laws requiring companies to prioritize hiring american workers and outsourcing american jobs before employing h1b visa holders for cheaper labor our younger generation is at risk these aggressive indian workers took american jobs and fired older workers with slower performance make america great again hire americans first
im 61 years old and work 28 hrs a wk they took my medicaid and i pay over 170 a month for my medicare and united health care 34 a month without my little caretaker job i could not survive not to mention the copays and deductibles i care for 2 grandkids the government does not give me snap i dont qualify for any assistance being disabled and need to work they act like that little 13 hr is a lot for 3 people to live off of with the rising pricing of food and everything else
biden only needs to rest he is now incalpabale and old its not his fault thats natural especially when you get to such age papa please you have done well but now your mind isnt okey sir kindly rest
trumps brain still works like a young fresh one he can connect the dots in his mind pretty easy he can recall most of the events quickly quite impressive for his age
know that they both work under someone elite
the troubles that trump caused went into affect the last 4 years
biden learned his speech so hard and went so hard at the start to pretend he could speak fast burned him out hes not capable
you can see trump genuinely feels sorry for biden
bursted out laughing when joe said everything we have to deal with uh uhh we finally beat medicare trump well hes right hes beaten medicare to death and that wasnt even what joe biden was gonna say uh covid excuse me everything we have to deal with uh uhforgot what he was saying then joe blurted out we finally beat medicare cuz he thought that would cover up for the fact that he freaking forgot what he was saying
stuttered truth is still truth
the idea the idea the idea
bidens like our previous washing machine it was beyond repair
whos vote for biden helping china and russia to destroying this beautiful country
i totally agree that the other countries has lost a lot of respect due to our leader
i know a lot of people dont like trump and just want anyone but trump in office but if you actually vote for a man that cant even finish his own sentences you are insane and you are the reason for americas downfall i fear america needs a conscious president be serious
biden looked like the tin man from the wizard of oz on his walk to the podium
i need to watch an older debate to remember what there supposed to be like
jake tapping was so delighted for this in his introwas wishing he had worn his dependsdana looks like a sad dog
us teck wes
biden is not equipped to be president would you trust him to protect your family if hamas came in your home hes barely be able to get a gun out let along a word out
trump right now this is a failed nation yes the fact that these two relics are standing here as the prime candidates for president is the proof of this
11027 trump speaks about how to solve the problems biden
i had social security when trump was president i have had a disease since 4 i take care of three babies now theyre handing out social security for freaking anxiety if i had ss under trump how can biden say he got rid of social security
i think many people know it by now the people who are in control are so far from our sight and these are two actors auditioning for the same part do you really think biden was running your country he can barely speak but not just the usa the puppets whom we know as presidents and leaders they do what they told to do patterns are too familiar everywhere i can prove it but you already know it if you dont you never will accepting this matter is not the point thinking is
i love trumps face every time biden answers
its like im watching south park
if anything this is heartbreaking to watch nothing to laugh about
putin wanna take ukraine in 2011 minsk agreament in 20142015 with help of us money was killed 9800 people donetsk odessa etc ukraine closed 85 of water and gaz for krim from 2014 dont paid pension killed 500 childrens angels allee
2024 freakshow
they deliberately set it up for multitudes of people not go to work and get unemployment to make unemployment numbers high and then biden comes in and unemployment ends and people are told to go back to work to make it look like unemployment numbers went down because people got jobs and still unemployment is high and only looks down because many people ran out of unemployment benefits people didnt go back to work like the dems thought they would yet they still trying to act like unemployment is down
the idea
they selling those babies
i guess trump won again
i wish biden to win he is the best president ever dont trouble bots
biden best prrsident for usa start to talk mmmm forgoten what he talk about catastrofa

correct he offered but nancy turned it down
a debate really where what debate there is no debate trump2024
biden cant even keep his diaper clean how can he clean up this country
reagan was in way better shape then biden and stepped down due to his health
as my husband is a veteran i can confirm that he can not stand biden so yes president trump is correct
one thing i can bet on that will happen due to the election the democrats are allowing illiguels to vote in the presidental election i can bet how all these illiguels are treared in democratic states they will now vote for trump and when that happens the dems will say that trump cheated in the presidental election while the democrats are allowing them to vote
i had no problem with my water while trump was president now having to boil and filter the same water i am changing twice a month and when i fill a bottled water today and keep it there and untouched for a week my water now is green

this angers me so much biden is saying that trump is the only one that believes that we had the greatest economy under his presidency i was a lower income lower class if you would like to call it that that because of trump and his policies and because of the economy during his presidency my life had a hopeful and pleasant future ahead of me once he came into office biden stripped me of everything i ever had i lost everything because of his policies i was literally homeless i cant afford to feed my family i have to work three jobs just to make ends meet biden is the worst president i have ever experienced during my lifetime i believe that he is for himself that he is selfish that he is a scared wussy baby that he is incompetent and that he needs to go i want trump back because my life was awesome when he was president and im coming from the lower end of society that had a chance to make it in this world because of biden im hopeless bring trump back
unbelievable these are real presidential candidates and even were presidents the us is such a joke of a country lol
delusional vs very old
the border patrol is not on bidens side i seen plenty of of videos that border patrol who complained that they work double time and is against the open border
so biden is all about the abortion between the woman and the state than he said that politics should not be in this situation and you are all for the state s to abort that does not make sense
if rfk jr doesnt win the elections im afraid of whats going to happen to the world
one thing i learned is that 2 minutes is not enough to talk
why is he debating 2 people and not joe biden why doesnt biden get any follow up questions fn joke trump still wiped the floor with them
biden cant count jobs for americans if it illiguels are getting these jobs and you cant count bounce back jobs and you cant count jobs after he lost 3 tomes more jobs before he gave them back to the illiguels
he beat medicare
yall if theres a minimum age there needs to be a maximum age like 7075
love how they start arguing golf
there is no such thing as american democracy that word in not in our constitution we are a constitutional republic
for a country to have these 2 plonkers as their only choice and be torn between choosing one of these two it must be a backward worth nothing entity
just because something was a law for 51 years doesnt make it just dont forget what we fought about during the civil war that was legal at the time
climate change is a joke just like the two party system the left wing and right wing are on the same bird

please address president trump as president trump you may refer to him as former but it is incorrect to use it when addressing him why dont you know this no harm done but lets please not erode etiquette even further than it has suffered here
anyone that cares for this president needs to let him spend the last days he could possibly enjoy in peace his wife is truly abusive you can see the fear in his eyes i despise the thought of trump but cant vote for a man incapable of simple sentences
trump wins

imagine trump realizing that theres no need to be a loud mouth bully
we are trump fans all the way
first of allas a chinese i respect all americans though we are opponents for each other furthermorei still recall the presidential election result had been declared clearly on that morning four years agoi relived stress after knowing the news thirdlyi have learned a lot from this debateespecially the spiritual strength which exploded from this fierce debate even though the two characters are nearly 80 years oldthere is no reason a young man like me should complain that life is hard finallyi predict trump will win the election even though i didnt like him beforeim very impressed by his logical thinkingmore fluent expressions and healthier shapebest wishes to him
he must have said the idea at least 50 times
the trump presidency was making america stronger jobs and economy were steadily improving for the first three years he did have a tendency to say whatever was on his mind when he shouldnt have spoke so impulsively but even his ridiculous comments werent as embarrassing to this country has the things biden says we didnt look weak in the eyes of the world like we do now and trump certainly didnt even come close to running up the deficit spending that the current administration has covid crashed the economy here just as it did in countries all across the world the over the top scare tactics and ridiculous mandates with the closures of businesses shut our economy down not trump
trump seems the candidate in this debate
battle of brains programs plans abd achievements
you better shut up about agent orange and insurance for our veterans
you biden you are as guilty as netanyahu though 23 americans also said this
president accusing president to win an election
its over we are done
biden no go no more in this planet
the idea is biden said
biden is not fit to run a big country like usa
trump is telling the truth
as a swede i must say our country is in a really bad state right now but at least we dont have a senile leader lol
swedish person here why can a convict run for president in the us
americans cry while watching this foreigners laugh while watching this
this feels like 2 middle schoolers suddenly aged 70 years edit the replies are pro trump and i live in the uk so all ive heard about both ppl is bad tbh hope yall get someone good
this large country has just 2 guys capable of being a candidate for the presidency
both of them are too old and they should not greedy
why arent they seated why standing up for nearly 2 hours its exhausting for any mans age
biden looks like a zombie and at the end of his life
ugh excuse me cnn where is the rest of americans choices like rfk jr or anyone else besides these two death traps
3655 biden he is the one who wants to get out of the nato do you want to get out of the nato trump
trump anything biden the idea the idea
biden was getting on personality and insults because of the weakness it is inappropriate behavior of president
truld my dedno truld frintwho look
i cant tell if trump has gotten a good tan or got burnt
if trump had the presidency right now he would pretend things are so great even if we nothing change
can someone explain to me why can we hear biden speaking on the way to a mic but we cant hear trump
man these comments are killing me
theres a sound of a shart at 11625
just watching the first 5 minutes has boosted my vote trumptrain 2024 just as my vote has been in the past god bless america and god bless president trump
trump used to be bidens worst nightmare now biden is bidens worst nightmare the best part is trump knows this
biden will be a disaster and trump will win easily this gentleman doesnt do it how did it get to this point
this is absolute cinema ordered no arguments do more of this
trump conveniently evades the question and takes the debate to another direction
gosh i dont understand 50 words biden says and this is the person who has his finger on button the guy who can launch warheads when he cannot pronounce a single word without effort greatest country in the world has this leader no comment did b just said sucker looser look at that expression he looked like de niro as al capone and this is president what culture he represent this explains everything
with the covid i skibid with uh 1203
from jersey to upstate ny i never seen so many
very biased media cnn theyre censoring many comments
218 looks like hes going to hit the floor any moment
honestly i wonder how this great america letting biden as president
i think trumb is the best to be leader
the world trembles
4643 someone speaking into his ear and it was heard by the mic
the more i watched and paid enough attention to this debate as a zimbabwean i have just come to realize that im more of a democrat i realized that democrats will never watch anything considered wrong and harmful and do nothing about it america you are that father who was given a duty to look after the entire family unfortunately you made so many mistakes that you need to try and fix all you need to do is find better and peaceful ways to fix the broken pieces of your family this world needs peace and safety for all nothing as
democrat shame usa obamabiden hilary destroy usa davosbilderberg
as someone who lives in the us this is pure entertainment were so cooked
european here biden keeps saying were gonna do this that so what has he been doing
the way trump looks at joe when he gets to making no sense 1157
presidential debate summed up trump calling biden the worst president in the history of the united states and biden saying everything he said was a lie my grocery bill at least doubled in the past 4 years and my taxes went through the roof im not a millionaire by any stretch of the imagination i do see illegal immigrants being dropped off at my small town train station because chicago refuses to take anyone else whos that helping dropping a bunch of folks who dont have money family or any resources off at a train station in the middle of no where with a train ticket going somewhere else i feel sorry for these folks they aint got nothing and have been promised the world and get dumped off to fend for themselves why bring them in
praying for united states hope they get a great president in the future
president trump you was the caused for the growing of the pandemic
we seem to be living in gotham city were no rules apply what will this new generation do this is a wake up call because it will happen again the system has to be overhauled sane laws dont allow a traitorfelon to run for president the vice president should be chosen by us this one is not fit they usually arent there should be an age limit for presidents im an old geezer and its just common sense at least biden will have people to guide him trump will just have other criminals saying yes boss the joker is of course unacceptable in any circumstance he is a fascist and dangerous the fighting between each other has been ignited intentionally we waste our time pointing fingers and calling names meanwhile the powers that be handle us as puppets so to the younger generation create a better model you deserve better
we laughed a lot
let trump win and by the other beside all disgusting thing its just embarrassing just look at him
im a foreigner i think this is muppet show
jill telling him you answered all the questions joey was how you talk to your 5 year old
comedy gold biden is a stand up comedianhe looks like he needed lots of rest in a nursing home
the current president of the united states is a clown on world stage
interesting election for usa citizen to choose their leader trump looks sharp and energetic while biden the opposite anyway the world is so interrelated right now its not easy to be a president and every decision will have consequences
astonished by the very first reply of mr biden accused mr trump and covid19 to the simple of question of hike in rates of grocery 120
according to surveys the highest trust scores for va outpatient care reached nearly 92 under president joe bidens administration while the highest approval rating during donald trumps tenure was around 90 both figures represent significant peaks in veteran satisfaction with the va
oh yeah and biden what happened to the 200 boost to social security checks
the idea said a billion times
america has to chose between these two god bless america
do all you mocking president biden realize how much facts and statistics he made during the debate from a totally neutral point of view how would someone vote for this delussional egomaniac instead just cuz of the fact that joe is old youre not voting for just one person even if something would happen to the president you still have people under him working with the same principles and share beliefs
biden s hands his whole confusion hes just not capable who is running our country

kennedy is the remedy
donny is the man
this was hard to watch biden was clearly sick and that made it very hard to debate he should have rescheduled donny wouldnt stop lying 99 of what he said was a flat out lie where were the fact checkers donny had a stupid smirk on his face the whole time oh and i love that donny aced his two cognitive tests genius make lying wrong again
i feel sorry and embarrassed for americans to let this happen a dementia old guy to be the president dont they realized that bidens been a real joke to the whole world for years from nz
yep our country is in danger
biden screwing the working class get him out
its like another dumb and dumber sequel d
ukraine finish
trump sucks on abortion but won in most areas of the debate i dislike them both
trumps right biden has destroyed this country we need trump back
joe biden showing some serious mental problems bro cant even put together 1 word
we have over three hundred million americans and these two are the best we can get
after this i am very surprised how the usa is one of the most powerful countries
when is the next one that was hilarious the dementiacrats are ridiculous
if the democratic party sees trump as a menace they should be ashamed of themselves for running biden
the comments here are awesome
i havent laughed like that in a while
it always starts with trump then brandon responds trump again but biden almost always gets to get the last word
i can see a civil war if trump doesnt win lol
biden literally go on full mode sleep again
presidential debate comedy show
what a complete and unmitigated disaster
i commend biden for not pooping his pause and remaining alert and coherent for in his case guiness world record 60 minutes straight
if you dont want to vote for biden because of his age just imagine hes a zombie a zombie presidentnow thats pretty frigging cool
cnn sucks and is a terrible news agency trying to monopolize the airing of the presidential debate with bribes and threats i spit on the trepidation you spill on to society
we either get the emperor or hmm darn it i hate making jokes about presidents but this is terrifying these men we will have to count on one of them and the only one we can really count on is the one wholl never leave
the best president trump in the world
why a coin toss dont they know who is left and right
in case you dont know it is customary to call any man who has been elected president of the united states is to be forever referred to and addressed as president president donald trump is my president and i would appreciate if that tradition is respected thank you
1157 we finally beat medicare
biden is like manmohan singh i dont know what they did in their past career but as president prime minister they were just puppets of their parties
if you put the speed on 125 biden almost speaks normal
the richclimate lies is all biden knows now lol
trump has already fooled the american people once and the united states cannot afford to have trump come back for another four years although biden seems a little slow to respond he is clearly a better politician
every time biden says the idea i get the nick fury feel
it isnt a sin to become older and not be as sharp as one once was biden is showing obvious signs of aging losing his train of thought stumbling and looking confused and lost etc that happens to all of us but he is the leader of our country we cant afford to have a person leading our country that is suffering with a mental decline occurring i have no respect for jill biden who would insist that hes fit to serve if she loves him she should do the right thing which would be to encourage him to hand over the torch everyone including other leaders can see for themselves i will admit the choice we have is tough but biden is struggling more and more its like he is trying to prove something he needs to step down while he still has respect from the people
my friend and i did a drinking game to this only with hot sauce alcohol would have killed us couldnt even finish halfway because our stomach linings said no

its so wonderful
this just shows we need to update the out look in america everyone old
anyone wanting to live in usa should wait until trump wins
i wonder if the cnn dress staff purposely screwed up trumps tie and made bidens neat
the saddest part about this debate is that even after watching biden ramble incoherently someone out there will still vote for biden
trump button
i lost so many ppl
america is hilarious
anyone else watch barack obiden get hooked on phonics during the debate its not fair to call that a debate really obviously el presidente has yet to master the developing of thoughtsopinions into words i dont want to say i told you so but i suppose i just did i couldnt resist after watching that abysmal performance these folks will outright accuse anyone not lining up with the agenda of some
this is not a debate it is my command your king has spoken time is all humanity has now oh also its a nice sunny dat outside my window in thailan with al my thai gods
biden is finally out in public after staying in the white house basement since he won the general election
the way this debate was set up was just weird we never got a town hall debate between biden and trump and thats what i want to see
as an indian watching this debate this is pure entertainment not gonna lie
you got the morals of a alley cat sleepy joe came with some heat
i realized that the secret to making a million is saving for better investment i always tell myself you dont that new maserati or that vacation just yet that mindset helped me make more money investing for example last year i invested 80k in stocks and made about 246k but guess what i put it all back and traded again and now i am rounding up close to a million
you guys are insane the nuclear war is coming if trump doesnt do anything and you think you dont know whom to vote
trump 2024 it was so hard to stay awake when joe was talking i could not understand his mumbuling
im thinking of the amount security thats outside
bob hope and his brother no hope at all
does america not have any eligible candidates besides these two clowns
when you discover that your opponent destroys himself you dont lift a finger
biden talking about cutting taxes i think youve already had a chance to do so then the blame game never answer the question
the video is good
no data hey cmon over well house ya feed ya and give ya money insurance schooling etc but screw our veterans that are homeless and on the streets while the undocumented are put up in 5 star hotels makes me sick 2310
biden keeps saying trump only helped the rich im pretty sure i had more money than i ever had in my life under trump and ive never left the poverty line gas food housingeverything was cheaper if thats helping the rich then keep doing it
inflation has doubled where has biden been
when youre unhappy come read the comments then cant stop laughing happy again
why do they keep cutting joe off when he starts going off script almost like they were told cut him off before he looks like a fool too late
why does the doctor have to be a him joe 1632
im literally having to switch between this and the why files so i can recuperate brain power i cant believe im watching them argue about golf rn
trump is back
groceries that cost 100 now cost 250 i dont know where 120 came from
we are screwed
10034 his face is just so
we should be focusing on the world we have bridges being tore down terrorists entering the us immigrants entering the us we are in chaos living history right now thanks to biden he is behind the issue by letting immigrants in an helping them and not our own people on the streets how is that gonna make change the world needs peace war thats the only way to make peace at this point its gone too bad us is not america anymore thats done for we are a any mans land any race is allowed with or without legal documentsagain thanks to biden trump is the only one too make change do the country right for u and your children vote for biden youl witness ww3 trump can prevent that
the golf challenge sent me
biden did not do as bad as people say he didhowever trump is my pick this november 2024
has biden given the questions and answers because he keeps looking to his notes in advance of his question
close the border and you wont have much to do
i am hearing backlash from this comment black jobs it is exactly what they began saying trump just didnt call it unemployment he called it jobs there was no racism there wow those dems took the ball and ran with that one which brings to mind matthew 1022 and you will be hated by all for my names sake john 1518 if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you do you see how much they hate trump you should be smart enough to know why i hope people get the eyes to see and ears to hear before it is too late our nation is being destroyed more and more every day pray for trump
if blaks and whites are equal why would a black person get 10k to buy their first home but not a white person
bottom line listening to joe and listening to trump which one has actually reduce positive results joe is so pathetic he doesnt realize that he has created the chaos thats being discussed in this farce of a debate
whatever biden states is the total opposite
we support trump from brazil people good
joe biden went to the grand wizards funeral while he was vice president under odama figure it awt folks
no president has ever spoken like that before 4635 nope biden is the first to stumble that much
trump won this debate hands down
i am a vietnam veteran and i can tell you everything joe biden is saying about veterans is a bald face lie the va has never been worse in the history of america i didnt spend 20 years in the navy and leave my blood on the ground in vietnam for nothing joe biden is the biggest the most terrifying enemy of the military active or retired when i heard him talking about the military i can hardly keep my lunch down
because you guys left the comments open ill subscribe to the channel for now

as a small business owner the economy was great while trump managed it it helped the business i dont know where biden is getting the money for all these projects raise taxes that wont help
i really cant stand that when 9 times out of 10 when they get asked a question they argue about something completely diffrent what a mess modern politics are

the longest 9 seconds of jb career before he uttered we finally beat medicare ouch
this debate is highly though
what is happening
donald j trump 2024 make america great again
hitler and trump similarities use of propaganda hitler utilized propaganda extensively to spread nazi ideology control public perception and demonize opponents joseph goebbels his minister of propaganda played a key role in this trump frequently used social media and rallies to communicate directly with his base often bypassing traditional media he also labeled mainstream media as fake news to undermine their credibility populist rhetoric hitler promoted a nationalist agenda blaming jews and other minorities for germanys problems and promising to restore germany to its former glory trump used populist themes emphasizing america first and often blamed immigrants foreign nations and political elites for americas issues charismatic leadership hitler cultivated a strong authoritative image presenting himself as the savior of germany trump presented himself as a strong leader who could fix the countrys problems often portraying himself as an outsider fighting against a corrupt establishment scapegoating hitler blamed jews communists and other groups for germanys economic and social woes leading to severe persecution trump frequently blamed immigrants particularly from mexico and muslimmajority countries as well as political opponents for various issues facing the united states rallying support through mass gatherings hitler organized large rallies such as those in nuremberg to energize his supporters and project power trump held frequent rallies across the country to maintain enthusiasm among his base and project strength disdain for democratic norms hitler exploited the weaknesses of the weimar republics democratic system to gain power and ultimately dismantle it trump criticized various democratic institutions and norms including questioning the legitimacy of elections and the integrity of the judicial system
biden and his administration is pure evil they should all be locked up pathetic
most of this debate was a yap session biden lost this yap session big time
fired
biden administration is pathetix did not make any of the peoples lives better everything got screwed up in terms of cost rent up gas up groceries up insurance up child expense up
why did she ask the president if he could block abortion thats not even something the president f deals with what the f is wrong with these people
its moronic for biden to compare legislation to actual results he thinks creation of laws is an achievemrnt biden does not understand results
you hate people who enter the us illegally but how did we kill and abandon native americans 600 years ago and take their land i see that america is not just for americans this is illiberal behavior trump
biden has destroyed america and lady liberty is at her knees america cant afford 4 more years of biden he should be charged with treason there is no good policy from biden
how many times was the phrase the idea said
our country has become a joke and i wish i was born in a different generation
if the boarders were closed like they are supposed to bewe wouldnt need machines joe
communism is a better option than any one of these two trump is a complete and utter child and biden is just putting so much effort into just standing
i will not vote for anyonethis is shameful
trump doesnt care about facts he just says what sounds good for his image and knows his supporters wont care if hes incorrect
100 to 120 nice try more like 100 to 300
my goodness biden is a habitual liarover and over hes done nothing for the american people and everything for the illegalsyep i said it
close your mouth joe and wink your eyes im kind of worried your pupils are dilated
oh and by the way the idea first off number 1 the idea that we and by the way number 2 the idea that americans whduawdwanyway number 3 the idea that oh and by the way the idea that uh we beat medicare
this man just called him brandon
biden complains about billionaires only paying 8 in taxes or whatever garbage hes trying to say well he had 40 to fix that as senator and now president but no lets blame trump ridiculous
you should have not opened the boarder biden in the first place so there will be no drugs coming in
i cant watch it i cant stand that every time biden opens his mouth lies come out
we have proved 4 times the 2020 presidential election was stolen at least watch 2000 mules
he didnt rally supporters on jan 6
stupid arguing about golf all trump has to do is play golf with biden it would be the laugh of the century
bidens on a whole other planet
top
my electric bill went from 150 to 500five hundred not sure whos fault it is but its out of hand regardless
im edging on that
he was the 1st to not yake a salary
we are a dv family of 5 one going to college we lived better when trump was in office yes i live in texas but my family is struggling almost to point we will loose are home of 12yrs
climate corenew world order
looking back at this on july 6th the fallout from bidens performance is still a top subject on the news damage control and panic from democrats lots of new voters for donald trump dr phil asked biden hows it workin fer ya
atp im not seeing any reasons to vote democrat yet
everyday im calling ted cruz office and telling them to impeach mf betrayed the country and everybody jus cool w it
this is sad to watch joe looks tired
regret my late opinion pres biden had not been unsteady during the debate the problem is that he stutters everybody knows that he is not the only one with that impediment he has done a wonderful job so far and should be given the opportunity to continue
bruh they talking about absolutely nothing we doomed either way im not voting for
what joe grandpa is saying i can bearly hear and understand
i feel so bad for the moderator this is embarrassing
we need a secure wall
looking for a biden supporters comment cant find one
i wont say that then proceeds to say it again trump
the idea that
whoever votes for biden after this should leave the country and never come back
american presidents of the earliest eras turning and hissing in their graves
he skipped over the part where immigrants are staying in luxury hotels while the working class work 7 days a week and get paid for 3
wow people are still going to vote for biden
trump needs to be president for 20yrs after this
groceries went from 100 to 120 more like 220 houses up 30 more like 130 dumb on
1828 trumps random nonsense about after birth abortions lol right after he drifts off into answering a bunch of questions that were not asked
trump is right democrat party administration govt lack of respect and governance caused all the wars today wake up america maybe democratic party wants us in ww3
so love this debate but so do china russia korea iraq thats the worry
his finger droops when he points at trump lol
oh and by the way
the people who actually run the world must be having an absolute field day
fjb is ev1l period
this is the best standup comedy in 2024
1153 with the covid skibidi with
shame to cnn with those moderators
i didnt know trump is such a great speaker seems like the media only gives us edited scripts but this one is as is
biden looks so pathetic staring off into space with his mouth wide opened looking at the floor like a child when trump is talking about how terrible he is this man is the epitome of weakness
we knock on wood wherever we may have wood instant classic best president of my lifetime
biden is such a liar
trump figh
welcome the candidates for the most powerful job in the world vs
trump for the win im over biden he looks confused and thinks its the year of 2020
most respected country in the world sums up the idiocy and lack of comprehension really
3028 bidennever heard so much malarkey in my life literally everyone trying to listen to what biden is mumbling we agree
these two trump or biden do not deserve to be at the top of the american politics or sit in the highest chair
i am not even an american but i just cannot stop laughing when watching the debate masterpiece defintely
im from the uk we lost respect for america when you elected trump
this match the clear winner is donald trumpet
i thought i had left a comment
both the presidents are over the hill and the us needs a younger leader with new ideashaley berry would have been a better choice
the fact that the comments are not locked is amazing all of the obama endorsement adds have comments turned off
free_free_palestine
is this real
everything got expensive once joe got in now he wants let back in so he lies like we dont live here
what a circus this two individuals have created at least one presidential candidate is still in full control of his mental abilities the other is mentally gone i wonder what the rest of the world think of this great country sad
biden needs to stay home in his pyjamasread the paper and do normal things that grand dads do at his agehe is past his primeamericans deserve better
thats a lie biden my father had everything he needed by the va in trump 4 yrs until biden was elected my father was retired veteran army so yes biden you did cute back on the va care known fact and living spouse my mother that was married to the veteran
im starting to think to many ideas are being had
so what did we finally decide on the golf portion of the debate
if trump doesnt win the elections a civil war will happen in america
i like the ad pauses joe has that open mouth and thousand yard stare hes known for
question 1 of the debate was about inflation the very first words out of bidens mouth were lies 1 well you got to take a look at what i was left when i became president what mr trump left me fake the condition of the economy was not due to trump but due to the pandemic and due to governors who mandated the closing of businesses in their states he was not responsible for that condition other than to say it would have been worse had he not done the things he did what mr trump left me suggests that what was left was of his doing and it absolutely was not 2 we had an economy that was in free fall lie people were starting to get vaccines in december and things were already rapidly returning to normal by late january things werent falling they were rising 3 the pandemic was so badly handled many people were dying and all he said was its not that serious just inject a little bleach into your arm youll be alright objectivelylie lie lie a the pandemic wasnt mishandled they did try their best supplying the cdc with the resources to do its work doctors not politicians lead the response if social distancing and masking were not effective i wouldnt blame the administration or even the medical scientists who were limited in what could be done there was no great silver bullet they missed a great and effective grand thing that would make all the difference it was small things that had small impacts b many people were dying thats true but anything that comes after the statement of all he said would be a deliberate misrepresentation unless it contained all of what he said c the statement he attributed to him was nothing even remotely close to what he said and it wasnt even based on something he said it was based on a question he asked someone while not addressing the press something he found interesting that statement was a complete lie and deliberately misleading anyone who heard it trump never even used the word bleach he did use the word disinfectant a person with a virus is infected to disinfect a person infected with a virus is to inject an antiviral medication a virus killer antivirus is a disinfectant because it comes in contact with a virus and the virus dies antibodies attack infections the therapy monoclonal antibodies used man made proteins that acted like antibodies in that they bound to the virus and destroyed it as they disinfected an infected person and it was an iv injection they actually did inject people with a type of disinfectant 4 the economy collapsed there were no jobs absolutely false businesses couldnt hire because no one wanted to work businesses had to struggle to get staff to return as he was taking office tons of jobs no people 5 the unemployment rate rose to 15 lie he asked us to look at what he left us joe took office late january of 2021 did he not the month of january 2021 had a 63 unemployment rate and was coming down nearly half a percent 4 not as bad as joe states it and improving the rebound had begun the difference between 63 and 15 is huge double the 63 to 126 and you are still way off by thousands and thousands if you wanna say he wanted to say thats how bad it once was he should also give trump credit for getting it from 15 down to 63 but as you listen the intent was to make biden look like he was the one that conquered the 15 unemployment obstacle no he spent trillions taking us from 63 to around 4 his goal was to make his achievement look better than it was next was some pointless words with no claims 6 we created 15000 new jobs i put that face because of his next statement we brought out ahem in a position where we have 800000 new manufacturing jobs false this cant be accurate if you have 800000 new manufacturing jobs how can you have only created 15000 jobs which one is false because we arent that bad at math that we cant see one or both are fake numbers you cant call it truth ps giving government contracts from money the government doesnt have and thus spending tomorrows money now is robbing future tax collections that enlarges the money supply thats how you caused the inflation he actually gave one of the answers to thr question here we created jobs with government money its the people who took these jobs and spent their paychecks buying stuff that caused inflation good luck in getting him to acknowledge they over stimulated the economy and that did it hes probably not smart enough to know that
trump didnt win biden simply lost the debate trumps lies could have been beaten
biden you lie everyone knows
if he say the idea one more time
great start for our great trump to finally return to office and repair all the damage biden has done
joe biden is the real life michael scott from scranton
as a foreigner this is insane vs nonsane
its almost set up like a wwe match its just old tired wrestlers not even fighting but stupidly smacking at each other while gloating and saying im the best wrestler look at my fans look at my success this guy sucks while the referees just try to get them to actually wrestle it just makes me sad idec anymore politics are just trash in america
no one believes biden anymore about what experts say as we know he he lied about hunters laptop
cnn is still favorably to biden they let biden have the last talk
in starting of debate it seems like biden had mugged up his answers like a nerdy kid before an school debate competition
i swear reading the comments is more amusing than i found the debate to bethese two old guysgive em a fishing pole and a boatitll make for great comedy
last one was so bad they gave them a mute button and a warning
even america first people are pro destroying america in favor of israel
where do you go to research a presidential candidates campaigning policies im not entirely sure if that sentence was said correctly but i would like to dig a little more into these candidates other than their surface level arguments in order to make a logical and educated vote on who i want to run the country where can i find informarion about their with lack of better words pushing policies or campaigning policies also are these sources reputable i appreciate your responses
debate in jewish cnn vote for putin for us president
even if biden manages to say a few words that makes sense he says something bad about himself
120 dollars for grocery buddy what i literally used to fill up an entire cart with just 100 dollars now if i want to fill up the cart id have to pay 300 dollars plus
i dont have to apologize to you for anything bro id vote for a 12 yr old before that guy
i feel like this is the white version of drake and kendricks beef except they dont know how to diss each other
did biden just say asian orange i cant understand what hes saying but uhhh
seeing this i feel embarrassed on behalf of joe biden
you cannot tell me if biden wins that fraud isnt involved at this point
moderator is lying i used to buy chicken legs at 99c a pound now theyre 20 for only a measly few pounds we cant even afford chicken breast because it was 25 for only a small pack at costco it used to be 5 a poundeven 2lb if you had a fareway costco is known for giving big packs of stuff that pack of chicken was tiny
my grocery bill doubled in the last 4 years
the fact that he comes from scranton and this is not an episode of the oval office is insane right now go back to working at dunder mifflin paper co u aint cut out for this
i used to buy gluten free bread from walmart for 499 i just bought it for 7 yesterday8 with tax and it was so small that i thought my sister had eaten some of it she said no and when i got another bag it was just like that
hes a disgrace to america
biden sucks why vote for him
biden sucks why vote for him
guysplease be more broad minded when i watched this debate i saw the energy of trumpbut his speech was full of populism and surface even if biden had given the worst speech everhe was very accurate and tried to answer to all of the questions carefully thats why before all of you will hate and bully him please think about itfor example if i could i voted for himbut i am a teenager thats why cant do itbut you guys can thats why think before you will make a right decision
the battle of the weak
is it already too late for the party to replace president joe biden he has played hi part in the first term his age is not on his side
do america mean nobody is better than biden or what
trump is good on microphone under him i had respect for america but under biden i lost that respect because i dont see any reason why they keep pumping ammunition into ukraine instead of dialogue between the two countries to find solution and avoid that war it could be avoided and thousands of lives would have been saved today
bidens face is pretty tellingyikes
trump is hero
two old guys crapping on each other
all we need now is a bag of popcorn
2133 trump i really dont know what he said in the end of this biden face expression
one candidate is wants to finish his degree in how to be a dictator in four easy years the other will need to find funding for a convalescence center attached to the oval office omg
bidens face makes me feel uncomfortable
biden claims other countries will fall if russia wins ukraine its called the now disproven domino theory kennedy believed it would happen if s vietnam became communist there was no domino effect after we pulled out we were in vietnam for 20 years and 58220 us military died
i love trump 2025 all the way
this was too obvious
is trump going to ever answer any of the questions asked hes awful
blew up in cnn face lol
i watched the debate between donald trumpbiden but i have some suspicious about control of the loud speaker who controls it why was it very loud when trump speaks and very fanty when biden speaking age is a number based on donald trumps records and what he said he will do if elected a senceable citizens must be scared of him dont elect or vote for him
worst president telling each other
trump did awful he did not once answer the questions asked also what is a black job
an ai running in a quantum computer will run as president in the near future now the good thing about biden winning is his vice
out of over 300 million americans these two are the only options to run this great nation like seriously its so sad to see these clowns when will we get a leader who wants to lead america not israel not china and definitely not big pharma
lets go brandon
covid 19 hurt the economy shut down no jobs no income the economy business was hurt we as americans hurt as result when economy restarted of course inflation happens to reboot economy job rebooted as normal thank god for getting back to normal we give the government to much credit for change or lack of yet we dont trust them but expect them to help us when we down yet some people havent made personal changes to help themselves pick ur battles the middle remain in the middle maintaining always takes care of each other trump is before and mid covid and biden is post covid measure the change and focus of the next 4yrs realistic change over depending on the wealthy to bail is out we are the bail out who will make the rich pay
biden as the daughter of a combat vet who died from burn pit cancer from cam ranh bay vietnam sister of a combat vet in afghanistan and a retired navy vet i can assure you the military hates you and what your administration did to the military
trump said 28 lies i think biden topped that one but trumps are lies bidens are mis speaks
only thing joe cares about is taxes its all tax and spend tax and spend
11625 i swear trump farted or something anybody else hear it
i hate cnn and i am frustrated that cnn was used for this debate cnn is full of liars and antiamerican people they have no ability to run an honest foot race let alone a very serious debate
im voting for the felon
biden really got some problems and he has the nuclear button
trump making contradictory statements about abortion and biden mumbling looking half deadare there no better options
why is biden reading from papers i thought no notes were allowed
biden is thinking man whoever this guy is he should be running for president the way hes staring at trump while he answers his questions
is it just me or is trump wearing e toup√©
biden certainly looked old and weak but his speech was solid
2300 millions of trumps undocumented immigrants are native americans who have lived in what is currently the united states for many thousands of years before trump was born his plan is not deportation a lot of it is genocide and forced expatriation
trump please comeback to white house
debate had 2 e attendee wow january riot my staff no called to be in dc achievehids
this is peak america the entrance alone is gold 214
triumph is going to be reelected if americans have sense
the real reason why he lost was mentioned 2 mins into the debate pre written notes props contact with campaign staff are not permitted the mans a puppet not an intellectual
i thought learning something through this political debate instead laughed to death politicians are politicians and are same everywhere
i wish trump had said more about his tax cuts cutting everyones taxes it raised standard deductions which puts one in a lower bracket lower tax brackets pay lower taxes child tax credits
yooo this debate is fireee put it out
good entertainment feels like something out of a daily soap
trump is right biden doesnt even know what hes saying hes all just stuttering
the idea
number one the idea number two the idea
is usa lack of capable candidates to president
this is your model of democracy choosing between these two ill pass
why is this the only people america can put trust in they both kinda look ridiculous
canada needs trump to win the presidential election in the usa
democrats forever
this debate made trump actually look likable and biden look like he had a stroke most of what biden said didnt even make sense
its wild biden wants to tax the top rich you cant just peoples money away like that they worked for that moneylife
lol biden said the unemployment rate was 50 under trump and inflation was 0 because no one was working thats plain wrong and makes no sense inflation is purely and only from too much currency in a market it has nothing to do with jobs
number 1 i think biden has big problem staying longer than 15 minutes number 2 to participate in debate is a big physical challenge to him number 3 what drives biden in politics is possibility to lie with no legal consequence
this is the man dealing with putin xi and mbs yeah
so basically were doomed
biden should have retired with dignity 4 years ago i hope they just let him go now pathetic
no biden obama separated familys and children not trump
the us literally has the greatest economy in the world texass gdp is higher than all of russias
trump couldnt be more right
biden seems the same in this debate as he is in all other interview and speeches its crazy that the next interview he said he had a bad day because his team and nancy said it he had to stand behind it smh god bless us
shame on biden and his team
im a waitress in canada at a diner most of my customers are seniors i see alot of talk on us news about bidens age being a problem but age is not the problem however if a president has dementia then this is a big problem theres many of my senior customers who are very intelligent people i guess i worry that people will get biased towards older people
whos here not an american
why was there so much digression on the child care and addiction questions
i thought it was so great biden thanked the audience in the studio first lol
inflation brings it from 100 to 120 corporate price gouging is whats bringing it much further up
100 cart of groceries now cost 120 try over 250 where did they get that bs from
yes trump we did a great job thats why our public debt is so high good job equals high debt
trump was speaking facts once again stop letting media manipulate you this is like hip hop vs mumble rap
our choices for president in 2024 1 a disrespectful old man that fuels hate and division 2 an old man that has no idea where hes at
what about child care if neither of them have a solution for this then im not voting
the truth is you dont even have to watch the debate to make a decision this is the first time in american history where a debate is irrelevant even joes own party knows he can not continue to serve as president and nobody wants him americans dont want him
that guy dont even blink
did anyone notice danas eyes at trump at 245 check it out and reply what you think
trump is a liar
biden needs to win to save are country
why are we still letting old folks lead us joe looks like hes about to have a seizure every time donald speaks were the reason why well never see progress in any country none of these presidents can ever account for their actions in 30 years how can we expect anything from people who are about to kick the bucket bonkers they busy trynna make sure their bucket list well stock before its off wild
this is thew worst haha
what is going on is there no speech class of any kind pronunciation spelling youre telling me there was no vocal training done for biden at all intonation vowel
so this is how our generation shutting down the greatest country in whole history by watching two grandpa chatting nonsenses
these comments tell the truth if biden wins something really isnt right
and by the way
i love trump but what is a black job stockbroker lawyer i dont get it
hes a lie
biden was a fool to debate without fact checkers as trump makes up lies on the fly
every decision biden makes is to our detriment he is chinas puppet paid for
i couldnt understand a word joe said during the entire time
i have the walmart app for my kids i have all my order history which i usually click order again it shows the total amount you paid for the previous orders anyway the same order from when we had trump was almost 250 that same order is 550 so its gone up more than 20 with bidenomics thats all i gotta say about that
biden stole the election
to quote hillary clinton what difference at this point does it make
this is really selfish of joe biden to run for elections he definitely wont win why not take a step back so that a more promising candidate can represent the democrats
we are by far in worse shape than when mr trump was in office biden repeatedly lied during the entire debate if biden wins this time it will be obvious that it was by cheating period
this video needs a fact checker
idiocracy was a prophecy
they shouldnt have let dana loach around she isnt like this normally but she knows what she is doing
its crazy to see cnn host the roast the joe biden and then for him to do impersonations of bush and christopher walken
dj trump is cracked im thinking 1000 years
it feels more like a battle between two grandpas than an presidential debate i hope for all americans good luck
after watching bidin the last 4 years i am inclined to believe that he was in decline menaly when he was running he never got out and campaigned he stayed in his basement i remember thinking back then that i have never seen an election where you never saw a politician running for office out in the publics eye as much as joe was
america is cooked
trump evaded the question on immigration can someone remind him please
5000 he ran because him and his wife have been planning on this for decades
nice they are fighting like street fighter just like here in india
and by the way
projection is perhaps the most important defense mechanism in politics
what are black jobs
as a 70yearold woman he is correct period there were fathers in home they worked hard mothers cooked and cleaned and watched after their children they helped them with homework if they could in the worst of times they loved each other and stayed together regardless of jimcrow attacks from kkk and social norms of that time family church community and the future were in our spirits and our minds and our hearts then johnson signed the welfare at knowing that it would cause internal grief and heartache it was the divorce of the family by the liberal government and affected all things about the black community even to now add the margaret sanger manifesto with abortion clinics had the lgbtq agenda to emmasculate the black american manthe mexican drug cartels and gangs and unchecked illegal guns in the black communities its the racistliberal elitiststhe wealthiest of america and george soros political hacks and main stream media now here is damon saying every thing ive said for 6 years and have been chastised for by friends family and associates for my whole republican political life i dont feel im alone anymore donald j trump 47th president may god save restore rebuild bless and prosper the united states of america let no weapon formed against this sovereign republic prosper thank you creator god amen amenand amen
013611 thanks president trump
i love when these 2 argue
debate for the chairman of us retairment village
see you never old and unable capacity biden
america is a set up
the difference between biden and william ruto is skin colour
i had to scroll down so far to find this video i swear they dont want people to see it
trump refused to answer some very critical questions trumps definition of a good election is one in which he wins
both these men need to sit down
gosh once again in american politics people are forced to choose the lesser of two weevils the poor country
amazing how many people think these are equals
5634 he cut the kids in half
lets gooo trump i like this man
im done watching cuz you guys are so biased against trump its pathetic
biden is a little wake
tell ppl the truth about jan 6 how 200 fbi agents and 1000 crisis acters in the croud with onions in their hands pretending their crying just youtube the videos its all over the place just youtube it everything n youll see whos lying
1st world country is a joke greeting from a third world country
biden keeps saying the idea after every opening sentence if only biden could have better ideas lol
americans think these old men will lead the american and retain its title of super power
putting commercials before trump every single time this is a joke n joey b is embarrassing to listen too dont talk about peace treaty dont talk about trump getting nominated for 2 nobel peace prizes when he starts jumpin around u guys stop him
wow what about white child care he is pandering to black people because no white people will vote for him
yeah bidens age is a problem much worse though is that 23 of republican voters still believe they dont have a legitimately elected president in 2024 that is the problem with the united states
both of these men have terrible egos with trump its always i did this and i did that and it doesnt seem to matter to biden that he may no longer be capable all he wants is to be president
trump i am the best biden i am the best of the worst
bidens got that gyatt
hamas has 5 american hostages israel killed 5 british humanitarians i wouldnt be surprised if no hostage come back its not like israel know where their hostages are but they flatten the whole of gaza
the idea the idea lol
both of them will protect israel at any cost are they really oppositions
we where lied too f coved
the ideea that biden took all the blows is commendable
biden should be sent to retirement home this is elderly abuse
release the hostages
fjb is a liar we need trump vote red
whoever has watched biden in last 2 years must feel like the establishment is literally trolling its citizens at this point dd i have no other explanation for this d
good luck trump xx
my favourite part is when biden says number one as though a second point would follow and then it never does at one point he had two number ones in a row
1158 pov that one door when your parents are trying to sleep
one minute biden is staring into space and the next minute he is trying to form another sentence
the amount of molarchy and lies coming out of bidens mouth is outrageous their should be some sort of immediate impeachment laws put in place when the lies get to this degree incredible
trump went back to mewing in 1549
does anyone realised biden never blink his eye the whole debate like a robot
i wouldnt let joe in charge of making a cup of tea i cannot believe you guys let him in charge of your whole country
biden number 1 the idea number 2 the idea sums up all his responses
people be critical thinkers they sounds like job interviews why what if the real leaders power behind is what they want us to see what if this is to blind us with whats real happening dont be deceived people time to wake up
just the walk up to the podium is funny
cnn reporter asks a question biden the idea that
why are this people walking like a robots sounds like scripted directed anything can be done nowadays
joe biden i wish you well but please take care of your health and stop running this country trump i dont think you have the power to change anything unfortunately
im feeling sorry for all the americans who is suffering because of this president who cant even answer questions thats so sad that this is your president
number one hes a lier number two hsdno funao fjir we finally beat medicare
this is so sad biden trump please retire
i still vote for president donald trump i stand alway president trumpgod bless america
will vote biden he isnt a ticking time bomb like trump
biden did not start the first time home buyer program it has been around fir decadeshoiwever the anount if nelanin on the skin was not ab issue would a freckel person qualify how is blackness measured now seems a kittle racialky biased atbface value trumo least corrupt president forgotten history channel buden most corrupt half a truth is usually a big lie benjamin frankkin
the ideathe ideathe idea the idea
i learned more from the comment section
as a vietnam veteran i knew the moment i heard it that that losers and suckers trump comment supposedly made about us was pure fiction and trump is right i dont know a single veteran who likes joe biden
the idea the idea the idea
train wreck in 3 2 1
communist left or logical right if you try to listen to this debate on mediumlow you will not be able to coherently hear what joe biden the democrat partys chosen president is saying this says a lot about their party throughout his entire term a lot
ive see heard enough this is the worst debate ive ever witnessed naninani booboo
men deciding what to do with a womans body
its easy to stay in power just ask the public what they want and then deliver its not difficult
even trump seems to be more concerned for joe then jill and his team let that poor man enjoy the rest of his life instead of making him a comedic piece on national tv
i think we need another person
10200 trump we had h2o and people jumps biden trump is a fool and a dangerous one i watched jan 6 did you he wanted a civil war he is the worst lying president ever no moral at all wake up americans
why are these our only two choices this sucks we need a hero
brah u sure that s the debate analyzed not president entertainment show thats so funny
the upcomming election is very important it will decide the order in the world future wars and economy and climate change
there should have been a word count right next to bidens side of the screen lord the amount of times he said the idea that had me rofl and im pretty sure that word count still cannot beat the percentage of inflation that his administration has caused
trnmump offereed 30k nation troop prior
these two are 159 years old combined the incompetens of the average american who seriously believe these two are the best candidates to lead the most powerful nation in the world the next four years whats the world coming to
lying biden should be in prison all he does is lie
everytime biden closed his eyes i thought they werent gonna open back up
trump 10000 2024 and beyond
joe please go home and get out of office trump 2024
as a non american this is absolute cinema
take the test joe
thank you very much my dear president dona√∂d trump
putin is the best president for usa
european here i never ever tought how hard to be being an american now i get that no offence
lets remind trump yeh america pays more into nato because america is in reality the worlds police man yous asumed this position of power because america was a wealthy country and for americas own security you wont pull out of nato because you need nato more than europe needs america besides you got no other friends to help you is china kiks off

trump2024 i want so far
best snl comedy skit ever
peace is something that only the proletariat wants governments want war war is profitable and it proves the leaders superiority they are the masters of the universe
watching this a second timewowtrump really destroyed biden
have biden walk up and down stairs without messing up he cant do it biden needs to retire
neither of these guys answered any of the questions cnn asked
omg biden 113 he thought he was getting married ans even said it backwards to hold to have
i love this episode of snl
they dont even give trump a chance to respond trump 2024
robert f kennedy rfk blows these 2 guys out of the water vote for rfk
why should the rich americans have to pay more in taxes for bidens failures only 3 billion was spent to aid homeless veterans people who fought and served this country while 66 billion was spent on immigrants
usa has become uncivilized due to decline in values and decency wealth does not dictate how civil you treat people there are disadvantaged race but they show great respect in their society it is so superficial to look at a country self worth based on money look at your leaders proud to display how much they can disrespect each other
11625 good comms
2724 it came from his son hunterrrrr the sass on this man is impeccable
im in california and the prices of car insurance is ridiculous and i have an excellent driving record
may the best team wins
trump they like me more than biden biden 2845
the thing i saw wrong with this debate was fjb wasnt wearing his flag on his suit and i believe trump will maga kag and thatsthat
i think biden needs to retire
bradle its no lir
america 1st
how many times biden says the idea or by the way
isnt there more to freedom than being rich or having everything maybe we confuse selfcenteredness with freedom we can be poor and still have freedom no freedom is having the choice to be a decent human being without being told how you have to worship how you have run your personal life how you choose your honorable future if we endorse and live like people without honor dignity respect and care for humankindfreedom itself could be an issue
i think the whole thing was them bickering like a couple of children and sadly thats probably bidens current mentality im not sure whether to laugh or cry
american we in trouble they both crazy god bless us
as a filipino i laugh at the american political sphere then i stop laughing realizing these 2 people can influence my country and the decisions china will make when they get elected to the highest position in a country with the most powerful military is this dark humor or something else
the failing president biden is good but trump is the man born to be an american leader not only for america but to all its allies
is it just me or has biden got parkinsons
this is just so epic i love it so entertaining yet feeling ambivalent that this is the president debate of one of the best if not the best countries in the world
gerilya cepet bwi
sonic 1st bwi lare dll
im fleeing the country i give up
watching from the uk id vote for a different 3rd party entirely because biden looks and sounds unfit for presidency and trump is not answering questions
you know what the leftist says they all say same thing as say it again and again and repeat as they saying the truth all over the world same the leftist doing and saying the same thing
omg i just watched this i know biden has dimentia but whats scary is what will we be with a bablong old man in debates with other world leaders he loed so much too i no longer sipport biden hes incompitent and not good for our country
lets not leave our the last 4 years of triple taxing
i thought trump never liked cnn
other countries got amazed by us donald no we were not other countries might grow into america 20 but thats not a foreigner dream its a nightmate
the ancors sound and look way better than mr biden so sad for him
honestly at this point if a baby ran for president that baby has my vote
1203 we finally beat medicare huh
catch and releasedemocrats are garbage
the fact that biden hasnt taken a cognitive test to be president is mind boggling for sure he cannot be reelected trump 2024
biden cant even speak let him leave his presidential seat and go to sleep
here is a record of the usa there has never been a candidate for the presidency of america who is dangerous for all the democracy of the world its the premiere
sad for you america they are actually like happen here in brasil all the nation between two terrible options two faces of the same coin
now if israel has water rights then that says iran has not right to water or how ever or who ever under human right all people have the right to water for drinking ect
re bidens allegation to trump of molestationits the pot calling the kettle black
we are a constitutional republic
thank you wsj for allowing free speech here wow
raine muncong wes
all im saying is if a man cant drive over 100150 yards on the golf course they have no business being president
horrible performance by the biden administration bidens too old dementia
it would seem joe has amnesia regarding the thirteen us military members that were blown up in afghanistan during his disastrous pullout in 2021
had to come back to this today because heard the stephanopolis interview a few hours ago biden didnt do himself any favors today still sounded weak confused angry even a bit vindictive in mentioning trump totally in denial about what the polls are showing think wsj has trump up by 6 well beyond marginoferror in that respect he was almost trumpian trying to present alternative facts that fly in the face of reality
for hawaii heres 50000 let me tell you something about me said biden nevertheless heard nothing since
to say groceries have went up 20 is laughable a lot of stuff ive been buying literally has doubled or more since biden took office
trump aint answer no questions he just arguing these dudes venting not debating
please answer the questions for god sake we need to know which each party will offer in change for our nation not which president is the worst every question
i would rather watch them box it out in the ring
in the first debate biden kept saying like a broken record heres the deal and now he kept saying by the way by the way
trump won hes bringing the facts for the most part joe dont know wth going on
i really want know what historians us government us history professors and socal studies teachers think of this debate right now
i hadnt watched the full debate till just now gotta say i didnt think biden did as bad as everyone is making it out to be im 100 positive he is beyond early stages of dementia or some other cognitive issue but i was expecting far worse now that being said i can only imagine what hes going to look like in another year or two trump was basically what i expected a handful of decent talking points mixed with a mountain of hyperbole
biden administration destroying the middle class now we see why hes been absent from his body this whole time
because i am proud of the united states of america and united states of africa remember forgotteni help trump in this campaign only the new tradition proned by mandela isnot goodif joe is 100years oldhe can continue to stay in chief of the un organisationbut i think that my r√©f√©rence trump is reelly the best choice
cant you see america
is this american presidential debate believe me i laugh the whole time i think its pure entertainment
the fact that hawaii is stuck in this sucks jesushelpamerica
we go with trumpbiden is a top failure
trump is much more cognitive
i think the real question is who is really running this country it cannot be biden making decisions due to his cognitive issues i suspect probably his wife
1157 so you dont have to find the we finally beat medicare part
im gonna tell my kids this was an snl sketch
joes is beating a dead horse with all the lies
coming and live in australia we have the highest house prices in the world sydney australia is the second most expensive city in the world today so dont bother coming here for a holiday your wasting your money
biden talks like who is lifeless he hasnt got a clue hes not fit to run
the best part was when trump says i really dont know what he was saying in the end
nice work do your homework on dave hes a legit conservative tulsi is also great
biden is old change trump next president again
so who will u vote is it biden or trump
i think the debate questions shouldnt ve given beforehand
i want to win trump he is true america near to world 3
two clowns
these guys are the aliens from the simpsons
i think our economy www great when trump was in office trump 2024
the only thing more embarrassing than this debate is the fact that there are now people who were very vocal about never ever voting for trump who will now give him their vote imagine being that much of a screw up that you turn people towards the person they vowed never to back
i hate that theyre not answering the questions
these 2 old men should retire from politics
this for biden my shadowens scott live trump him along am in moing care v scott vote for trump
elder residents shadow of the white house its what this nightmare is
god i hope trump can turn this country back to where we need to be before 2028 vote for trump 2024
i swear trump didnt need to prepare joe handed him the entire debate
you trvyhe fill o the pesitt
i already knew to vote for trump but now its very obvious biden just lies about what they are gonna do while trump tells it how it really is
theres motion between us
trump is the man we all need biden has destroyed this great country the world needs trump
on the survey trump was 43 rd out of 45 from worst to best joe has problems with communication but the survey claims hes actually doing something for the country compared to trump yeah right replace obamas spot with trump trumps spot with biden and bidens spot with obama
dr jilly husband best friend of joey biden that time was threanted by joey pure evil and criminal joey biden
trump is just the same slavering guy but america this is your 2 best guys change the system take money out off politics its vile promises from big monetary interest groups we will do this we will do that nope nothing to help the ordinary man and woman americans just wow this is rough
lord please help us that is all i will say god bless everyone reading this
lord please help us that is all i will say god bless everyone reading this
they created 15000 jobs in a country of 300 million people keep that to yourself
biden number 1 starts of slightly coherently number 2 starts to forgetting about number 1 number 3 starts to a complete word salad end with a mumbling
the bills have went up everywhere in the west we need a peace deal in ukraine and russia
we paid into social security our whole working lives no immigrant should get a penny of it or medicare
i think president biden shouldnt have been allowed to engage the debate a bit of slurred speeches isnt it appropriate for someone to act in his place not very easy being an opposition to a prospective and eloquent president like mr trump i admire the courage of joe biden he stood tall with valid points in my opinion
benjamin netanyahu had warnings im sure he knew something its pretty obvious that what he is upto
julius malena said it best you can have a platform to speak and say nothing that is mr joe biden
just rewatch this masterpiece again lol
2 old men running for president such a shame
this video has 20 million views
i remember trump planted 3 million trees around usa nothing done from bydins gang exept for there pockets
this debates was fantastic they did well except the situation of israel and palestinian and ukrainian no good answer rather then blaming each other
looks like biden needs a medic sad he is even a choice trump is kind of a joke but better then biden
lol wow just wow biden never should have been president and i voted for trump both times will be voting again for him watching this is just sad man biden is so far gone its crazy man
if blacks dont vote for joey obiden they are not blacks but wise
what im seeing from joe biden so far after watching half of this debate is him mirroring trump in the way he speaks lol and constantly accusing him of being a liar with no real evidence to support how hes lying so far this is a massive l for him donald trump is coming through with a far better argument even though im not siding with either of them because i think theyre both imbeciles in their own special way rip america was it nice knowing you no not really but you were definitely something
president trump all the way 2024 we pray that byedin doesnt fall victim to killery and obumba scary times indeed
good debate but trump had credible points indeed
byedins real wife cursed dr jilly and joey byedin before she passed away for what they did to her pure evil
and also he dodges to his republican people who are saying its all hoax about climate change the question about climate change that is thats what im talking here
why the eff is he numbering his answers that shows poor presidencies vote4trump
this debate makes it clear that the people who are really ruling the world are rubbing our faces in the fact that politics is now a complete joke and democracy is an illusion
nobody trusts cnn
they did everything they could to boost biden and make trump look bad biden still fumbled and bumbled throughout the entire debate
snl doesnt need to make a parody the original is gold enough
nothing but lies
cnn is corupt and work with governmentthey knew of biden failing
biden is embarrassing and trump said an impressive amount of lies great
its so obvious that biden doesmt understand economy
exactly the same battle that happened in 2020
joe biden is the worst president in the twenty first century crime has risen inflation out of control borders being overrun leaving americans and military equipment behind in afghanistan people loosing their jobs over vaccine mandates russian and china on the move increased taxes across the board and many other issues that could have been prevented
every time biden speaks i have to turn on the subtitle
joey byedin cares for other nations but not americans byedin is a joke that make you broke and woke
i am a foreigner and i do not live in usa not even in america at all i enjoy this
i think america is colapsing as rome did you are the president and jurnalist stops you in the middle of sentence how you can care america will dye as rome its happening right now under obama and biden not mr president kennedy
those two are not fit to presidents
trump said to biden i dont know what he said and i dont think he knows what he said either america the greatest country in the world have this kind of president for 4decades wowww i respect nice good job america
who came here to laugh
president biden you should quit you cannot menage this
no new wars under trump wars around the world under biden indisputable fact exact opposite of what the tv told us
fs in chat america is cooked lol
what about the kitchen table
this is hilarious
biden looks like the white version of al sharptongue 12220
wait lol did he just say that in the 4 years hes been president hes only created 15000 new jobs and then a further 800000 manufacturing jobs in a country that has a population of roughly 300mil of course theres more to be done youve done nothing
someone that is in joes mental state should not be allowed to be in any type of power let alone the president of the united states
biden should be thrown in prison for life
joe has made the us a laughing stock
i get why people are concerned for bidens mental acuity but i dont understand either why people see trump as a strong candidate when he doesnt speak any more clearly than biden help me understand please
im not american im your neighbor from up north this debate is as bad if not worse than our politicians up here yikes
biden is such a disgrace to our country get rid of him
the idea that joke biden is on stage debating w oldtimers instead of sleeping in a cellar is a bad idea
its funny they are asking trump about ending political violence when he has just been the victim of such on the highest level as biden has indicted him just because he is his opponent in this election incredible
the more cnn makes it blatantly obvious that theyre hand holding biden throughout this whole thing and still bidens falling just adds more support for trump always remember that
yupyupyuptrump is right about all of this stuff except abortion what woman wants there state to make her medicle decisions that should not be anyones bussiness so how do we get everything else fixed with trump but let go of our rights thats what is making me toss and turn
ive no dog in this fight but crazy joehas gotta go
cant someone mute this and by the way president it is very heavy to listen to him
painful to watch this circus
why do the presidents have to be on deaths door tho
im a veteran and i hate biden
what president trump says is just common sense too i mean lets pretend for a second that the phenomenon of 3rd world nations emptying their prisons into the us isnt well documented it is but lets pretend its not why wouldnt they do that biden told the world wed let them in with no vetting of course theyre going to dump vast quantities of troubled individuals into our once great nation leaders in those countries would be crazy not to do that
biden is not in good health to run needs to retire
people dont care about the national debt they care about the economy
biden is a major liar
the old man is delusional
bidens faces from la noire give me nightmares
nigeria should learn from this
i hate how neither of them answered too many questions but instead would continue their previous point
we beat medicaid ididnt know were fighting medicaid i thought medicaid helped people but i guess i could be wrong oo
biden is very articulate and more than right about everything i hope to god that trump does not win biden 2024 all the way
yup give them gas station swherws mine
i dont even know what biden says when he speaks all i hear is ta ta ta ta thats who you people vote for to run our country its insane
this country is going to fall apart this country needs jesus
definitely with trump tho
we had an economy in free fall if i remember correctly the stock market mooned with trump as president and gas was extremely cheap you joe are a disgrace
blue for crips red for bloods
id id been biden id have faked a medical emergency and left the debate
they forgot to mention that all debate questions were written by the ciadeep state since this debate was all planned and carried out under the umbrella of operation mockingbird
this debate should have been the last straw in your chance to wake up if youre still a leftist if you havent woken up after this debate then you never will and youre a lost cause
prolly the world leaders stayed at other hotel before trump hotel was built in washington dc needs to be looked into a little further to find these dems owned percentages of or was investors in the hotels these leaders stayed in before trump and this is why they are all riled up and making a big deal out of these world leaders staying in the trump hotel because they lost money no doubt
2 idiots on the mic better 2 watch alf
the questions are gaslite yall have to remember politics is business money power bills etc listen to trump that man smooth he know what he talking he is a business man and in business yes you win some and lose some but you learn most presidents dont come from a business savy background thats why we always in debt smh
lets go brandon i come from poland and i thought we were screwed read the cement is the best i can do today
australia offers
get him trump new york city stand up
2134 trump won the debate from my perspective
watching two guys on the verge of their deathbed this is a comedy fall of our government began in last election and will continue with this election
havent even watched it yet and im waiting to find out what youtube edited out
this debate has me stresssed
biden should retire and do asmr trump just need to stop trying
they are so ooold
there is no studio audience tonight biden walks out and starts waving and saying hello to the non existent audience
they raised my house taxes by three times
if i had to choose i would vote trump
joe the idea biden
i can see the passion in trump and how he speaks his very soul is furious and for a reason
titan is dumping garbage on us in the skies the snow is not snow its pellets of some kind of plastic the they create in the storms they create with their mission theyve got running its horrible
the democrats hired midnight guys to pull along and start wildfires you can see the videos on youtube people posted it they saw it democratic people are paid to start wildfires
dont tell me im the only one hearing that or my ears are failing me 11623
only a real american can save america
we are all cooked
any other options
take a shot every time biden says number 1
the tax credit that hes talking about they took it from the seller they took it took it from the amount the seller got he didnt pay nothing they didnt give nothing my daughter sold her house two new buyers and they took 11000 of her money out of her asking price
if biden was xman his super power would be no one could understand him nevermind how long he speaks
correct me if im wrongbut did they say there was no audience then biden walked out raising his hand as if there there were an audienceor was that for the viewers
interesting
demented trump a palestinian childs shoes are more precious than yours
most of those ppl support trump
2937 somebody walks in front of bidens camera
i just bought 13 essential items from the grocery store and it cost me 84 how on earth does our government consider that only a 20 increase this is more like a 100 increase
yea biden is in a custards last stand sitiuation and yet he wont apologize to anyone about anything
did he ever answer the question about deportation or did he evade it
fjb democrat they destroy our country biden is a liar he said to the american people under his leadership no troops have lost what is really sad he does not remember or honor the 13 brave soldiers who lost their lives in afghanistan and also left american citizens behind
whats going on in the white house alot of deoderizer i feel sorry for his wife
bidens famous line i dont care if you think im satan reincarnated
its like talking to my grandmother with dementia no idea what he is even trying to say put biden in a home and make sure hes looked after at this point this is elder abuse and the people forcing him to run should be in prison
i have the beginning of 46 thoughts biden jim carrey
is anyone really supprised biden is suffering either from old age or dementia either way hes got to go trump train
in pa all the new workers are imagrants they where approved for work visa
q would anyone trust biden to drive a school bus
this is actually a comedy
nancy didnt think trump was that dumb to send the crowd
the jar building works trumps if you remember trump was trying to dig this out and started creating the jobs all the first stuff that was done when biden got in was from contracts that trump did
exactly the same immigration situation as the uk something is definitely going on its literally identical
the didnt even answer the child care question
fast forward to the august conference jill delegates your choice is non negotiable and finaljoe remains the candidate and we loose in a landslide and you spend the resyt iof yiour days in folsom or i am the candidate we win with a landslide we keep the wh you keep your jobs and i become the most succesful president this counttry has ever had and thank your lucky stars
if biden wins again the election is 100 per cent rigged im pretty sure the last one was to be honest
is there no better candidate apart from trump and biden it will be much better to engage youngminded youths in politics 30 60 years of age
i felt like adam sandler was was going to take the stage and say welcome to another saturday night alive
the biggest thing to understand from this is that this is not a biden issue it is the entire democrat party after all they are clearly the ones that have been driving this entire term into the ground its painfully obvious that biden is not in the driver seat they are also the ones that have been lying to you about this mans mental fitness and they are still lying to us dont be stupid enough to think that you can vote for a better democrat
i have never seen an old man thats so good at lying why is everybody only talking about october the 7thwhy cant people talk about what led to october the 7th
americans help us vote trump again
on president biden first election i bet he will win and only a one time president he should allow another democrat run with trump otherwise sad
biden walks out on stage because of how used to giving speeches in n company of his close yes man circle he walks onto the stage hearing a roaring crowd chanting crowd 4 more years 4 more years biden waves at the moderators and the crowd the lights stop him from seeing the waves of people that arent actually present because he forgot there was no audience biden thank you thank you as if he was capping off the audience volume if you watch his speeches youll notice the same means of capping off the audience for a quick rebuttal biden actually said even more but they cut off his mic
i didnt like trump that much but id rather vote for him than biden that much
theyre doing more for veterans than ever before biden says im sorry but with what staff the ones you pushed out with vaccine mandates before deciding to not require shots after all the ones who jumped ship to other hospitals when the va couldnt match the pay increases everyone else offered to keep up with the inflation your administration caused the va im in touch with had to cut back on the total number of beds they could fill because they dont have enough nurses to tend to a full building a vet that i knew was unable to get admitted for inpatient hospice because the wait list for a bed was just too long
interest rates are up inflation is up and pay and jobs are down thanks biden trump 2024
both of definitely r definitely evils666
the latino never get anything on social we paid taxeswe come to work
trump must win
u gotta admit that u can see political foreign leaders respect trump more than biden hes made america look weak
like grade schoolers when they cry about the other kid took their crayon grow up work together yall spend all that energy focused against each other there is no one person that could save us to be frank so have one person as a leader is just greed
lets elect both of them maybe theyll become friends and make peace in united states
if i have to hear were in a position where or the idea that one more time
joe fyi this country is already bankrupt your reckless spending doesnt help the usa at all look at the national debt joe and its crazy interest every minute that goes by i am wondering if you ever took a college course in economics but if you did you forgot all the basics yoru idea that tax and spend illegal immigration your continual 6 working hours a day and continual vacations tells the american people you just dont care about us
we want imran khan vs nawaz sharif debate like this
im middle class and i never felt devastated until biden came into presidency
he got out of afghanistan like a headless chicken
biden moves like i do in my dreams when im trying to punch something or run fast
as a none american americans should listen to the whole worldas an asian my country might be against or with us but as a friend or a foe you guys need a real leader and here its clearly donald trump i feel dissapointed disgusted as if like im playing chess and my opponent joe keeps blundering
look like a sport event with the introduction seen like we all in this for entertainment
he did not answer the questionif he will d√©port every bodytrumpwill leave californialike floridalatino peoplewe do tje hard jobs
and the idea that
my vote is going to president donald j trump regardless of what happens
biden is me trying to hit the word count on a assignment at 1159pm
seeing this debate it just makes me sad that biden really doesnt know what hes doing its just sad
anyone know how many times biden said period
cnn well what can one say its unfortunate how debatable truth and facts are
so hes bringing new oppportuninties to new people anwyawy trump is more human and ur failing at that wtv dude who cares
trump will win people bit he will take us to ww3
but new people will come with trump
you called my son a loser and a sucker well hes not youre the loser and sucker thats not true you made that up and you should apologize to me right now wow just wow
u should change more nubba
u should change more ur making same expressions as hillary
just 4more years
but if biden would win we would be living better
summary of the debate between two candidate presidents of the worlds super power trump you are the worst president in the history of the us biden no you are the worst i am the best trump no i am the best you are the worst biden the ideathat i am the worst is outrageous number 1 number 2 you are the worst trump you are the worst president in the history and on and on
at this point feeding joe to trump is just straight up disrespect to trump come on mann give trump an atleast half joes age person
biden talking about protecting seniors while he lets his handlers drug him and prop him up on the world stage to make a fool of himself is not only rich but sadly ironic
4242 wow dude as if you reallly care
the capitol riot for example was such a dodge by trump
thank god i live in europa
12405 hes lying hes not a 6 handicap
why do we want a president that cant stop with the cursing i cant believe that joe biden goes on national tv and forgets what hes saying why would we want a president that is so far away from god please dont reelect this man that is willing to let the killing of innocent children go on
being a swede i could answer the very first question about the economy easily none of them answered the question they started pissing on each other from the 1st second why cant they just focus on the questions well my question is rhetoric we know the answer it saddens me to see the us falling like this
god bless america go president biden take your time and keep your cool america wins
bidens response at the first immigration sentence really knocked me out what was that even
trump cooked biden
nice trailer for this is america 2 by sasha baron cohen
yall leave joe alone hes doing a great job getting donald trump reelected
rules of debate were made to disadvantage trumpbut was advantage to him
my favorite part was when cnn bragged about how they were gonna fact check the debate and then proceeded to not once fact check the debate
is this america or some irish funny prime time comedy show mrs brown
biden is not fit for us president love for trump from india
biden ran for president so trump would not get the job not because he is capable good to know
we dont need to significantly increase biden anything we are being bent over in every way shape and form its horrible our families are struggling trump2025
trump must be intelligent to be able to focus on what biden is saying and decipher it without loosing focus biden actually is a lot more intelligible than i was expecting but he still fumbles his words so often that it is difficult to track what he is saying
ridiculous they are barely answering any of the questions lord have mercy on america we better pray
inflation is killing black and hispanic families and he caused the inflation go trump
gumpy old men 20 food stamps porn stars
trump went to israel to pray at the wailing wall the western wall in may of 2017 its on the dumb phone trump makes it clear what side his bread is buttered on trump also makes it clear to the american people that he does not represent the best interests of the american people dale cameron
biden amen so help as god in your way
why does trump look like the joker when he smiles
just look at biden he read from a tv screen just look at his eyes
i feel like biden argues like back in the old days where you could say anything because people didnt have easy enough access to internet
save america for christ sakes trump can save america save children from being attacked by illegals god
chicken dumplings is asian ravioli
all you families paying more for your childcare than your rent is dont worry that general was fired and those of you struggling with crippling addiction rest easy knowing biden is afraid of china women afraid of losing your rights covid i skibidi generalized persons put in place joe biden god help us all though it is refreshing to see that were not at each others throats in the comments anymorei will say that
where is robert f kennedy its a clear election fraud
i been trying to get an appt in the va since covid
looking for stand up comedy online and ended up here best one so far
what bidens family is doing to him its sad this man is confused sad and alone he needs to be home hell have a stroke donalds actually being nice to him
after the bombing belgrad no one will doubt who biden really is
biden might have been attacked with a dew directed energy weapon and not even known they are scaleable and sometimes feel to me like getting 50 iq points subtracted but 30 would do here
arent there any younger ppl than these two in the states why have to chose from 2 who are in their 90s or close to
i start to belive trump making south park cartman voice at somepoint lol
joe biden number one number two number three
joe biden hi folkshow are you famous words before disaster lol
monty brewsterrichard pryor had the right idea in running none of the above in brewsters millions in 1985 when running for nyc mayor because thats what i should vote for in november noneoftheabove uncommitted that or write in angela rayner or rachel reeves from the labour party for potus
i dont think people give biden enough credit for his excellent work at staying awake for over an hour
i bet even the coin was weighted all they do is cheat
if i was choosing a manager for my small business and these were my best two options i would shut down
trump never losthe was impeached and his vp jumped in
bixen does not carry his own bagwhat a joke
how is joe not ashamed of himself like how does he sleep at night what a disgrace he cant win
biden is like in other world
there is a ton of video evidence of corruption at the polls during the last election
wsj is sold
wait till they start using their domain expansions biden domain expansion 81 million votes trump domain expansion china
youtube is nerfing loading speed of this debate on purpose
they have destroyed our planet anyone that has ran this country and they personally dont care
putin and kim jong un definitely got out the popcorn when they watched this pure comedy gold
i dont recognize my country anymore and it feels scary
this is like south park
our country is in trouble and everyone in this world knows this no and if and no buts about it
trump answering no questions that he was asked and instead giving random opinions biden
i am from europe and am i the only one who watches it for pure joy
absolutely trump
youre the sucker your the loser biden 2625
i am be eleven but i can still see that joe is on crack
1430 2138 2334 2409 2653 3156 3550 3604 4525 4934 biden wth who is that
1 try understand who give rocket between russianukrainian 2 need fix this question 3 try stop conflict smart people when see conflict make try make stop conflict
america had a black president that was revolutionary america had a business man as a president another remarkable history and now currently are led by ambitious nd a dreamer but unfortunately old i believe the country has proven to the world that they give people opportunities and we respect that but now its not time for emotions nd keeping up with records but to get a true leader to lead the country america is going down slowly due to its weak leadership they should check african leaders every african country that has followed that pattern of emotions nd chrrismetic leadership they are donw nd out goodluck america
these ppl get on my nerves let them response to each other before you ask questions you keep asking questions like youre trying to avoid the facts that either of them may be trying to speak i get that these are important questions but quit asking them back to back like that
god bless america
biden we are the most admired country in the worldwith the finest history in the world oh my god this is absolutely hilarious joe coming to earth for one day after living in the space throughout his life
so many rules feels like a game show
big shame for america
trump again he will again in the whouse
biden sending billions overseas we need that money in america
if biden will win again china and russia will be very happy and other nation will not respect americans you have one of the softest president the us ever no more biden from the philippines
yes his son hunter and joe can be convicted for sending and allowing innocent people who know the truth about your administration
biden made sense but he did not speak with authority trump lacked sense honesty but spoke with authority i prefer a guy who sometimes makes mistakes is a little physically unstable but has ethics biden has not compulsively tweeted like a child having a tantrum or been moronic enough to suggest injecting bleach he has acted with the dignity his office note trump sidestepped his position on ukraine russia should keep all land it invaded now occupies he also pivoted on the issue of taxing the rich illegal immigration actually rose when trump was in power he restricted legal migration which could benefit america building a wall is pointless when illegal immigrants can use boats to avoid it if biden continues he must become more assertive as americans equate confidence with security it scares me that america may vote for trump who has a long history of crime corruption deception scandal would like to have the full authority of putin over america it seems that america has not just lost its judgement it has lost its reason
yes the biden administration has destroyed innocent people and their families innocent people had to go to jail under his administration bc we know the truth
can we just pump the comments to 1 million please
biden looks stoned when hes not talking
no more biden us citizen you are not a respected nation than before having biden as president
3306 belorussia is not nato
having a president who looks like he is constipating and is unfit for presidency really shows how developing we really are in our country
why dont cnn comment on his speech impediment i thibk they on his side
oh my god trump is a terrible man with his antagonising words so bitter
a basket of groceries that cost 100 in 2020 cost over 120 now man i need to shop where he is shopping more like 170
biden is so slow trump you are very focused man
us middle class did a whole lot better under trump biden is wild
dude i should have cross the border
name calling what we 4th graders now
the bidens need to be tried for treason
biden was responding to questions with prepared answers trump got real time questions from the moderator
bring crypto back
mostly what im hearing is a lot of conjecture and opinion not a lot of statistics or facts theyre just playing the blame game why do we have to have dinosaurs in office
when was the last election in 2020 everyone around including celebrities hated trump everyone was for biden trump was ready to be torn to pieces in the street in comments on youtube videos he was hated you can find these 2020 videos and read the comments what happened now people
if you dont lower the taxes for the rich they would just take their money out of the country and it will destroy the economy
made me laugh when they talked about golf
as an egyptian i heard grocery that costed 100 then now costs 120 and i started laughing to us what costed 100 pounds then now costs 1500
we beat medicare bidenwill never forgot this
after these elections when biden steals the votes again i know the american people will rise and there will surely be a civil war
i wonder that this two old men are still strong and eagerness to serve for the seat of president of usa how luck america peoples for their reasonable leaders
the hilarious show i had ever seen
its hard not to lolbiden looks mortified is it crazy to question whether he maybe has been fed a false narrative by a go between america really has been run by the same peoplecountries posting their troops or just ppl whom where strategically coerced in america disguised as immigrants im not even pro trump but joe did seek retribution and whats sad is its not even surprising i highly doubt the founding fathers included the 4th amendment with the idea it could be circumvented by one mans reasonable suspicion america was built off of freedom yet ppl isnt even free to control their own consciousness this is the country that technically defines addiction as a disease but nonviolent addicts take up much of the prison space costing something to the tune of 80000 each per yearsome sitting 20 year sentences for a drug that is now legal and sold in storesim willing to bet a one time payment of 80000 wouldve prevented so much suffering ultimately getting passed down for generations if used towards prevention with mental health resources the last thing we need is to fund prisons and police any further
just take a look at bidens face
america is cooked
as someone in the militaryi cannot stand joe biden zero respect for joe biden and his crooked people
i think donald trump or joe biden shouldnt be president at all i think we should have 2 new candidates does anyone agree
joe should be charged with treason
as usual the republican propaganda machine snipped the single worst 5 seconds to make joe look bad but he gave a vastly superior answer to every question hands down
at 1655 minutes into the debate biden began a nonsensical response after speaking for 103 minutes into his allotted 2 minutes response time the cnn mediator saved him with an assertively stated thank you that cut him off in midsentence although he still had time left she spared him the embarrassment of almost another minute 57 more seconds of a gibberish response
this is like a standup comedy during covid19
look at both of them
lord have mercy if these are the two best candidates that can run for president on the republican and democrat ticket neither one of them are any good
that isnt such a thing as white spanic or black jobs jobs are jobs period
ive gotten to the point that when biden opens his mouth i turn the tv off i simply cannot stand listening or watching anymore
since the first question is a straight up lie i dont expect much from this
how many times does biden says the idea waving his barbie hands trump
groceries are double not 20 more good grief fast food is four times more in my area their factcheckers for the announcer questions are waaaay off
trump 2025 maga
i dont think anyone questioned the usa being the most powerful country on earth since at least 36 years but the usa is still a joke to everybody but where these two senior citizens are wrong it was not in 2021 and not in 2017 when it started it started way earlier and gets worse every year take this example the uspresident is one of the most powerful leaders any democratic country has yet the debate looks like a discussion in a senior residency
send biden home to rest and enjoy his remaining fruitful years he has worked very hard no need to work yourself till your last breath anyone who vote this man in for another term is an abuser
we finally beat medicare
presidential immunity has just been amended by scotus the president can seal team 6 trump if he wants to do it as an official act
long live the king of the world king donald trump
if trump was in power there wouldnt be a war nato wouldnt of dared have done what theyve done
just count the brandon lies through out his 50 years of service which the only ones he serviced wasis his cronies and his famillia the bcrew is worth millions use common sense do not believe the msm polls trump is almost double the numbers the msm is claiming be sure to vote dont allow what happened in 2020 to happen again
if you want real american president with the world respect trump is the president joe needs to go its enough he cant handle the job joe too old for the job think america think twice joe hardly can walk for his own and hardly can talk
my son was not a looser was not a sucker you are the looser you are the sucker
and that ladies and gents is all the proof you need that this man is not the one running this country he is merely a puppet
biden is a bit older show some respect
the most patient president on earth is biden selfcontrol
joe and people should be the ones held responsible for the war in ukrainian
my brain needs a 2hrs nap after watching this
a 100 bag costs 120 now its much worse than that
different states having different abortion laws is great you dont agree with abortion laws move to a place you agree with still in the us and happy perfection
fredric malle
creating jobs doesnt fix the economy raising wages in existing jobs does
prayers for american elections the world future will rely on the american new president god bless america and the world happy 4th of july to all americans
how did american allow this biden to become a president when this dude talk it doesnt make sense at all i dont what language is he speaking
incredible how they had to mute each other for interruptions because of last time
not impressed democrats plan in action question is whos his replacement biden was the clown show the distraction once america becomes full blown communist then what
lahaina people still cant access their own homes or property
if democrats came to power only god can save america
im positively astonished comments are not disabled on this good job on wsj to enable freedom of speech
joe hes criminal for a babies approval to die why you people believing that ideology theres something wrong thats mean demons spirit ordered only sad very sad if you love human beings
im a foreigner and i support trump
actually i felt so sad for biden i hate those who forcefully make him go through this he shouldnt be running trump showed great restraint for him
people understood that if you have money you dont need government and that is why government fight to have the rich taxed
well i would be grateful if im as fit as these two at their age
the us is a big joke
normally i wouldnt care whether it were a democrat or republican but all i can say from this is that if youre siding biden youre brainwashed lol
all i got from biden number one period
imagine if they started any of these answers with yes or no instead of this hes lying bs
donald trump was waiting for this moment to come
furlongs were not technically job loss
honestly this is pure comedy gold
i cannot understand a word what biden says
agree to trumpthe worlds blowing because of biden because his business is weapons for warhe love warhe love people sufferinghe love people dying around theworld
great
its true boarder open because biden created warthats why he can use to this people for his war
cnn hardly gave trump is extra time after each question to answer bidets rebuttal but biden was always given that extra time
how is a man who is hardly managing to talk the most powerfull man on earth
whenever im having a bad day i read these comments yall too funny
this is just show nothing else is biden robot or looks like
donald trump is the man to fix america that is being rejected across the globe for the first time in history their military is humiliated and chased out of africa like dogs
biden confirmed aliens exist 10921
as a russian i found this both funny and terrifying i have no idea what is really going on in your country but i wish you a better leader who will listen and finally hear what you guys want and need inside your country and inside every american family and not what russia or ukraine or afghanistan or anyone else needs or doesnt need you got a great country with incredible history and strong people but it doesnt mean you dont have problems inside but look what these two people are talking about putin putin putin zelensky russia ukraine and just couple of words about their homeland about all of you we are pictured as cold bloodthirsty haters but thats not true we are not that bad as for me and all people i know we dont hate anyone we also want peace in this crazy world and we also want to invite all of you to come and see how we live and to know us better youll change your mond
im a muslim i support donald trump
total fake news if you dont post the real debate that had a higher viewership than cnn rfk jr clearly won over this clown show
for me i want trump to be president againtrump mind if for business biden is warpreak minded
how is biden a leader of a nation as an albertan i cant stand trudeau but does biden know where he is
poor america they both suck
us is the most admired country in the world yep and an offender is the most admired person by their victims with stockholm syndrome i love the us and us people but i think your politicians should care about the us way more than they do now
what bs trump talked about he could not really answer even one question baiden is too old to deliver his answers fairly
we had the greatest economy in the history of our country i burst out laughing at this
we need younger men alpha males that excel in business and finance or have had major success running fortune 500 companies and just a super smart business oriented 3555 years old that can get deals done that are good for the usaoh wait i know just the person oh but he cant because he was not born in the usa who am i thinking of
dem two shud put gloves on n fight
trump the whole world is blowing under him thats true
zelensky is no longer a president his time elapsed
you dont like people with swasticas and torches in your country but you support and finance them in ukraine shame
greatest country now
joe must go back and never return
this joe guy seem like the type person that destroys everything
the population of the united states is over 340 million are there not two more decent people among them they are the humiliation of america both of them is this where your blessed democracy has gotten you fix your system
biden i created more black businesses than any administration in history all i see are black barbershops and african hair braiding businesses
someone independent needs to go through this and fact check every word sentence and fact lie they spoke it would be interesting to see the results
this season of america is going to be so wild i cant believe this show got more crazy than both rick and morty and black mirror yet somehow still manages to be believable except maybe biden hes a little over the top in terms of not being able to make a comprehensible sentence but i guess it kinda works too cant wait to binge it
its sad that these two are our options
take a sip whenever joe comes up with the idea youll be dead within an hour
that was the best comedy movie ive watched for quite some time oscars all round
1705 what border does he refer to the border with canada
trump should win
there was a wall biden dismantled it nuff said
hes tripping over words but everything biden says is way more substantial than trump
if you are not an american and watching these clowns for entertainment and laughs
trump the best
wsj propaganda machines how about telling your viewers the truth for once that ukraine war is biden war which he loosing on a wide scale
i was depressed for a long time and i looked so useless and bad this music helps me relieve fatigue and stress
american is run by 2 dinosaur
trump is coming
german nation does not wish its 001 interests to be determined and 002 controlled by any foreign nation france 005 to the french england to the english 007 america to the americans and germany to 009 the germans we are resolved to prevent 011 the settlement in our country of a 013 strange people which was capable of 015 snatching for itself all the leading 017 positions in the land and to oust it for 020 it is our will to educate our own nation 023 for these leading positions we have 025 hundreds of thousands of very 026 intelligent children of peasants and of 028 the working classes we shall have them 031 educated in fact we have already begun 034 and we wish that one day they and not 036 the representatives of an alien race may 038 hold the leading positions in the state 040 together with our educated classes above 043 all german culture as its name alone 045 shows is german and not jewish and 048 therefore its management and care will 050 be entrusted
for more entertainment watch indian parliamentary debates
if this 2 are future for the usa than just no comment
both of them are beyond the grave and one is a criminal
like him or hate him trump gives yes and no answers rare for a politician
americans do have other people who can be presidentanyway its better trumpbiden seems out of place an old man who does not know what is happening
trump did not answer about israel genocide of palestinians
this is so embarrassing
anyone who would vote for biden is the problem
president trump was great he let biden say his peace and did not interfere in correcting biden very classy indeed never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake napoleon bonaparte everything that biden said did and didnt do tonight is a direct result of his wife the deep state the swamp demorats and the luciferians using him to keep power they know that biden is just a shell of a man and they will try to squeeze him as much as they can to benefit their own personal interests shame on all these abuser what they cannot control is the fact that bidens life is in gods hands anything can happen in four months in the us we worship the only true god and the only true savior jesus christ our lord god has everything in his hands and he will give everyone involved in this demonic charade their due retribution
baiden n1 nr 2 h says ale taimedement go toy bed pleasthe werst predisent ever
the best predisentate are trump nr1 he dont start no wars
its so pretty
love you biden trump is a traitor
highly recommend
do you know what everyone complains that biden is so old and he could kill over but the moment you ignore that noise and actually listen to what hes doing what hes tryna achieve aka reverse the stupidly of roe v wade apart from palistine and israel he seems to know what he is actually doing nobody actually brings up anything todo with his policies being bad
2023 did not have the highest temperature in revordered history thats false that occurred in 1913 in death valley134 f the question is not even true
could somebody please explain to me why jimmy carter is not presidential candidate is he not filling good or there is some other reason
pretty good
first of all i agree that biden was unsteady and the democrats should name a different candidate but i find it hilarious that the socalled experts say trump won the debate let summarize his results 1 he never answered the exact questions and when he sometimes did he lied shamelessly 2 he was throwing great words like best ever and worst ever without any foundation or source 3 he was like a whining child from the daycare the veteranssoldiers like me better than him and so on 4 he showed no sign that he has any kind of program for the future administration at all yes if you see how they talked maybe trump was better but in a political debatediscussion it is way more important what they say from a professional point of view it was more meaningful what biden said and he was trying to answer the questions he received not to avoid them
untut sakit dll wes
reminds my kid supposedly arguing
lets not forget during a us senate debate on busing for racial desegregation in 1977 thensen joe biden said unless we do something about this my children are going to grow up in a jungle the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point
biden sways from side to side constantly
i thought i was watching comedy central but then realized it was cnn
i wish you great success in your health love and happiness
bygone could hardly speak properly looks like he has asthmaand could hardly moveis he really sicki feel sorry for the old man
darn trump was alway dealing with their shenanigans the game spent so much time so much hate from the lefti dont know much about about politics im learning what happened to people
the only truth is that america is sinking the democrats are lying to you and if they stay in power america will have nothing donald trump is worthy to be the president of america because he speaks the real state of the nation which is the most important thing he is highly respected by russia and china
all these tax cuts gonna ruin the country just like last time trump was president
drugs and opiod is every countrys problem its not only in america you cant stop it when demand is high drugs like coke heroine phenta etc is gonna be there the most important is stopping the route the route where it is coming from
i think i expected better from trump than what i have heardi have not heard any question he has answeredam disappointed with trumpbut any way am not american
scholars took a pole to vote on who the worst president was pretty sure there are biased views what scholars would even waste their time om that
these people are both disingenuous liars and neither deserve our votes
trump for president 2024
god what bad thing we do to deserve jake tapper
a few months ago i was watching a political commentary on tv in portugal and one commentator said this more important than anything that is currently happening in our country politics wise will be the outcome of the us presidential election in terms of the impact and influence it will have on the everyday life of ordinary people the president of the usa it turns out is not only the president of the usa it is one of the if not the presidents of the entire world however only americans get to vote from an european perspective no one wants trump i wonder if people in the middle east or other parts of the world are any different granted putin will probably prefer trump all i can ask to the american people is to please be responsible when voting because the world is in a mess wars in ukraine palestine sudan etc and your leader is not just your leader he is one of if not the main leaders of the world whoever you elect it will have very different and profound consequences outside the usa perhaps even more so than within
whenever boss trump speak the way sleepy joe stare at him
who is actually running the country
i cant believe these are the two options we have despicable fighting over who is the worst president is just shameful
im from africai elect donald trump to be the president of america because joe biden should be take a care to live himself alive
joe dimentia is the corspe and cheif
i just watched this debate it wasi would say an embarrassing time for both but mostly for biden biden kept attacking trump and then trump retaliates again againand again like 2yearolds blaming each other who broke the window and instead of answering the questions joe bidens response in taxing large business owners is dumb because that will drive the prices higher which would increase the cost of food and clothing further anyone that knows basic marketing should know this anyways if i had the choice in picking one of these 2 i would have to pick trump
im a democrat but this is sad enough my state is suffering from the the biden admin we want change illegal immigrants are pouring in we need to stop this i am not voting for biden i vote for trump sorry im done with my partys bad policies
putin is a liberalconservative and reactionary you americans need the same yes we have an authoritarian democracy in russia not authoritarianism do not confuse these two things and there is nothing wrong with this since democracy in each state has its own for example peoples democracy in china primaries of the communist party of the peoples republic of china islamic democracy in iran they will soon have presidential elections greetings from a russian from moscow
we need trump back period biden is a joke
this is so awesome
am not from america dear people im from africa but honestly if you want to save the world kick biden out of that office the world has become worst under biden supporting wars and silly things all over sanctions after sanctions to souverain countries stupid sanctions that impact no one anymore america is losing its value and worldwide respect under biden the man is sick and we can clearly see that his international politics is
bidens better off having a high school speech and debate student up there
its so wonderful
very interesting
am i the only one who thinks this was fun
poor biden he is obviously half gone tired and too old to do this sounds to me like his ego and greed will take him to his grave on stage if he keeps going
did america run out of people why are two visibly demented elders running for the highest office
why does biden fuel weapons to stop a war
this was all trump cnn did their best to rescue joe but his performance was pitiful im shocked they allowed this to ever happen
hi everyone whoever is reading this just wants to say that we are all praying for each other that everything will be ok and that you will shine like a rising star with great success and wealth
everytime that trump speaks biden start steering at trump and look to confused he is trying to keep up with trump but his brain is trying to go to sleep its like he is a zombie in the walking dead
i dont like the guy who coordinates this debate he doesnt pay attention when president trump wanted to make a response to biden
both these guys are way too old they are supposed to stay in bed
this debate was poor trump did better but i hate the fact that our options for a president are bad and worse
looks like trump had everything on his finger tips
debate to determine the best direction for the future
i wanna see them to put gloves and enter the ring to settle that debate
very interesting
everytime jb speaks here i was hopin he didnt collapse hes finished
biden looks very tired too old to be a strong leader trump 2024
president biden you did well you made clear and concise points donald trump did what he does bestlies on top of lies and make up storiesabsolutely no substance and no truth only if donald trump would accept his follies then just be real with the americans he would gain international respect president biden is psycally frail but he knows what he is speaking about
were so cooked
lets go joe you got this
president biden you got this
is it supposed to feel like a joke why does this feel like a skit
joe is willing to financially brake and destroy the country in the name of climate politics
south park gonna be happy with this one
the biggest catastrophic failure of 2 politicians that are trying to be presidenttrump was bad but biden was in outer spacehe didnt even know where he was atits just pitiful
the so called dictator offered a vax that was wonderful the puppet came along and said you will take this shot im thinking ill go with the guy that wont take my livlihood away if i dont do what he says
i am not american and dont know how you pick prisdent but in my country we dont make dementia patients our president
one week later and dementia joe is in even more shambles trump 2024
food is more than 20 its about 300 biden on the other hand exaggerated and fibbed 200
id like my time back plz this was all totally predictable no surprises for me
jake tapeworm and dana gashclown world
2 old crazy prunes
greatest debate ever thank you cnn
biden did make some good points here and there but he keeps stumbling through his sentences which is hard to watch cant believe these 2 are going to lead america smh
biden the idea how many more times you have to say that president trump got my vote definitely i dont want dementia biden running our country
biden is reading the script
joe looks like he just finished a tom platz leg day in between questions
make america great again go trump
oh were cooked beyond cooked atp
where is fentanyl from china how did it get so much more under biden open borders how can biden say that drug overdoses are lower than ever has he seen news or anything 10s of thousands of people die every day of an overdose its never been higher before i lost 3 people to this disgusting stuff that shouldnt even be here in the first place
so america wants a president who doesnt know which string to pull on another president so things in his country works do i even need to mention names
dear americans choose only biden
free phalestine
america is in trouble this is sad
i love reading your comments thanks very much
trump just lies and biden is incapable of lying because he cant understand the question
5530 biden looks like he fell asleep when she mentioned black mothers and black americans and then he wakes back up when she says white americans at 5537
3202 since the beginning of the russian invasion in february 2022 the united states has provided substantial aid to ukraine as of early 2024 the total amount of aid approved by congress for ukraine stands at nearly 175 billion this includes a mix of military economic and humanitarian assistance military aid the largest portion of this aid approximately 1174 billion has been allocated for defenserelated purposes this includes weapons systems training and intelligence support for the ukrainian military economic support around 348 billion has been provided through the economic support fund aimed at sustaining essential government services in ukraine such as law enforcement and other critical infrastructure humanitarian aid an estimated 226 billion has been dedicated to humanitarian efforts including support for refugees and other forms of economic assistance much of this funding is used not only to directly support ukraine but also to replenish us military stockpiles and support defense manufacturing within the united states council on foreign relations crfb csis
biden no there is nothing with illegal immigrants happening american flags are getting burned in new york la is the capital of crime and stealing
2914 as of early 2024 the ongoing war in ukraine has resulted in a substantial loss of life civilian casualties are estimated to include over 10000 deaths and tens of thousands of injuries since the conflict began additionally military casualties for both ukrainian and russian forces are significant with estimates suggesting nearly 500000 troops killed or wounded combined these figures highlight the severe human cost of the conflict which continues to escalate as fighting persists for more detailed and updated information you can refer to sources like the united nations international organization for migration and other monitoring agencies al jazeera national immigration forum wola
pricing homelessness loneliness car dependencies all that under biden was never larger before
these are wars that will never end with him donald trump
biden lied righ on the first questiondamm
trump was landing blow after blow after blow trump has command of the information and biden told several lies the fact checkers should have fun critiquing biden
111230 i burst out laughing when he said we are the most admired country in the world you need to get out more joe your the current world power that does not make you the most admired
we love president trump2024
like in austria where the aborigines are gone you all fighting but all those people who owned those lands dont existe anymore keep fighting
grocery prices in the united states did not go up by 100 but they did see significant increases during the recent period of high inflation heres a detailed look at the situation key points on grocery price increases inflation impact inflation impacted many sectors including groceries with notable increases in prices the overall consumer price index cpi for food at home increased significantly from 2021 through 2023 percentage increases according to the us bureau of labor statistics bls the cpi for food at home increased by 65 in 2021 114 in 2022 and continued to rise in 2023 but did not double in price specific categories saw varying increases for example in 2022 the prices of meats poultry fish and eggs rose by 125 and dairy products increased by 118 us customs and border protection us customs and border protection contributing factors supply chain disruptions ongoing disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic continued to affect production and distribution labor costs increased labor costs due to shortages and wage increases also contributed to rising prices input costs higher costs for raw materials transportation and packaging impacted the final prices of groceries global events the russiaukraine conflict further exacerbated food prices especially affecting commodities like wheat and corn us customs and border protection us customs and border protection detailed statistics meats poultry fish and eggs up 125 in 2022 dairy products up 118 in 2022 fruits and vegetables up 84 in 2022 nonalcoholic beverages up 80 in 2022 us customs and border protection us customs and border protection sources us bureau of labor statistics us department of agriculture usda in summary while grocery prices have risen significantly due to various economic factors they did not increase by 100 the increases were substantial but varied across different food categories
this shouldnt be a debate like trump said i genuinely dont now how biden got elected last time by the american people becuz any normal person can see the pure contrast in the physical and mental conditions between the two candidates so like either the votes were rigged which is a terrible sign for the american country and its democracy or the american people willingly voted joe to be president despite him being literally incoherent and acting real creepy in front of young girls which is still a terrible sign how failed the american people and country were
its like that cartoon skit where u got a date with a girl but youre nervous so your friend gives you an earpiece and tells you what to say but you still manage to ruin everything haha
why tf atlanta gotta be hosting this thing we just be letting all kinds of shyt happen here
every one in america is from everywhere else what about the owner of the land
great video ive been following it
great video ive been following it
the video is very good
the rich are getting richer
the teleprompter is excellent how much anti dimentia pills did he take
biden 650 708 absolutely insane misinformation this guy is not human
i just wonder why biden still the best choice among democrats we know hes too old to walk on stage we know he sometimes forget what hes talking about while having a speech he allows illegal immigrant to flock in to the southern border what do you think he will do for the next 4 years
the only criminal here is the man im looking at right now gazes off into the distance

400 for insulin
trump was so funny
trump for president no ends and buts arriba mr trump
when the people can agree that both these candidates are absolute trash we can move on as a country
the people will have to unite and make changes
me as a student of english language is very difficult to understand what biden is saying and sometimes i think he either dont from trump i only heard he speaking about immigrants they are taking our rooms our beds our social security etc clearly trump are wrong about immigrants cause they are crucial for the economy grow but he is right about some criminals and people with mental problems crossing the border illegally and for everyone is clearly that biden cannot grab any public job he is having some cognitives problems that could being worse with time and that could dive the us in a deep crisis of credibility good luck usa
dang this was an embarrassment
god the republican party is a joke
donald trump should never become president after leading an insurrection against the government
1303 thank you president trump said jake tapper right after biden froze for 15 seconds and effectively lost the election he like millions of others knew the import of that moment
simple bidens got to go lets get our country back on track trump had our country safe and affordablebiden is destroying our country coke in the white house is ok with bidenseriouslyin real life someone is going to jail
2 idiots in the making one slightly more sensible than the other
trump save world
that those two are presidential candidates is just sad
putin and xi jinping are laughing at the corner be like
old joey got that deer in the headlights look
biden is not my president
woaoh president trump what a good behavior you are the president noone else
lookikg at the debate i find we shall have a new candedat me why im allready 86 years alld i can go in stares and im a good demokrats george sweden
watching biden was the best comedy ive seen on tv in a while
very inconvenient for the jewish faith to know that the only reason israel is still around is because the largest christian nation in the world is supplying its war needs very inconvenient indeed
o mi lord biden whas cruchedpoor seniel man
live presidential debate for the future of america and yall allow them to argue back and forth on who is better at golf for such a great nation your leaders make you look stupid everyone is laughing at you do something
how many times did sleeppy joe started his phrases with the idea
i havent seen such raw intelligence and thoughtful performance since huff and doback
we finally beat medicare sleepy joe
just checking this is the real debate and not some sort of ai fakery right it seems too unbelievable to be true
i was in the states a couple of times this year and i cant believe how expensive the groceries have gotten as a canadian with justin trudope running my country it is expected but i wasnt ready for the usa to be the same edit not just groceries everything has gone up in price except for peoples salaries
so scared for the us with this mad man and this unfortunately to old gentleman
biden is the us version of sunak
he just needs some super male vitality
biden trying to sound smart by starting every accusation at trump starting the sentence with the idea that biden mustve thought watching some ben shapiro videos would make him sound smarter
tulsi best choice for vp
the biden administration should be ashamed of themselves for what theyre doing with this poor elderly man its called elderly abuse what theyre doing to him he needs to be at home resting or in a retirement home he sounds like the elderly patients i see in the hospital i work in in the golden years department
2625 oh boy he took that personally
biden says he wats to tax us 249 percent crazy
i gave this a thumbs up because president trump won hands down
of course biden still wont take a cognitive test because he would fail and he avoided the question twice
this is not the full one
just listening and feeling somehow relaxed that politicians everywhere are same
towards the end of the debate biden didnt andwer the question about weather his age would affect 4 more years he avoided it and talked about something else completelyand made me sleepy
11625 bidens guts murmured to show disagreement
what a joke all of it
trump never answered any questions he was in other planet completely lost
i dont understand why people would vote trump again biden is not a good candidate for his mind problems but i would rather vote for him instead of trump white people can vote for him but black people should not vote for him us citizens have memory lost like biden too to forget why they did not vote for trump again they forgot what trump has done to black people
the ideathe idea that this corpse is president is despicable
i just saw this and went straight to the comments coz thats where the real action is happening
besides bidens dementia he did absolutely nothing but lie and repeat old fabricated and disproven slanders against donald trump fjb
why do trump hate foreigner in their country
lets play the absurd stupidity game i would vote and elect a magic 8ball dice and use the treasury to buy lottery tickets to pay debt and solve all problems before trump solves trumps financing pays banking loans and all his actual business frauds 100 legally
only thing i have seen trump do is build a half azz wall and separate families only good thing he did was given us those stimulus checks
thanks youtube for playback speed 2x
need somebody young new and vibrant in the white house all these old mo foes they put in there both of them look like they have spell senile
why is everything a lie
why does the biden keep repeating himself
biden from beginning to end he keep lying does he think we are stupid what do you think
this was so funny
biden isnt blinking seems he has a lot of botox and probably some drugs to help him concentrate hes out because of his performance in the debate wonder why he was even a nominee
trump mistake number 1 he didnt shake the hand of his opponent when he walked on the stage i dont care who you are who the other guy is who is right and who is wrong courtesy decency and respect is obviously he and many many other people dont get has the american society stooped so low i guess it has
trump is leadership
out of all the individuals in america this is what they have what a joke
maybe the people your talking to looks at you as a weak president and taking advantage of you
3010 as an iranian girl i can say that all the iranian people thank trump for that god bless him
i think this president b is sleeping the entire debate and he is dreaming he dont see himself getting worst
joe wake up pops
the truth is biden spent 1 week at camp david preparing for this debate and im sure he knew the questions long before the debate also the lies biden tells are never ending
debates really are better as musicals
i really hope biden stays on the ticket just so i can watch a second debate
god bless you trump we standing behind you
haha what a show good luck americathe world is depending on you nope probably boiled down to these 2 guy
hopefully people vote with their head instead of their this time
go take your nap biden we dont have time nor money anymore to pay for your corruption anymore
debates have come a long way since biden has been in office if you have to have all these strickshands than that says to me someone is hiding behind these strickshands i want honest questions answered
this is onna be a meme for aure
both of these candidates are absolutely terrible not one of them will even answer these questions
i cant believe people watch this and actually think that biden is a good choice its driving me insane every time he answered i had a question because he never fully answered
tax breaks are universal in the united states if the wealthy dont get the tax breaking either do you so either the government controls you or you control the government why should we the people bow down to the government hasnt the government forgotten individual sovereignty
by watching this debate my confidence got 100x boosted i also qualify for the position of presidency it seems
trump speaking full words biden constantly stuttering and mumbling
trump was right about everything its time to admit it biden is clearly unfit he is a pathetic embarrassment
please i beg off you just be fair and truthful just be honest for once i know that there a people there that know whats right from wrong search yourself and do whats right so help you god
un believable this is the worlds leader
imagine trump singing he not like us that would age well
dementia joe has got to go
trump aint lying unluckily i had to leave my home because it had black mold moved me my spouse and our five children in a motorhome temporarily until we got back on our feet that was 2020 we were sick for a long time after and couldnt work so we desperately needed help with housing i was bedridden and my husband wasnt much better trying to take care of me and the kids out of desperation he had to leave me and go back to work dec 2023 my husband makes almost 2k a week and we cant get our credit fixed from the remaining mortgage on the mold house and get a place still because bills grocerys and everything is so sky high every pay check is gone quickly and we have nothing left to put towards debt to fix our credit enough to get approved for a place been on section 8 for almost three years obviously i applied years before he went back to working thats never been such a long waiting list in maryland and it is disgusting to see what ppl in our situation are going through in ny chicago and all the other places flooded with people who are getting housing and placement and the residents arent just terrible
we need trump back please
biden waved at an empty crowd
wow trump
biden exposing corruption democrats have produced
president donald j trump 2024 we love you
americans can u please bring back trump biden must rest
cnn must be proud of bidens debate they helped make him so incompetent
joes face the hole time tho
1207 the biden presidency ended
economy collapse happen when 340 biden took charge theres no work lol
i so hope biden remains fit to stand trial meanwhile trump still signs the military awards while the fakes broadcast from a fake newsroom
two cias puppets secret team deep state owns politicians all about bread and circus baby
trump dominated totally and he didnt even have to try
11625 sounds like a shart
he doesnt need to answer the questions he has already shown us what he can do put that in your pipe and smoke it
its really a simulation cant be real
i smoked a joint before watching this
biden to old its mumbling
how about a goose egg
my father worked his a off most his life for what medications are too expensive and prices on everything has gone up yet illegals get to come on over and are furnished with free housing and benefits what is wrong with our president and government you just wanna look good while those who actually worked for a living suffer biden has done nothing for our veterans
biden is disastrous in his speech even in his body language he seems very nervous biden is finished and trump is the one who will win i am not an american but i follow us news a lot i have never seen a disastrous president for the united states like biden in my life he must withdraw from the american elections the world under bidens rule did not respect america even the iranian terrorist regime is no longer afraid of america because of bidens disastrous rule 4254
please let me stay im mexican
its always been more difficult to cross the boarders than then make it out to be ive had friends relatives a long time ago 2001 attempt to cross the boarders and died in the process itd almost sound like every time that i made a new friend from central america they would tell stories about people dieing on the journey over here ive also had people say the exact opposite but they were americans buddy told me how his dad crossed right into mexico and went to tiawanna
billyins and billyins of jyna
the way i immediately opened the comments after clicking the video
im not in bidens favor but also not stupid to let trump in white house go 2024 democrats
another thing is is that the supreme courts ruled it unlawful for texas to have the razor wire buoies and had them taken down
demoncraps destroy deceive
should have the three stooges music playing in the back ground
including japan and south korea chinas not so bad biden loves asia
biden actually was fairly articulate throughout much of the debate there were a few occasions when he lost his focus and mumbled his way through his answer anyway bidens policies suck
bidens got the intelligent immigrants votes trump will have the intelligent american votes
currently watching this on the morning of the 4th bad idea i wanted to celebrate our country with pride and joy today but after just about 20 minutes of this im losing all hope in our country what are we actually doing right now people this is all so disastrous at this point it feels like were all screwed i just hope we all snap back into fkn reality and create a better future for our kids but regardless of how things are nowhappy 4th to you all and god bless you
biden is lying country far worse under the democrats
that 1000 yard biden stare is he on drugs
you can tell biden was given a heavy cocktail of drugs before this so he could debate and he still did so poorly hilarious and tragic at the same time
bidens team is full of yes man for getting him on stage like thisthe guy cant even tell one story without starting another one mid sentence
i think there ready to listen and let people talk
just sound like a bunch of babys cry cry cry thanks your waste of time earned you one dollar when someone dies but that person living could have paid hundreds or thousands to do so much more if you could have supported the nation but its okay next generation will clean up the mess if we dont overdose on our pain an issue
worst president since carter is biden
when i see biden the famous line in the movie the 6th sense come up in my head
it was worse than i thought
trump is 100 ai
i wish i had 100 for biden saying by the way
i would have given biden a few more seconds when answering that health insurance question at the end period other than that trump pretty much outdoledhim
at least we beat medicare
they look and act like school children
5530 does he make up stuff as he goes

4619 i think trump should not have used the word criminal but thats just a laymans opinion
its like 2 little kids fighting in the playground a bully and a nerd
president trump was very presidential in this debate
biden doesnt even know how to pronounce kiev he said keeve how stupid is our president this guy is absolutely washed
everything thats wrong with bidens health their now saying that about trump thats the pot calling the kettle black embrassing his wife you answered every question shes definitely not forgotten how to talk to kids from her babysitting days he doesnt know what the truth is anymore hes lied that much also putin doesnt want war with europe hed rather trade with us its america thats pushing that lie
this its clear ladys and gentlemans put ur feelings asidetrump 2024
david v goliath aka dumpdump trump is boss

trump you need to rest too many lies get rest for the rest of your life and take it easy biden will take care of presidency
looks like some medicine they gave to poor biden to be such high focus this time some serious drugs sniff sniff
my o my i dont care about joe or donald i think that before joe biden donald trump was the first president in your history he was the 1st president who didnt engage in any war in americas history but this is to much for a swede like me biden are not fit hes to old and may i say probably demencia for the country who talk about themself about no1 in the international world let me asure that in these time you are the laughing stock
trump vs dead wood one is loser while another one is sucker whats a us president candidates
trump under this mans leadership what leadership biden gave no leadership a puppet cant lead
best comedy show
close the border
i like how he points to the stand like i got to go to tis one
i couldnt believe it who put biden in this spot who would think biden can make america great energy cost has triggered the inflation i remember that the gas wasnt a concern but then biden took the office hahaha
how either of these people ever became president of america is completely beyond my understanding is there no one in that whole country that can be trustedtruthful and most of all coherent dont get me wrong its the same here in the uk
two american presidents have been calling each other fools for two hours
up donald trump
mister trump on presidency again will bring union this time
matrix red and blue pills on the stage
happy 4th july president trump 2024
putin wants to destroy usa he wants trump to be president should be easy to put those things together but here we are watching his cult members rally
biden is the worst president ever in history of america
then biden why is my son still not getting va medical help bc youre a liar
if president joe biden remains in office until november it will be the first time in history that a felon defeated a sitting president
trump is a nice guy i hope he will win otherwise the whole world can fall into a chaos
youtube 2008 joe biden hes not what you want him to be now folks trump 2024
trump is my favorite president
have fun usa an be proud
these should not be our candidates when we have brilliant mathematicians in the hard sciences
we dont need biden anymore in america
up donald trump
since both of those say the other lie is there facts anywhere get independant fact checkers and remake this video to show only the parts of the truth opitions ruled out i guess opinions and facts dont always go hand in hand
so each is claiming that they have successfully addressed all the problemsso there must be an invisible hand instantly reversing all the great achievements they made
why does sleepy joe continue to lie i despise him do you realize this debate is set up to help sleepy joe sleepy joe still gets blown away trump24
even cnn is acknowledging how incompetent biden is trump is waaaay better for this country
americans you deserve another president like putin and there will be peace and prosperity on our planet
this two should be in home care
trump doesnt take any bullfrom any leaders of other countries biden must be scared when he meets them thats how i feel
trump is the worlds worst next to putin
it is quite clear to me this man biden has dimencia my sister has had dimencia for years and she is in a nursing home and he is going to lead the usa lol its a jokehe cant even string sentences together
really sorry for you guys in states having to choose one of these greetings from europe
not sure why i am watching this how i endup here and wha is happening the discussion between them left permanent damage to my brain the only thing i can say is please vote trump he is the only high ranking politician on the west calling for the end of war which is what really matters regards from eu and a country bordering ukraine where nato weapons are clashing with russian weapons and moving us close to ww3 thanks
and by the way
i cant even understand the current president
impeach bidenplease
this was the entire debate i waited until the last minute to see why many people said joe really messed up and had a senior moment and i never seen that ive seen him have a few senior moments in front of the camera before but not during this debate im stumped and pretty stunned by this someone please point out to me the senior moment or where he really messed up during this debate this isnt rhetorical im really asking for someone to point the moment or moments to me and fyi i dont want to vote for either of these candidates and theres absolutely no bias here
trump didnt lie here if you buy into that lame excuse to trump telling the truth that he must be lying then you are a lame lost cause open your eyes and wake up there is video evidence to back up 99 of what trump said you simply have to do research and find it do not take cnn msnbc msn abc cbs fox news groups word for it those news groups are all owned by the same corporation dont be lame and seek the truth
were paying everyones bills one of the realest quotes for our day
a liar debated someone intermittently lucid that forgets what question he was asked so just chooses another from the voices in his head considering the population of our country these two people are the best we have a convicted felon ran for president from prison in 1929 3 of the vote in 95 years we didnt change the law this time a felon may win both parties need to put forth qualified candidates that would serve with cognitive deliberation on the issues we face as a people and personal integrity go to the many debate fact check websites evaluate the candidates statements you will find the debate stage was effectively empty the debate topic should not have degenerated to porn stars or golf handicaps we need a bipartisan 3rd candidate we can all cross party lines to vote into office so our country will have the leadership it needs
its like david and goliath just the way they walked out trump is strong willed and biden is like a little puppy
theyre talking about golf but i dont think biden would even survive 18 holes probably get confused and wander off or break something during his swing
102 jumps to black colleges when he was talking about ecology and clean air
am from kenya 254 i think we can bring our president wiliam rutoyou wont believe this guys on talking he is very smart than these two gentlemen
100 groceries now cost over 400
i put my paperwork in for the burn pits and still havent seen chet guess my daddys gotta be a president
there is unfortunately so much hate on both sides of the debate
sorry biden how many kids you can in the border trump finished the war that barack obama started after one month pregnant abortion should be illegal one month is enough time to for the women to chose and think about war everything trump says is true and facts
even biden stops and listens to trump
let me say this again the price didnt go up 20 percent it went up percent
trump will disrupt the currency as saudi has pulled out of the petro dollar liquid gold key word
this is so embarrassing
3607 biden didnt see a ghost he saw 27
i think all joe biden had to do was be awake and he won did trump even say anything other than complaining
2226 this one counts for trump as a rare truth thats true all the time you will find terrorists from middle east coming to america and theyre 2 types the first type holding israeli citizenships and the second type are the other leaders of the other countries in middle east
biden looks bound and about to cry everytime he speaks
yes there where major wars that contained just to europe the napoleonic wars for example
the combined age of these two men is frightening
biden running off dial up trying to queue into the match
biden had his moments and trump did rant a number of times but all in all if democrat voters have only seen them both on cnn and msnbc then they must have been shocked at how gone biden is and how normal trump is
does biden know how not to lie
the american people dont care about jan6 its long been forgotten only the liberal media and the democrats keep pushing it as a big issue what we care about most is the uncertainty of the future under bidens administration
poor joe hes so old
the vegetable vs the suit easy win
92 percent said trump won the debate
new drinking game take a shot of tequila every time biden says and by the way
trump win absolutely
i smell civil warare you ready
im a foreign to usa but on a serious note those democratic party supporter should be really ashame im sure there are much better adult than joe so why elect him he can barely speak also to be honest i always cough to myself when biden speak seems like something stuck in his throat im not supporting republican either but between the two ill definitely vote for donald anyway it doesnt matter much to me but me and my sister argue better than their debate
trump let covid inn them china planes that landed in los angeles if people want to be blind about how dangerous he is say no more
i think president trump agreed to debate with this guy is because he want the whole world to see how senile joe biden is
make the one who is asking questions a president
the clorox conmans hand gestures whiles hes talking look so ridiculous
the presidency is overrated worry more about your own states governor
if you think that this is pathetic or funny just remember that this is democracy
none of the questions were answered
we should have early elections
so sick of bidens lies
issues discussed in this debate 1 inflation 2 national debt 3 abortion medication 4 immigration and border security 5 foreign policy 6 black lives matter 7 climate change 8 social security 9 childcare 10 opioid crisis
trump posted facts about the virginia gov saying kill the baby later they sell baby parts for money and trump just nailed it
why is biden always squinting with his mouth open
biden civil war trump prolly wont be biden higher prices trump prolly lower prices biden stutter problem trump firm steady voice i vote trump or whoever else is even better for america
123000 comments and counting all antibiden if he wins this election were being lied to
the rematch must be without microfone muting
the idea that joe biden
was joe biden speaking english
crimnals come from the middle east what about the criminals who killed whole countries once one saidkill one person ans youre a killer kill millions and you are conqueror the world is loosing its soul
wonder what comments will be when biden wins
biden half leg is already in the grave
yeah i remember when my grandad was dying and dementiaaddled he was so convinced he could still do things himself and refused help from anyone ill do it doggone it etc while incoherently rambling bidens cooked the best thing he can do for liberals right now is drop out but he has to do it now if by some miracle he pulls a victory this november in four years well be so crushed under this inadequacy well pendulum swing to the right and all trump or someone worse will have to do in order to win overwhelmingly is fog up a mirror
are you kidding me that they pulled this guy out of convalescent home and his facial expression the way he walks what is wrong with this world we gotta get this guy out of office because we know hes just a puppet and there many people behind him running the presidency
if putin is a war criminal then hitler is a whole diffrent being
how many time this old men have to say the idea
oh my god look at biden he was like what am i doing here
1900 biden is like thats not what i said
as a irish watching two grandpas talking about golf in a presidental debate was very funny
anytime its trumps turn to talk he instantly shoots down biden and goes on about the good that he did straight lying majority of the time
1050 aint bro the one whos a felon and running for president felons cant vote and can hardly get jobs and we can let him still run
he needs his beloved teleprompter or a cheat sheet lol
our country be been destroyed by president joe biden
a divided america i went back and looked at obama and romney debate you can note they shook hands and both smiled to the public
a discussion between two drohne killers and war criminals
this made me quite afraid of getting old man if i couldnt articulate my thoughts am i even having thoughts id want to be taken care of and just eat icecream and blink from one happy moment to the next im not a biden supporter but i feel strongly for the man
biden hasnt a clue of what hes talking about biden is a babbling many people running him he needs to retire find some love and peace
someone already outsmarted
they need to go head and let trump take office now im over this economy
what a pathetic hypocritical media cnn is
the issue with covid is that people are still suffering the aftereffects of that pandemic we could see a massive drop in population even years or decades out we do not know where that train ends we can offset the taxes americans pay with import taxes but we need to prepare ourselves for export taxes its time to come together and support this countrys best interests before there is no country to defend the question is the 2 party system working for anyone except politicians and the connected is it really please explain your answer on the incest comment that was poor form any assault is as bad as any other assault regardless of the perpetrators family ties or immigration status still girls and boys like that angel in houston may very well have been saved if we fixed our immigration system we have to fix the system there is no point in painting the walls if the roof has a gaping hole in it
biden looks lost in space trump looks strong and fit
who really cares about whos better at golf that doesnt affect my life in anyway
where are the policies spoken for the peeps
if you dont know whether youre voting for biden or trump then you aint alive in which case the dnc will be happy to harvest your ballot and cast it for you
bidean is saying good things but not stable to say firmly
34 felonies is just a felonious witchhunt
you got room to talk biden what about the open border
i dont trust neither its all talk whether they say they will change america its just their theory you want to ask anybody ask the congress senate their the ones with the yeas neas joe might of been slow with answers though trump never answered most of them neither more and more warehouses being built in america who is moving in them china why america will not have soc sec because robots electric cars todays computers will take american jobs i see more imagration on the highway construction and new housing with no americans today in the fields today
this is not a debate its a conversation about what they are not going to do if they become president
i am enjoying this comedy show
trump should do standup
im not american but id like to know what type of person would who would vote for biden
742 im no tariff expert but doesnt raising them just increase the price for the consumer and not the country that items are imported from edit also if theres a minimum age requirement for running for president does this debate not prove there should be an upper limit as well under the assumption that a leader of a countrynationnation state is the prime depiction of the people they represent both of the candidates are of retirement age and they likely should be and for those who argue that their experience level is what makes them eligible are they still the best we could find in terms of other factors physical and mental health perhaps
trump is still my president
and biden keeps saying the idea
ab ki baar trumo sarkaarvote for trumpfrom india
watching from india i believe america will be much better with trump then biden
biden sound like spongebob when he needed some water
enjoy your democracy enjoy your soap opera while your standard of living and western ideology crumbles around you
my face when biden talk
cnn criminals because where is jfk jr
the fact that the acronym maga is used interchangeably with extremists is very concerning does the left even realize it means make america great again why would that ever be a bad thing are the extremists trying to make sure were allowed to be foolish and kill our babies late term no are the extremists allowing their children to watch naked people dance in the streets in a name of equality nope so why are trump supporters hated so much is it because we yes i am a trump supporter i vote for who makes my life better simply dont stand for the idiocy that is the current office i know this was just a huge jumble of questions in the form of a paragraph but im truly scared at why people hate a man that doesnt want our babies to be killed wants our borders to be safe again and wants to drill for oil knowing we have some of the largest reserves in the world and would drive down costs exponentially
there was no inflation when i became president joe biden
mr trump is right we have to stop the killing
funny seems like to children fighting each other
this debate was to reiterate that it doesnt matter who our world leaders are because they do not run their countries anyway so stop playing the game focus on local politics focus on your families your neighborhoods and your communities greater is he who is in us our lord and savior jesus christ than he who is in the world satan
im italian and in this moment im just exploding with laughter no offense
25th amendment if a president is unfit for duty he must resign biden has early signs of dimentia
my forth captain is mike lions aryan brotherhood real prisoners
lateterm abortion only happens when there is a danger to the woman or child and with laws preventing abortion doctors feel pressured not to do it
they should have let them talk over each other it would be much more fun to watch
president biden is a liar
yall trump got this
trump has gotten better at public speaking
the joe biden antiamerican mental movement must stop immediately if you want to do the heroic thing and step down from president the american people will have to show him the door and tell him to go with what little mind and mental capabilities you have and enjoy the rest of your life
did i just hear putin say everybody trust them africa did not trust you usa
joe biden his had the mental issues and the mental decline before he became president of the united states theyve been hiding his health record and the real diagnosis of his problem joe biden also claimed that he would be a oneterm president because of his mental decline we want the american people to know the truth joe biden is not making proper decisions 3 years ago he opened the border and he opened all borders seashore and airspace here of late weve had nuclear russian submarines in the gulf of mexico and off the coast of florida these are antiamerican decision
why are bidens pupils so dilated
if i hear and by the way one more time
viva trump clean up the mess get us back on track
dear americans im sorry but this was one of the funniest things ive seen in a while clearly america needs fresh blood but in order for new people to appear in the presidential race they must first appear in congress and there are now mostly old people with a cold war mindset
lets go brandon fjb
of course he did biden administration is a disgrace
a cold take a drink of water and cold med jet lag fly sooner and rest dude u havent and cant led and defend our country
impeached itbiden now
we need a third choice
whats wrong with biden voice
i think biden had a major success with fighting illegal aliens tho
the only thing i take away from this debate is the millions of people have died under biden i want the wars to end i want a real economy not a bubble created by inflation i want american business to hite americans how could trump spend more in four years when he faced covid yet biden spent billion in ukraine so im for trump i know when trump was in my job was secure my bussness was secure i made more money in all my life im for trump
why is there only two candidates
same old things different day
was this edited
they are not answering the question they are only tackling the wrongs they both did
indian pm is afraid of doing live debate with anyone
can someone put biden in thriller video as a dancing zombie please
trump openly threatened to incarcerate biden upon his election during this debate biden is obviously unable to complete some of his thoughts this debate has made me far more discouraged by my options this election
biden is like the mall is open but no body is in there shopping
america 2024 presidential candidates both are senior citizens one might be convicted of treason the other might be diagnosed with dementia i guess it really doesnt matter whose president as long as their good at reading scripts
great job president trump
im from south africa and i find these two old men funny especially when trump said trump i dont know what hes sayin and im sure he doesnt know what he said biden
the opening of this from cnn lol basket of groceries 100 then now 120 yeah everyone believes that number is accurate
why wasnt rfk included in this should be a big scandal but no one is talking about it this country is doomed
who is better biden or trump
first question lets us all know they both answer to the same master biden could have easily called out the money printing during trumps term being the catalyst that drove up the markets the stimulus checks gave the boost post covid that money printing and giving out of free money wout labor returned is exactly what creates inflation the effects of expanding and contracting the money supply takes years to ripple out across the market they both know this and stay silent because they are on the same team
the face that trumps makes is enough to intimidate a competitor
i hate abortion but many states stop birth control pill i dont understand why any state would want to stop birth control theres to many women with kids they dont want and most of them end up in welfare which i dont think our taxpayers money should pay for these kids
south park should definitely make an episode on that golf off that was brought up at the end
god sent his son into the world not to condemn the world but so that the world might be saved through him bible john 31
the stupidity here we go leading the crocked way w cnn
americansdo you have other candidates or just this two old grands
president trump 100 joe 0and we have a winner trump
5839 biden got the pikachu face goin on like
i feel like im listening to children this country is absolutely doomed thats a fact
the left fear monger he says he would put back roe wade if reelected why didnt he already do it they love dangling that carrot and the left always falls for it 500 years in office and he hasnt done anything
this was a painful watch it took me 4 hrs to finish happy birthday america those that made it great are dead
trump would stomp this guy outthe weakness of r country rite now
i have to be honest i dont care if the president is republican or democrat what i care about is what the president can do for america i feel the same way about every part every branch of the government that being said this debate would have been better if they both would have stopped going back to past topics and stopped with the insults they both should have stayed on each current question
and can you say america isnt fighting a war when america weapons are being used in countries on the other side of the planet israel chiefly but anerica has been war hungry for a long time and foreign policy has to change before we hit a point we cant walk back from
god bless you
this debate trump spitting facts biden liar
biden talking about debt while throwing away tens of billions in ukraine and israel
i think biden escaped from the nursing home
this is getting very tedious
our group ask favor to president joe biden after e 1057 lected but until now still on the list if our group decided to help his rival i cant blame them coz their prayer until now not heard if still goes on not hearing our group prayets i cant blame them cpz rjey wait for four years w
there both terrible i want someone new in the office
im surprised trump didnt go after the exchange of griner for a russian arms dealer when he reminded everyone about the wsj reporter being held in russia11926
i cant even understand what biden is saying
i feel like nowadays every presidential debate contains people insulting each other instead of answering the questions made however these two take the crown
the economy is bad border crisis is bad and health care is the worst im a diabetic i dont pay 15 for insulin i pay much more money than that health care is much worse than when trump was in office
did someone hear the fart at 11625
im an independent but after this debate im seriously leaning toward trump
leaving nato north atlantic treaty organization could have several significant negative consequences for a member country here are some key reasons why it might not be a good idea security and defense collective defense natos principle of collective defense article 5 means that an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all allies this provides a significant deterrent against potential aggressors military support nato members benefit from the military capabilities and strategic assets of other member nations leaving nato would mean losing access to this extensive support network geopolitical influence global influence nato membership enhances a countrys influence on the global stage member states participate in highlevel discussions and decisionmaking processes on international security and defense regional stability nato plays a crucial role in maintaining stability in europe and its neighboring regions leaving nato could diminish a countrys influence in these areas and weaken regional security economic implications defense spending nato members share the burden of defense spending which can help reduce individual costs outside of nato a country might have to increase its defense budget significantly to compensate for the loss of collective security economic security stability provided by nato contributes to economic security and investor confidence leaving nato could create uncertainty and negatively impact the economy political relationships alliances and partnerships nato fosters strong political and military alliances among member countries leaving could strain these relationships and isolate the country from important allies diplomatic support being part of nato ensures diplomatic backing from other member countries in times of crisis this support would be harder to come by outside the alliance technological and intelligence sharing advanced technology nato members benefit from shared access to advanced military technology and innovations leaving nato could limit access to such resources intelligence cooperation nato facilitates extensive intelligence sharing among its members this cooperation enhances national security by providing critical information on potential threats historical and moral commitment commitment to democratic values nato promotes democratic values and the rule of law leaving nato could be perceived as a step away from these principles historical alliances many countries have longstanding historical ties and commitments to nato leaving the alliance could undermine these historical relationships and commitments overall leaving nato could undermine national security weaken geopolitical influence strain economic stability and diminish important political and military alliances the benefits of membership including collective defense shared resources and enhanced global standing far outweigh the potential drawbacks of withdrawal
i supported biden for president with certain conditions before if not agree d our conditions before polls our group may support donald trump
trump shat his pants at 11624
for me donald trumps must win again
the moderators gave joe time to respond to trump but anytime trump wanted to respond to joe the moderators prefaced it with a followup question before giving him his minute they didnt do that for joe
biden is the most horrible president and he doesnt care about anyone people are being killed by by all illeagls coming in her and biden doesnt care he can go on vacation 150 times and not care this mess
trump is the best
so according to them they are the worst presidents in the country
im scared this is our future
thinking that the united states can do anything is a bad idea
pelosi and her hubby kno all to well about trade they should be investigated i hope trump will turn it around on all these crooked politicians
from ireland i wish trump is your next president he speaks the truth i cant believe america let biden be a president hes got no clue whats going on
we are a republican nation iam not in favor of abortion period biden gots to go he is destroying our country iam not in favor of lb t g iam not in favor of open borders donald 2024
3527 trump has an interesting and peculiar expression here
13500 look at that
president trumps correct the fact that biden is even allowed to debate whether or not this man should be the president of the united states is outrageoushave we lost our collective minds president biden should have been removed by his cabinet under the 25th ammendment a long time ago his sharp cognitive decline makes him a threat to natl security this alone is disqualifying congrats to president trump on a strong debate performance theres really no comparison the choice is clear
brandon got bodyslammed trump is lucid on his toes youve got a mumbling bumbling dc grifter politician vs a true leader and doer
my god this is pure entertainment i never laugh so much in a while
if biden can debate he can also stand trial correct
joe stayed awake
biden needs to go to jail and all his puppets
3000 cnn reporter you have 10 minutes president biden biden mumbles for almost 2 minutes
it wasnt an insurrection i was a riot
there once was a man from nantucket and in front of him sat 3 plates one read the left one read the right the middle read the ununited states
hello from europe can someone explain why this two guysmore than 300mil people and just this two old guys i dont understand
and if you move israel use tracking chips only for the ones who have moved the ones born in the new place will be classified as new israelis for new israel tracking chips so both countries can keep track of the new countries people for if someone from israel goes over to the new country without permission can be tracked or seen by there country and so the country who brought them in can see when they cross there border and were they can be returned to new alarm for when someone crosses with out special permission pass port i can come up with all kinds of ideas but if youre going to bring in another country you might as well keep track of those people both sides so there are no problems and make it were you have to cut a arm off to get the tracking device out new land is about keeping every one safe things you might have to do for a new life with out war and till countries can get to know one another
well i learned one thing biden is better at than trumphe knows how to count to 3
when this thing happens in india
a disgrace and a laughing stock for the world to see a government with an incompetent leader is a vulnerability they should never allow their enemies to see
we were the finest nation we are a joke now this administration has us so tour up over what bathroom to use that way they can do what they want while nobody is paying attention and hes tearing this nation apart
it is still a huge surprise for me how biden became a president shame on americans who voted for him
i thought the 70s was hard now i have to say this is the most hardest time in history
cmon guys stop it lets face it joe won through out the whole debate cant you see joe was moving an inch here an inch there thats proof he still has a pulse might be here and there for a split second but still a pulse trump has no chance against joes people if not joes people michelles people or gavins people a gazillion zombies usps will need to hire an army to work the night shift this year
not a debatebut rather a couple of juveniles returning each others slightsits sad this is the best we have to offerjmho
still no one asked about social security unbelievable
past history what about now how are you going to fix it
120 dollars shopping basket vs 100 thats being kind visited america and was stunned by the cost of goods rip off
trump won this hands down
biden the idea thatfill in the blank
what is black jobs and hispanic jobs shouldnt it just be american jobs
4603 is that a background voice saying let him respond before he says do you want to respond
this man is truly demented
i have other posts were i mentioned it yes i dont use punctuations now picture how small israel is now by moving israel giving israel land to develop on in another country to where they can make it their own country on that land provided now in return that stops the war between israel and iran or israel iraq move them closer to allies if they attack israel anywhere else those nations in return protect that country israel with a atomic bomb each to iran or iraq or baghdad for attacking israel off there old land and to be taken as a threat as if there attacking their land in defence of israel now any country taking in israel giving them land to develop on after they develop on that land now you have a place tourist go to without war theres one way of bringing in money to their country new israel if they put their heads together and think they might come up with some better ideas for israel that would stop both sides from attacking each other completely cut each other off from trade where they dont deal with each other for anything any country that takes in israel both sides cannot go to war with each other has to be handled respectfully and like people no war from any side since it was to save the people of israel and iran from any more civilian casualties
poor joe should be at home just resting they need to let his vice run we would elect her to avoid trump any day
bro i couldnt watch past first question with biden that dude is the biggest liar trump 2024
look at biden face he just dont know how smart and faithful is our real president donald trump is our leader of the united states of america his so awesome mr jackol you are so a looser cant even debate the devil coming down thank you president donald trump you are gods chosen one i love you my president
trump is a much better option than biden for 2024 biden is not a god fearing man hes a politician
the only winner here is the wall street journal these views getting paid lovely
yes billgates and johnkerry climate control bill wants to but plug cows so they can not fart and i have no idea what kerry does
biden talking too fast to think
trump is the best
there should be an age limit however biden still makes more sense than trump
they let those people into the capital fact
there should be an age limit however biden still makes more sense than trump
god i pray that you give trump the power to become president this year and for him to fall to you for prayer i pray in the name of jesus amen
does anybody know how many times biden said the idea
1303 sorry he cant say bidens criminal who had over 90 criminal charges
best wishes trump biden need a rest
same type of debates must be held in india
biden just made me laugh out loud no president should ever seek retribution
folks who is better for usa
if i can extract themes from these 2 candidates i can see that trump is very focused on economics biden is very focused on equity both very good qualities but we need balance please utilize experts who can appraise and scientifically predict the outcomes of your strategies free from political bias republican and democrats need to work together to make our country happier the problem is that most of the incentives are based on republican and democrat interests very divisive let us solve problems by being objective
thats it were screwed
good one
trump is worse there isnt anything about him that is better for me this is entertainment
both of them have big problemstrump is indeed in a better mental state than bidenbut both of them are funnyfirst the two people have one thing in common that is they change the subject whenever the host askstrump said immigration several times in the whole video so i wont say moreeven if he answers a question seriously he will still talk about immigration in the endbecause this is his advantagelets talk about bideni wont worry about what he saysim most worried about whether he will suddenly die during his speechsometimes he cant even speak clearlybut he has one thing to be sure ofthat is he can answer some questions seriouslyim talking about medical and educational issues and so on these hosts asked themhe can still answer some of thesethen trump was involved in immigration and who is good and who is badthen they were like clowns againwhat makes me speechless most is who else they talk about playing golf wellif the host hadnt reminded them in time i believe they could have quarreled about golf all day
indians put the like
why are they talking about golf at a presidential debate great job america
ive never voted before in my life im 30 years old everyone must realize whats at stake here we are almost at ww3 look around the world
bidens prep should consist of hanging out with representative jasmine crockett hes gotta learn a thing or two about modern debate rhetoric
1153 covid i skibidi with
a 10 tariff would increase our averaged annual household cost from 1700 to 2300
the world laughed at the usa on jan6 it was laughter and a bit of fear seing democracy fall
i dont know what he is saying i dont even know if he even know what he is saying trump lol
biden and pelosi want to be right over all else i think cia had something to do with covid biden is holding on to those numbers tough
president donald trump is a legend if he cared about money or wanted a quiet life he wouldnt be running he cares about america and the american people along with his own family vote for this great leader and save the usa from the forces who wish to destroy it and its values vote trump24
lend and lease ww2 was 50 bil usd clean of inflation in 2023 thats over 800 bil trump liying again
watching this like reality tv man this is wildly unserious neither of them are saying sentences that make sense
other countries dont respect our leadership hate to break it to you donny but its been that way for 8 years now
biden should have had one answer in place for all questions asked biden no comment he would have looked alot better
who cares about golf how about accounting truth and accountability
did biden actually respond we are a child
vote for trump 2024
biden is the one who lowered insulin trump has said he will get rid of social security trump likes to say everyone else lies to deflect all the lies he tells
yt is corrupt biased towards elites democrats facts vote trump24
its like a boxing match
joe cant control his leaking depends but hell control the global climate with dictatorial ev mandates
why are middle class americans paying more than 6 of the earned income every time they get paid thats more of 18 percent of earned income is going away
bidens brain started breaking down 15 minutes in
groceries that cost 100 now cost 120 id love to find where theyre that cheap right now because its not in oregon
the guy is old jesas
i would hate to be on the battle field with joe
mind you 6 is not even cut from the middle class do better
everything is great now my grocery receipt detected that was a lie
trump tells so many lies he cant remember them all
no way this is our best candidates to be president in our country i think old geezers project onto joe that a senior citizen suffering from dementia can run a country this is ridiculous and proof this election is a sham i can find better candidates in my town for president than these two
to be honest biden was brilliant but had a slow start for his age and larger part of his articulation biden is surely better than trump
joe biden turned around what he has done and lied when he said trump did ittrump didnt have to steal and cheat his way to the top
mr trump is pch sweepstakes your hush money remember parental controls please
why oh why are these our options looking at our future is saddening and scary ive read 75 pages so far of project 2025 so i refuse to vote red but what person with eyes and ears wants to vote for biden i truly appreciate our government and our constitution and i dont think either of these men reflect or uphold american values i believe they represent the extremes of our nation not the middle and im extremely disappointed that both parties chose these men to run head to head again
if the republicans dont win america is done
i dont know much about american politics but i think its admirable how little attention trump gives to bidens halffinished thoughts and trailing off of sentences i think it says a lot about his character
can you imagine if an actual audience was allowed to be there
is it bad that you got to have headphones because biden speaks so low
imagine being biden and having to follow obamas exact same verbatim plan and trying to hide it as he constantly mentions him in everything and every speech he does but nobody ever takes the time to research the censuses cause its alll therr just saying ur welcome
this was elder abuse
can president trump request for a stronger opponent
note to democrats asufutimaehaehfutbw joseph robinette biden jr
biden is the winner he is smart and have class
props to the hoster too this has to be the best moderated debate i have ever seen
they keep sugarcoating this last election answer me this who and were are the dead people that voted for biden why not investigate that
debate dont determined president biden is the best
trump and hillary finished their televised debate very late and needed to eat something to replenish their energy they entered a bakery together but both of them found that they had no money on them hillary hesitated for a moment then took advantage of the clerks lack of attention and reached out to take three pastries and hid them in her pocket she whispered to trump you see how smart i am the shopkeeper didnt see anything and i dont even need to lie i will definitely defeat you and win the presidency of the united states trump said is it your usual style to act deceitfully and steal in order to achieve your goals in fact you can also achieve the same result in an honest way look at me so trump said to the bakery owner i am the republican presidential candidate trump and i will perform a magic trick for you to show me please help me pass this pastry to me the shop owner was very curious and immediately gave him a piece of pastry as he instructed trump wolfed it down and asked for another piece but also swallowed it then trump ordered a third piece of cake and took another bite into his stomach at this moment the shop owner was a bit puzzled and asked trump when the magic would appear trump replied now is the time to witness miracles the three cakes from earlier were all in hillarys pocket
equityyyyy is all joes doing
biden reminds me of that scene in transformers 2 when sam is going skitz on in the lecture room
pch chat we still on live feed great great what does pch have anything to do with trump or bidens campaigning and please dont forget you control your own parental controls on your technology were live in missoula montana they have sex offenders in this city have a great day and happy 4th of july 2024
i observed when the host asked a question at around 18 minutes pres biden was the first to answer and also the last to respond to that question it should be trump who should answer last trump wants to dispute but the host did not allow it i think giving the other guy more chance to talk more is unfair
federal governments job is not healthcare social security retirement marriage all personal responsibility issues we are personally responsible for ourselves when you put your responsibility in the governments hands youre f
joe is calling 81 million people liars and dellusional
joe said on videowe have set up the most extensive voter fraud system in the world
so biden didnt do well and trump lied about every issue tarrifs dont cost other countrys money they cost american consumers money exploding the deficit and the national debt jan 6th was not an accident the supreme court has been weaponized unfairly and the amount of russian influence in the 2016 election should help people to decide who to vote for sadly people who parrot fox news bullet points never read the mueller report the world is watching
wheres the third candidate
they wanted trump tower for migrantsand to destroy djt45 s character
trump was clearly better than him in this debate
remember the racism and black people were murdered at the 1980s well this happens again by cops they are killing arresting innocent citizens just because they dont like them yes sir this is growing on bidens era
taxing the wealthy produces higher inflation
i find it very difficult to believe that biden is only 81 years old my dad is 91 and he looks younger and talks younger and thinks younger
anyone in the world that watched this extremely unbalanced exchange of words has to ask themselves how did this man ever rise to the level of the most powerful position in the country and allegedly accumulate more votes than any president in history and i neednt specify to whom i am referring at this point and for the last 4 years if you make any effort to defend this persons credibility you have forfeited your own
these men both have led this country mr trump said years ago that he would never run for president how is it that a man with just 4 years of political experience just annihilated a man with 57 years of political experience the look on joes face says it all when donald speaks we have 4 months left until one of these men is gonna to lead the country for the next four years can you guess who its gonna be
joe couldnt even sell a used car
biden has absolutely no idea and neither do the citizens in the country look out for the further political corruption usathirdworldcountry
this reminds me of my brother and i i am honest and all he can do is lie when i call out the truth he claims to believe in god
trump poops pants at 11625 seriously listen
we the boys turned this debate into a drinking game every time joe says the idea you gotta drink
i wouldnt ever vote trump he sounds full of hate for foreignershe sounds really evil and purely xenophobic i also could see it when he was lying in his parts of the debate
i think joe thinks he is trumpand trump is him look in a miirror joe you dont have a reflection
the idea fake joe anybody keeping count of how many times hes said the idea
muted mics is not a debate
one is a lion the other a liar
this is so great because they dispise each other
the supreme court stepped up their game and gave trump immunity joe did not have that as a vpor pence
i will cheer the day the biden family escapades are exposed and convicted
under joe biden the criminals have more rights than law abiding citizens
what happened to joes 80000 irs agents
wsj does not edit the debate they do let it be raw footage the whole time
this entire debate was a farce like two boys in the school yard i was waiting for a my dads better than yours or a well your mom is so fat geeesh this is so freakin sad
they really shouldve had more cnn logos
everything the left has been doing and are preparing to do they blame trump for doing or is planning to do like jail political rivals
its really sad that he is describing everything hes done and describing himself hes blaming trump for everything that he meaning biden has done wrong
imagining putins face while watching this debate
kennedy trump an ant a roach poopiebiden
the democrats are the only ones saying anything wrong or bad about president trump
its joes warthey are protecting joe and hunters assets in ukraine including biolabs
he is bidena disgrace to america the world the universe
as a vet trump was right i dont like biden at all but he was also wrong i also hate trump
nice comedy show i absolutely love it waiting for the next episode
where are the missing children joe 400k is not a small number that is enough for a city
this is the first time seeing this for me
jesus i dont know how to proceed with my day after watching that
i cant understand anything joe says
respect to trump for standing there and listening to the lies coming out of bidens mouth
i vote diane feinstein for president at least we know when shes asleep at the wheel
as an european america is 100 cooked
the aim of being is to ensure stability and economic growth together with opportunities for people not cause people to struggle fairness and equality is fundamental saying this both men mean well work to create good change and peace im not a an american i live in sa uphold your motto and bring back the aim of the pursuit of happiness
why usa is unable to produce younger generation to contest elections
i love the open mouth blank stares of jbhes out of it
there was no inflation when i became president joe biden
can we call him mumbles
biden just mumbles incoherently i cant understand him or what he is trying to say he is weak
has anybody noticed that some comments the like counter doent work hit like and nothing happens always on good comments too yt shame on you
the most amazing line in this debate was trump saying lets not act like children joe
there are no gen z presidential aspirants in america america is left for grannys leadershipgood luck president trump
trump is the best
jeezthese are our choicesim sad for our country
donald trump looks and sounds like he cares about his country
respect to both these people for doing their best
joe blows
bro americas cooked
biden is lost pretty embarrassing
biden is making things up trump told putin to do whatever ever he wants
the us law has no right to enforce credit check for every single move normal people is taking neither should they have criminal check for people entering their country why because a criminal with such dark background is fighting conditate for presidency and president but normal people cant have a bank account or rent a place if they have a bad credit whats going on in this country
honestly cool look on both nice suits
time to watch this now
biden is hallucinating
biden has economics knowledge that of a child my goodness
trump deserves to be in office at this point
only hearing biden saynumber 1 number 2nothing much in those numbers
wait so for a guy that has always said cnn is fake news and now he is in a debate set up by cnn
a vote for biden is a vote for the demise of our democracy
biden is a friend of ruto in kenya he can look at your face and liehe thrives in lies his strength is in lies
man i wish i didnt enlist under the biden campaign the military is so soft now with him in control
age has caught up with jb trump has a great vision for us
trump please come back
what a shame it has a population of 350 million only 2 people are in the running for the presidency both of them are very old its sad for america
i watched the whole debate and i think the best pick for president is jake tapper
trump is alot more professional this debate no out bursts i can tell they mute mics but still he looks better
the only lead role biden should be offered is the role of norman bates in psycho the looks he makes
people have been saying for the last 2 years or more that hes senile and not fit to be president with fumble after fumble but none of the mainstream media covered it carefully edited those parts out now that they special juice theyve been injecting him with isnt working they have to admit it or maybe its all been a scheme to usher in someone else at the last minute
biden pls we need respect as american citizens dont ran as our president im voting for trump
trump handled covid perfectly
i want to peace only one of the world
president biden is murmuring and shivering what could be the problem with him he is not articulate and he seems absent minded sometimes he seems lost
is this real do u have a third optionor
its heartbreaking to watch biden
2626 my son was not a loser not a sucker youre the sucker youre the loser crazy dude that came out of a mental asylum
good luck to democrats good luck to america from france
trump does as is done to him biden is a continuation of day one when trump came down the escalator chitterlings of impeachment h clinton bought and paid for russia collusion not going to get into all now but has been a never ending onslaught for the last 8 years look at trump cool hand luke they lie he will lie back thats how you fight we are told biden cant be clear after 4 pm are you kidding but trump is clear headed after 8 years of every thing lawfare can do the condition of the world is the truth since biden what is better lets have a tangible truth and not some feelings not hurt better trump did a fine job and this debate for trump was spot on
theyre doing this just to get someone new i do wish trump answered some questions they should have asked twice instead of once and just backing down
biden is a warmonger he is enough to destroy the world we support trump go ahead trump
groceries from 2016 to 2020 150 2020 to present 350
americans support is also often translated as terror fear dead devastation hunger drugs who is a war criminal again
my heart actually breaks for biden he looks out of it sad stressed lost why are they abusing this man
i cannot believe that putin would not start a war if he respected a president he entered sochi during whos presidency
some people have forgotten that gods 10 commandments said not to kill there is never exceptions for abortion
i dont really care for neither but trump won when he came up w tons of illegal immigrants and tons of immigrants biden dumped on the black areas while guys like both dont rebuild or build new housing he just helped destroy biden black votes biden blacks or super predators votes just wont happen trump lied on obama be because his constantly jealousy but towards biden especially because of ww3 talk he won
cnn knew he had dementia they tried so hard joe but they cant hide anymore we knew joe wasnt running this country its a joke but unfortunately we are not laughing
mr joe biden obvious got alzheimers the way he look the way he act the way he speak you really cant hide yourself he is not the same person 4 year ago
443 biden says seniors can buy any prescription drug for 200 next year which us obviously a fake promise hes making to get elected but later in the same sentence he says all americans will be able to receive this what a clone
we are so cooked
did you count how many times the senior citizen on the right said the idea and were in a situation where the lack of capability he shows is astonishing
biden is like the internet explorer15 tabs open13 of them frozen and not having an idea where this fkn annoying music is coming from
why are elections now picking the lesser of two evils and not the greater of two heroes markiplier and jacksfilms would be better than either of the two
so sad to hear biden struggling to breathe and project his voice he should be checked for his iron levels being too low which can cause that breathlessness if i were in the us and had to vote for one of them it would be trump im not sure who you are voting for if you get biden who is actually calling the shots behind that man its not him his lights are on but no ones home most of the time
the rest of debates should be done on x 2355
im voting for daemon targarayen
theres nothing behind bidens eyes no ones home
im voting for trump bye biden you lose trump wins
imagine watching this and supporting either of these old bafoons
asked about economy and joe bidens answer is drugs
they just arrested 8 terrorist in philadelphia recently
trump said biden is the worst president because he cannot stop the wars in ukraine and isreal putin will never dare to attack ukraine if trump is the president
my president is looking indicted and sceard rather than being confident and its unfortunate
next election will be the most heated election of all time
i find it challenging to hear them speak let alone watch them speaking the manifestation of incompetency and immaturity in every possible human respect is just overwhealming approximated age of maturity definitely not more than 6 years more like 3 in a highschool debate they both would have failed no matter what they said and did they say anything else then he is the worst and i am the greatest they are the best of the best whom the us electoral system has been able to filter out to lead the country and this debate is when they supposedly pull their best resources together to win the presidency if these are facts and everyone can verify them here on screen then what must be true to make those facts possible if you ask me cnn or to be exact the powers behind it have decided to dethrone both presidents at the same time to give some new to be cooked up candidate a fighting chance that will be a candidate better equipped to do their bidding not a candidate to better reign the country
im from russia i think its embarras for u
i find it hilarious that trump has singlehandedly created a need for a mute button for the presidential debate for the first time in history
idk whos playing biden in this play but hes really good
just started watching this and it amazes me biden actually believes his own lies like most citizens dont have eyes
biden or trumpwho cares presidents dont run america
can anybody hear what joe biden is speaking after half hour
sometimes it feels like biden reading something despite the rules stating their words wont be influenced or that they wont be told what to say his eyes scroll slightly and sometimes he repeats the beginning of a sentence from two sentences ago as if he read a line before by mistake it happens 3 times i feel like this debate is heavily swayed in biden favor yet he still lost and all the media keeps playing it off like biden ysed his wit to corner trump did they watch the same debate as us
lets go brandon button
oh were cooked
he rewarded the wealthy sorry sleepy joe but i never seen 20 racks in my hand untell trump became president20000 and yall hated that i remember you wanted to send money to pakistan while trump wanted to give us even more unemployment instead of that and you said no pakistan first remember i do
america doesnt have someone decent to represent it
its the womans choice what they do with there bodies
trump installed border fence at texas biden removed it
ƒ±t is clear that who are the manage usa while presedents are standing like primary school students moderators is sitting
i fear for the state of the world if trump wins think hard before you vote america
heh i never had to pay more into fed tax out of my checks untill biden came it ive had to pay extra the last 3 years and my wages has remained the same hes horrible with everything
10528 that thank you biden shut down
bidden to just retire go and rest
it felt like i was watching an elder abuse
every single is a lie in all this
thanks trump for showing people that biden should be a felon as well thanks biden for revealing the truth that you use your affiliations to hurt people as it relates to bidens affiliations thats whats happening to me right now while hes the president i wrote the white house as it relates to crimes in my county involving the government and im being denied my rights to work receive benefits feel safe usage of electricity and etc through the government trump 2024
can trump speak a single honest sentence
no ways there must be someone lying between the two
there should be an age limit on leading a country
trump wants to deal with issues for the nowand biden wants 417 to deal with issues for the future of usa
why does biden looks like hes about to cry every second
so america couldnt come up anyone better than these 2 senior citizens i can not blieve that
lie from the start live it wasnt live it was 2 min delayed just in case biden screwed up
im middle class and i made way more money during trump than during biden
cnn and biden both suck
bidens all sentences start with the idea is that
the us are the biggest danger for us europeans you are pushing towards a war you want us dead
3333 you got the world wrong isarel invaded hamas in 1948 hamas said welcome to jews and let us live in peace they said ok many yrs later we saw the terrible war of isarel attacking hamas noteisarel wasnt a country back then they want to be alone thank me later war continues till modernday
the idea that this is the best candidate dems can come up with is outrageous
trump entry was awesome
greetings n well wishes for donald trump
ridiculous that someone like biden could run for 4 more years he looks like he is already finished trump sounds great for his age maybe because he never took drugs like alcohol cigarettes or other hard drugs in his life i respect that trump deserves 4 more years for sure from
clown vs clown
i am not an american citizen but can we have obama back
high level of democracy
shock question why are people so shocked that potus sleepy joe had a terrible night during the debate when clearly we all knew sleepy joe had dementia the only shocking thing is that how quickly mainstream media and others are finally taking off their blinders
hoping america brings the change it needs right now
not even from america but this biden dude is funny
one think that is just coming to my mind now is the russain bashing by the obarma the biden addmisistration and the hilery people they never stop bashing and bashing russian they try to link trump to russian and they kept that going all made up by hilery think about it they dont stop bashing russian or any thing about russia
2024elections potus sleepy joe has been lying to us the american people throughout his entire career and both thedemocrats and mainstream media have been shielding and covering up for him for years theyve been gaslighting us sleepy joe has dementia
im exporting a few stuffs to us and yes taxes went rocketing even my customer complaints that the import taxes goes up as well right after they cut everything in the final value fees i cant imagine about the macro economy theyre talking about in the debate guess people like me just trying much harder to serve a proper food on my table for the family no offense stop the war
the ref isnt biased this time do i sense hope
tapper is such a punk
fake newsyou were my favorite to go for daily updates and real news
world respect us he says not quite sure with that hard to respect a president who falls on the even places several times per week baiden is a new worldlevel meme right now even in this video u can see how he forgets how to speak and move his tongue
is this really the best you have america
i cannot actually believe this went on for an hour and no one intervened this country has gone to
ideally i would never vote for trumpbut looking how shockingly inchorent biden id vote trump in a heartbeat
well 23 years ago trump was not a politician but how did it show up 23 years later just another bullet more bulshit well then the president barack obama new about it and many more way before trump and biden
millions of people in america and these two are the best weve got
veto joe and let us know how great trump is
i see bidens lips keep moving but i can barely hear any sound out of it
biden is a sociopathic liar
trump only blaming he doesnt has any vision how things will pan out biden also hippocrates on wars both are losers
has anyone seen that movie idiocracy
all the very best wishes mr trump
guys this debate almost more than 90 mins you should respect thier age and allow them to sit to start debate the guys who are asking the questions they sat infront of president this is disrespect to them the debate pattern should change how many of you with me
once legend says my friend mr doland trump
trump is the only solution for usa democracy
at times like these im so glad im not an american
what else can you do with a guy who insists his boarder policies are sound then manages to tangent from abortion to an innocent girl being murdered by an immigrants his policies allowed in even credits hip opponent for going to the funeral
neither one has to win set up a new device for both to lose ground
just sword fight already lol
how sad is the state of america where these two senior citizens are the best we have to run the country
wauw trump went on cnn and still won
south park we are waiting
bro doesnt even even know where he is 2851
biden needs to save this humiliation and retire
advice of the day nobody should be ashamed of being a proud patriot there is nothing wrong with wanting to want to put your own country first america is truly the greatest country to live because were a welcoming country people want to experience the american dream
the idea that biden would be an effective president for four more years is simply not true come on man haha mimicking biden but how true it is trump cannot answer a question you ask him something and he responds with a litany of things unrelated to the question hes a runaway train
wow choice between a zomby and a harlecin we are and thats the world leader if i where putin i would also not respect nato at all
basically how this went donald trump presented something really good joe biden either looked at him very weird made a frowny face change the subject said all he said was not true then over exaggerates almost everything he said
biden took a nap at 2953 for bout 6 seconds tho no lie
if biden say the idea one more time
more comments here i think are more than people that actually vote not really obviously just funny
biden just quit and get into treatmenttrump for president 2024biden is the biggest war mongerafter obama and bill clinton trumps presidency was the most peaceful 4 years that the world ever had
if biden say the idea one more time
not one cough
no way he fell asleep 1519
bro really pulled 1519
biden is hippocrates on middle war and europe war biden will loose this time because biden is supporting war thats shame
oh no my good sir what happened to you
trump 2025 bring back incandescent keep tik tok
what a fuckwhit lucky to string 2 words together so sad regards from oz
1153 with the covid i skibidi with
funny faces of trump that is the face of american president if elected just like a child you need better leader come on get a great leader like you have in america before
when biden flutters his eyes like that and starts stuttering he reminds me of aunt clara from the tv show bewitched
a lot of homeless in america and drugs addict my freind shock while visit in america last year
biden needs to go to hollywood not be president
i tried not blinking my eyes competing with biden i lost he was on drug biden just lied and making things up he has no idea of any statistics of illegal immigrants entered into our country he has no inkling what the unemployment rate was when he took over the trump administration cnn never gave trump any chances to rebuttal she just asked questions right biden
any guesses on how many times biden said the idea
people make fun of both of them for not answering the questions but it was cnns fault for not allowing them to rebuttal the other person thats how a debate works
you know when trump is honest by calling biden as nd all of his bs at 5820
joe biden they said no no
spread that global democracy enslave us thru taxation and defend other countries borders
the j6 makes my blood boil with ole lieing joe pres trump said peacefully patriotically i hate the way hes treated pres trump the j6ers the biden crime familyeveryone of them 50 years bidens done zero for the amerucan ppl
biden is coldhe is not doing well
me wsj disrespect without disrespecting me wsj
bro i said ill have that war settled before i take office he said that with confidence
biden keeps telling the tv audience to watch out for trumpbecause biden cant stand on his own policies
its amazing debate but i should be request bought of him stop the genocide
biden aint really answering any questions all i hear him saying is and i quote aheiritogkddndh dueieioe i ebe ujejejeki nckidirj djkei euebbjei end quote
oh please dont vote for trump
its like 2 kids fighting for a lollipop
and why they give biden a minute to respond
legit arguing about who would be a better golfer in a presidential debate whose dad will win in a fight next debate
being an indian i love ex president donald trump he is such person as compared to criminal biden
joe showed us the art of sleeping with your eyes open
laughing from australia
i feel so bad for biden not fit for work but you americans put him in the office
biden you invented inflation
congratulations everyone we beat medicare
biden if god loved a liar youd be number one on his list
bidens face when trump mentions how they left afghanistan
bidens smile looks very cute like a child he is of a very old age but doesnt have the strength he moves his head from side to side very comfortably anger was never seen in the debate
so you mean to tell me that this guy is the only guy in america that has access to nuclear codes and has minutes to make a decision if something were to go off
thats a lot of pauses for biden
i am from europebut i dont know why americans vote for biden we all see this man is criminal and mentaland have bilioners behind his back trump
brothers sisters and in laws
why is cnn hosting this debate
president trump you said in a certain video that we need jesus in this country so come back and give us jesus then remove all lawlessness so that the lord god almighty our father should forgive us remove disasters and heal our country john 33 niv 3 jesus replied very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god unless they are born again 2 chronicles 71314 niv 13 when i shut up the heavens so that there is no rain or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people 14 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven and i will forgive their sin and will heal their land romans 10813 niv 8 but what does it say the word is near you it is in your mouth and in your heart that is the message concerning faith that we proclaim 9 if you declare with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved 10 for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved 11 as scripture says anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame 12 for there is no difference between jew and gentilethe same lord is lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him 13 for everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved
the saddest thing i have seen in a long time just because your rich doesnt mean you should be president we need intelligent people to be leaders all i hear is blaming the other guy nothing good from either side guess the usa is off the list of places id move to from canada as we are fooked as well i think my cat would make better decisions
1027 correct the us looks like a muppet show for us old europeans
people who think that us has a racism problem need to get out of us and check out other countries
people please reply on this when it was the last time you had enough essentials for 100 at least toilet paper few eggs and chicken and maybe shampoo for your kids to take a bath
gottal love how every single solution biden has is raising taxes
a tale of two dinosaurs in a bout of bickering
from a policy standpoint biden is the only choice the felon trump should not be running
from 100 to 120 be real is more like 250 why lie so much i know people is with me on this one
that he know he should cut it
biden trying to bring up morals about relationships while his current wife was his 14 year old babysitter when his first wife died is hilarious
it was right out of the polity of beasts life reflecting fiction
just read through the comments and you will see the real approval rating for trump vs biden
sir biden rest relax and retire dont run for presidency anymore not to ruin usa and your allies
this is terrible trump just says whatever that comes to mind meanwhile biden says nothing at all
theyre really gonna make me vote for joe biden im going for anything but trump at this point man
almost everything biden says is a lie i watched 20 minutes ive heard enough professional liar fjb
i recently watched the debate between trump and biden and was struck by the realization that theres nothing new in politics except for the media coverage and its influence on voters politics has always been a horrible nasty business driven by emotion lies deception and the hope for a better future its baffling that in our civilized society we still need these gladiatorial showdowns reminiscent of the roman colosseum where blood and guts seem to be what the masses crave despite this i believe we will survive as an american society weve endured much worse and are still standing however if we fail as a nation the world could be thrown into chaos it is crucial for our sanity and the worlds stability that we remain strong and united
shame on cnn for denying the viewers and voters the right to hear bobby kennedy the right to participate
they need to fact check all this live
dealing with the covid look uhhhh we finally beat medicare mr trump its ur turn
they really gonna make me vote for joe bideeeennn joe bideeen why is the best case scenario joe
senility and being senile are oldfashioned terms that doctors may have used to refer to dementia some people may use senility to describe a decrease in the ability to think concentrate or remember a contemporary term that doctors use is neurocognitive disorder which might be either minor or major
you see biden stagger out then you see trump stride out in that second you know the winner
i dont think that joey knows what democracy is even about
i used to be a whiner and a wineo ª a whinee a red whiner n white whiner dang
they both have soulless eyes theyre probably clones or robots
technically trump should win the elections
is that his phrase of the day the idea
childcare for anyone cut in half give me a break oh boy a 10k tax credit buying their first homes when the house costs went up 23 times thank god i bought my house in 2017 and refinanced in 2020 under trump at 325 for a 30yr people cant afford to live now current home loans at 8 are setting homeowners up for a default property tax has went up insurance has went up for the middle class
atleast trump knows how to lie with charisma
first he blamed inflation on price gouging then blamed it on putin now 3 years later its trump hes gotta go
trump said my retribution is going to make this country a success because its a failing country and i quotethe man wants to make our country a succes mesning he doesnt care about joe he wants to get americans great again trump2024
100 groceries now 120 are you fing serious mine went up much more than 100 you clueless elite
are any veterans here living like what biden says please comment
trump has alot of common sense i dont know why some people dont appreciate that in him he is very quick in his reaction intuitive and determinationwhile biden seems lost most of the time the man is old yall need to give him some rest
lolive seen your swing ya his handicap isnt a six lol both of them are lying at times great debate made me laugh
i normally dont watch presidential debate but this one i am at 1833 it feels like watching family guy vs simpson
what an international comedy of the year 2024
joey you dont care about anythinganybody but yourself
what is the probability of the idea that by the way this debate is by the way the idea that by the way the idea that
how on earth there can be a president candidate who can barely even speak anymore
i dont understand why theres such a fuss biden is running against a convicted felon yet no one is calling for trump to withdraw democrats should chill out
when you are weak so will your military thats how it is biden
is he still reading from a teleprompter
biden will start a military conflict with russiachina trump will start a trade war with russiachina which one would you pick
trump does not look 78 i might have to stick to his diet
biden mhhfiusgh trump i dont even know what he said at yhe end of that sentence
brain dead joe actually did better than expected
i dont want to vote either ones theyre both not qualified for president
i dont want trump to win i will not vote for for him sorry
this is comedy
talking about grocery lol my grocery went up 100 bag of chips got smaller and price got higher
who else just dosent want either of them as presedent they both spent more time argueing with each other over frivolous things rather than answer any of the questions asked by the american people why cant we get someone who will acctually be alive to see the effects of there actions in office to run for president i hope that this display of utter incompitance by these two will change the veiws on our government and get more youth to start voting for there future not just internet clout wars between liars in suits may god bless us all if either of these two are are really our only options to choose from as the face of our country
3rd time voting for trump2024
dr phil visited the border he interviewed borderpatrol
the whole will run away from america due to such current administration of biden biden instead of being the worlds president started to divide the world by taking sides to support only the countries that are nato members this means the rest of the world that is not nato is going to be brushed off and that is unacceptable before such actions to happen
trump was very very very good
im a military veteran and i always hear thanks for your service but this country treats me like a third hand citizen
cnn is a farce
vote bin yall need to read 2025 bill trump made it up
yall should go watch the dr phil and trump interview trump is not a bad guy
this isnt the final debate
biden is a pinata after a birthday lol
its very nice i like it very much
the immigrants are getting our social security we paid into it
if trumps departs which im not against but here goes threefourths of my my neighborhood i agree that our country has become a thirdworld country now in the eyes of world
if you listen very closely at around 1 hour 16 minutes and si many seconds when trump is talking about tariffs it sounds like joe crapped his pants i thought it was him swallowing but its not ive watched it like 5 times
these guys are just blaming each other instead of talking about issues they be like hes the worsthes stupid the other no hes a lier hes dumb
trumps face when biden called him a whiner truth hurts
biden is lying 100 he does not know what he is saying
communist news network contact with campaign staff will not be allowedexcept for the earbud that is implanted in joeys ear for communication with barry obama
bonnie sando is for be the president bye to the lord trump cannot be a president we all will die we will start a war bye to the lord we have to be together jump was a mistake bite to the lord you you understand we cannot sell an hour brother instead to the corporation wake up trump cannot be a president bye to the lor bom bonnie sando its to be the prison
all i heard from biden was the idea
its fun its awesome
there is so much to hear between both candidates i am 20 years old and have never been so intrigued in politics in my life wanted to watch this debate because i just wanted to see how joe biden would do and i knew he was not gonna compete well enough i do not like biden for he destroyed this country trump did great as my president he is not a close person in my personal life so why should i care if he did fcked a pornstar all those years ago and if he lied about it so what i do not know the full story of jan 6 but we can not just sit here and listen to he said or what she said apparently jan 6 was really bad people got hurtkilled and trump did nothing about that but i have not looked into it to see proof or what but again how can i trust that info when i cant even trust what i see on yt or whatever i dont know what is a lie and whats not but what i do know is that everyone is now in complete shock when the see biden on stage by himself completely fail at his job how in the world did the dems not see this coming trump did his part and in 20162020 there were no wars there was no inflation my dad was not struggling this much i heard nothing about the border or afghanistan i just wish people really take a look at this debate and see why trump would be a better president i would rather have a person who looks strong and can talk and also has a past of doing great things i just wanted to rant because i am truly scared if biden or any dem under that biden party wins
bonnie sando is for be the president bye to the lord trump cannot be a president we all will die we will start a war bye to the lord we have to be together jump was a mistake bite to the lord you you understand we cannot sell an hour brother instead to the corporation wake up trump cannot be a president bye to the lor bom bonnie sando its to be the prison
are you serious we are the ones that provoked the ukraine war we were the ones that said we would never go east of the nato treaty
pick the best devil lol
honestly i started with the comments who are with me
the corporate blues and reds
so bidens media spins untrue salacious headlines and he just regurgitates them during a debate he has yet to present any solutions to problems our country faces under his watch
america is interesting if putin is a war criminal when he is at the receiving end of nato trespassing what does that make america who is bent on making ukraine a nato colony against all border and regional security control agreements
neither candidate can put forth a persuasive argument on any topic its so sad
joey you lost me the first moment you walk on stage because you lied about everything
does anyone else think joe biden had an ear piece in 5010 mark joe to me clearly is listening to something else and is shocked to hear it
3130 theyve lost 500000 troops biden says his mind is gone he didnt have one coherent point the entire debate not one
trump administration did have the best numbers for climate i believe its true because of covid every country had the best numbers for climate
i legit want to see them golf it out how do we make this happen
this is like watching a dog vs a tiger the fight isnt fair
trump biden also did anyone else hear biden pass gas or was it just me
bro this is america lol
joe putting the dem in dementia
trump is just lying lying lying
2226 brandon just speak to them
my president trump
bidens face during this whole debate
theyre both terrible options
love my father donald trump
to be honest i dont know what biden had been doing in the past 4 years
its not yours to fight f0r ever was and never will be
felt like trump was a lot honorable than biden
a new generation of politicians must arise the good old grand parents are loosing their tracks and have no idea about new world and challenges all we saw in debate is enmity towards one another and baseless rhetoric and overhyped minimal achievements
1843 how is going to restore roe v wade hes not that is a blatant lie if it is restored it wont be until the democrats have a majority in scotus which will be at least two decades if ever
never was yours and never will be wh0 land is it
the idea
this is so embarrassing how we going to vote none of this gentleman are even good enough to run this country we live in debt and this two crook cant lie even in front of us live tv millions of people watching we are a big joke to others country
you have the morals of an alley cat joe biden
i am not an american nor do i live in america i hail from way across the globe andif i were to choose trump it is
did crooked joe biden even take a drug test bro sounds high asf
im portuguese and i am scared af i laughed more than a few times while watching but then i snapped back to reality after realizing what had happened and now i dont known whether to be terrified into oblivion go into warrior mode or into a nietzschean nihilism crises
i would love to have a president who isnt red or blue for a change
this man has to go he said no inflation his economy is the best what planet is he on vote trump
the world is watching america unfold
militarism what a waste of money
why was cnn chosen for this debate give me a break
fake news cnn
joe talking like he aint already in office you been here for a min now joe thi√ü aint new
what will happen if usa elects a young president and must it be democrate or republican each time arent there other partiesjust asking
takes a real man to apologize
biden got roasted like a thanksgiving turkey which reminds me does anyone else remember when biden was sent to pardon the turkey as tradition calls for and he asked if it had anything to say
american democracy is completely destroyed by joe biden
trump absolutely demolished sleepy joe so badly that the dnc is looking for a stunt double
cnn you fake news taking bidens side u fake news at its best
if you watch this side by side with the 2012 presidential debate between obama and romney its like going from shakespeare to idiocracy
is biden with dementia
so enstranged wifey america had to date biden to realize that they made a mistake divorcing trump now wifey wanna take back hubby
if im elected thats what im going to do im going to restore roe v wade shows how little he understands about government
has anyone noticed that biden looks alot like walter from jeff dunham
it reminds me of snl alec baldwin jim carey great actors in their skits but that is what is happening in 2024 again just pure comedy
okay ill leave it simple like this when trump was president everything was alot cheaper gas food and everything else as soon as biden became president everything went up cant people see that why would someone want someone in office thats gonna make stuff more expensive makes no sense
so 2024 were really doing this again biden and trump really really move on
cant understand a word biden is saying
omg what biden has to go he cant even speak what a scary thing he could never ever make another term bye biden
raise the taxes so they can send it to ukraine wow joe
jeez joe realy no wonder my country is falling apart because they have friends like you go trump all the way the world needs this man
this cant be real its worse than a nightmare worse than a bad written comedy an announced tragedy indeed feeling deeply sorry and embarrassed for all the people living in the us would be better to have no choice than choosing between these two unbelievable and surreal and unfortunately it will affect the whole world too what a mess
bro saying raising tax on the rich to 24 to 25 percent just to save a billion dollars over 10 years hows about cutting that 8 billion we give to israel every year
look at 2020 debate vs this one bidens decline is stark and drastic
biden is so roboticso going off topic and rambingits concernng and painful
wow as a sitting president biden should not have said anything about the greatest economy in the world
at least biden can still count to three
biden baught controlled by china
mr trump is extraordinary with a quik and smarth answers mr biden poor thing not only he cant speek clearly also got lost in the medal of is 12 ansers he should be home enjoy is family
biden is a liar
the enemy of art is the absence of limitations these people have none
guilty biden
if biden grew up so humble then why is he destroying his roots
content is very interesting and awesome wow thats really good
if joe wins again ww3 will happen no one respects biden thats why those countries did what they did they knew biden would do nothing
trump again digresses from the question on russia and ukraine though he was redirected to same question
why does biden start every sentence with the idea that
warnok and ossoff
yall over there at cnn shouldve had the bouncing ball go word to word when president joe biden was talking tee hee
3300 the sound you make when the puppeteer accidentally slips a finger in the wrong hole
i ask god to bring mr trump back
trump was asked his he would accomplish deportation of all migrants he promises to deport he digressed talking about other things
joe bidens brain is searching for wifi most of the times did he know that is useless
they cant buy groceries anymore he just sends a black or hispanic to buy his so out of touchboth
a classic i like this show i watched it many times
this is not a presidential debate this is laughin
a real sophies choice
biden starting every statement with the idea is so dumb and embarrassing for him
he sold are major energy resources to people in other parts of the world he is a disaster he left us wide open to get abused
read the comments theres no way biden is winning the election without 2020like mass fraud biden needs to drop out for the democrats to even have a fighting chance
our president clearly has dementiathis is scary
why do i have a feeling im watching another south park episode
the only convicted person on this stage is the one im looking at
3555 why biden looking at trump like he seen him like that
the 46th president poor joy aaaaand the next the greatest the legendthe one and only expresidentdonaldjtrump boom trump2024 the 45th 47t president of the united states of america
even if you hate trump how can you support biden for president after clearly knowing hes seriously ill he will lead your country without being capable of having basic cognitive functions this alzheimers or dementia will get worse quickly and if youre honest you must know that deep inside it is very likely he will not survive the next 4 years in office this is cruel towards every citizen who will suffer the more his brain will start shutting down and it is also cruel towards biden himself for having to spend these last years he got left being pushed to cling onto power instead of spending it with his loves ones this is sad
my dear american friend why a president neet to good at debating is he a leader or a speaker
biden the idea blah bla shut up he reminds me of a narcissist
wow trump really wants to be a dictator i can sooooo smell it
god help our country both of these candidates are trash what a pathetic future
ask trump about racism in this country
make prank about moon landingfool to all people on this earthyou all liersee how rich will swipe you all
1153 covid i skibidi with
you wanna start a nuclear war trump shakes his head yes
said the idea by biden is not his but black obamas you know what i meant for
let biden rest people who hates trump love war ukraine israel all because of the failed leadership of biden people of america you listen to celebrities they are paid to act they do not care about normal people wake up vote for trump
a ham sandwich would be a better president than either of these two
president biden is the best we have hes in top shape
heres the deal
hey can we say war machine on each side
they should have given biden some hydrocodone cough medicine i felt better on it while sick than i normally do its that good he would have destroyed trump
is biden a alive i think hes dead
can we agree we are at a middle ground with no leader who can see past these lies
biden didnt go after his political opponent the judicial system did trump tried to overthrow our democracy with a failed attempt of a coup
can we agree we are at a middle ground with no leader who can see past these lies
im not from the usa but i can see politicians arent very different from each other no matter what country theyre from dodging questions blaming the other one hypocrisy and the thought of they being unable to make mistakes standard procedure for the brood of vipers described in the bible
cnn turned down bidens microphone cnn allowed trump to lie about bidens administration and then they dont allow biden to respond
the biden 4 raven 23 13 dead afghanistan 64b loss to the taliban
the real people in power are laughing hard at their comedy special
i was suprised that cnn were professional i thought they were going to be disrespectful toward donald trump cnn is the worst iliberal channel
by the waybye
only us president in recent history to not start a war vs a president who did worst job of withdrawal from afghanistan
houston we have a problem this is houston say again please the eagle can not land
jimmy carter 2024
dems its over no election even needed no way biden will win this looks like a snl skit
i feel bad for president biden i dont see him being the president for another term he needs to chill out and enjoy his golden years i dont know him personally and i was underwhelmed by him but he is but a mere mortal and needs to be taken care of by his family instead of being pushed into another term by them
criteria only one who not take fund from aipac can contest in election
ok clearly trump won and i definitely prefer him to become president but one smart thing joe said was that major wars in europe dont stay in europe he of course did mess this up by making it an absolute but i still liked it what do you guys think
mrs biden you should be ashamed of yourself i wouldnt let my husband go thru this
why there is no such debate between rahul and modi
this hole debate was trump lying like there is no tomorrow and joe biden stuttering all over the place
trump won the debate joe biden is clearly not well he has some sort of dementia he is in cognitive decline its worse since he became the president his wife is a liar saying joe is just fine donald trump did not lie joe couldnt even remember the debate from the day before it is really sad that his wife and the government is letting joe jeep going when its obvious that he is not well jill must be greedy
trump is talking facts
me why his chin dented in my gf its the negachin she black
at the beginning he said the wealthy only pay 85 percent tax then at the end he said they only pay 1 percent how are people fooled by democrats people say trump lies but cnn said biden told 34 lies during this debate
trump sound so informedbiden sound lost
hey biden looking dead as ever
murrica where are ur best young harvard or stanford graduate who run their own business and became senators u gotta have at least 1 why these old grandpa took the stage again
brandon worries more about ukraines borders than he does our borders
trump will win the election
bro im losing brain cells from this this is just the worst debt i have seen
the only sacred obligation fjb
number 1 gibberish number two more gibberish number 3 complete gibberish
im not gonna lie biden looks like he is solving the hardest problem in math 3122
donald you love the yankeees
a basket of deplorables went up more than 20
what was that sound at 011625 was that what i think it is
we dont want biden to win just because we dont want our country to be a battleground
cause use will put everyone in hisdtory ppl in jail and thast means walls street and all others
its amazing that they left the comments section open that being said we all know what this is its just a matter of if youre willing to lie admit you lied or admit you lied and that you voted for this guy
the only thing i want trump to do is stop lying
hope you guys dont even strtrar for us to bail the bwnkers again
no way bro just called trump a loser and a sucker 2628
the infant president is the bestmy applausebecause his place is in mental hospital
old pallet and lumber yards hiding criminals containers there is just seek
real biden or jim carrey
criminals hide in abandoned vans trucks old buildings dance halls big parties and parades attics basements diesel truck and truck yards trailers and old rvs sells and buys drug sex trafficking
biden starts his explanation with number 1 and he never mentions number 2 and he ends with another thing entirely
biden looks like a baby and he is really the baby because he is a grandad with childish dreams he actually resembles an infant
congratulations trump for becoming president love from india
he forgot his pampers
the amount of times they said black im annoyed
yhings are happpenin g in cuba and venezuela and biden has done nothing
i love america and to me america is the country that if i coulf go fith for this coujnhtry i would
what are black and hispanic jobs
what are black and hispanic jobs
although biden was a cadaver this was a masterclass by trump in destroying your opponent lol
so to let all the ppl know in case of war do we save the word or we save the miklitary and the goverment not the country or do you have save houses for all americans
addicts and drunks are the true abusers ministers as well who can we trust and many school teachers cops stop crimes stop corruption gang members move at night hours and operating slow in day
first thing i noticed was president biden wasnt muted coming on but trump was 249
this country was built on imigrants ands still does
baloney i own an excellent small commercial and highly qualified lock and security company in san diego ca it was cranking under trump after 2020 and biden we continued and have always done well grossing over 1m a year but the train went into a bit of a ditch business slowed down theres no reason for a lock and security company to slow down if you think about it and then theres the current governor of california and the jerks in sacramento who want to gut me as a small business owner my company was way busier when trump was in and everybody was running and gunningwe were running like headless chickens the commercial and industrial market was hammering my customers had money and plans theres still good construction going on in san diego but the interest rates inflation and regulations and whatever else have an arm around the neck of a company like mine i think san diego may be the the most active in southern california more than la orange county and riverside county for projects and opportunities but biden and newsomego buy a couple of vans and live down by the river
you know what this is going to do is civil war
joe you hswve done done nothing in 4 years and were not going basck to obama care
as a foreigner i cannot understand how in the country with so many talents the candidates are two retired grandpas i cant believe this is the face of the nation ps bidens participation reminds me of the last match of the mohammed ali which was a crime imho letting biden take participation is a crime
i find it hilarious how biden always points at the podium when he walks on to a stage
war again is the answer i believe because children are dying in america
sloppy joe looks confused petrified disgusted guilty slow and dead all at the same time
how come united choose biden as a president the guy is tired and old he doesnt even know what to say
you both need to understsnd thst thids nation was built by hard working ppl america has been built by natives and imigraants you both are hipocrats but theres no were else to chose
thank god there is no stairs biden
already struggling to find this on youtube
everything was rocking good djt
lets settle this debate with a lie detector test
trump or biden or whoever the us govt policy are all the same war weapons
god save the king
trump definetly seems more composed but he just keeps bringing up the same vague arguments rather than actually addressing any arguments
biden is the worst president of the worldhe deserves this superaward
hopefully the next debate will ask if there would be a federal tax exemption for descendants of america slaves
nothing would any president of the world do to afghanistan because this is the residence of devil
they asked so simple questions and didnt challenge trump at all
cnn tends to forget the violence surrounding the trump termalotof radical supremacy surged violence that was fueled following trump
biden is toast geez that was embarrassing for our country
im not american select the best president you need you know how trump ack as a president mmh careful again
respectfully god bless the united states of america
this country is over its so sad the illegal immigrants are in and keep coming in and its too late now biden has destroyed this country worst president in history its a tragedy what is happening
well done now this is the american way
oh know trump is scary president a lots of people dies on covid he dont care
i keep asking my self why they trying to control how maney kid you have and you call yourself free
question 3751 would you support creation of palestine trump 3813 the european union doesnt buy our products
yes he did and he was drinking champaign with his family told his daughter they are doing this for me
neither of them are appropriate candidates wake up
isnt it a bit obvious that bidens words are not his own the guys clearly repeating what his hidden microphone is telling him to say
next a boxing match
its like his voice is stuck in his body also these are both terrible candidates for president if this is what we have to choose from then there isnt a point in voting
they need to dingle an ice cream cone infront of joe to keep him focused
stupid debate sorry our country is in big trouble need to hear more about what we are going to do to fix this mess and we the people know we are broke 35 trillion if not more in dept a real problem that needs addressed not a bunch of bull we have heard over and over
imagine voting for a convicted felon though
he did beat medicare he beat it to death
they let the umpa lumpa talk for ever but sleepy joey cant talk at all this is like a lil kid arguing with his grandpa
biden couldnt pass a kindergarten level exam i bet he forgets what the name of the country hes running is
remember aunt clara from bewitched shes back
the two honored candidates are debating to serve the systematic leadership that their immigrant ancestors created
12358 i thought they were supposed to have the mics muted im glad they didnt because this was hilarious id pay big money to watch them play golf in a heads up tiger woods handicap is a 65 haha
if us only have this 2 options then theyre doom either way
doesnt matter biden has been selected again to win the reelection bid us is so phucked
nice knowing you america
president trump gave up his salary as the president of the united states and donated it to charity you still keeping your check
trump was the president before biden fd up united states
trump is more afirmative
we support trump from india
do you remember who bail al the bankers and after they wae celebrating in vegas that is what obama did
trump manage covid and he created jobs
biden handled himself and carried his part of answering questions a lot better than trump did too often dismissing the question with a review of what biden said or did wrong if trump had not have dismissed so many pointed questions i would almost be swung his way looks like i am going to have to back to ignoring the faults of the man both of them and stick to my points as an independent about the issues that said i dont agree that bidens age threw the debate for his campaign
afghanistan is the most embarrassing thing in our countries history what about slavery the genocidal actions carried out by the usa government against indigenous people women being considered property if you ask me those are among the most embarrassing and disgraceful things in usa history
that was obama work
go brandon go brandon
does he have a cold the president maybe they should give him lime or lemon with honey warm they should use castor oil in their hair
we need young leader
biden doesnt know anything trump should run again
what trump did to help the veterans was so much better than what biden has done biden has very little respect for those of us who served i know this as i am a 100 service connected medically and honorably retired and disabled us army iraqoif operation iraqi freedom combat wounded veteran i know for a fact that trump holds so much more support for our boys and girls in uniform whether its in blue or green
biden you didnt create anything please go
whatever drug they have biden on starts to wear off at 1114 you welcome
ive heard it an it appears to me that trump was talking about himself what he was accusing president biden of doing a funny character trump is
abortion is a womens choice regardless of anyones thoughts
anytime you answer a question saying easy we will make them pay their fair share just know they are playing in our face
12205 is it just me as soon as i leave my house i see the failure of our country ask about anything nothing is going right at this point im i crazy
twice trump has been asked about his child care plans twice he has completely avoided the question and thrown back mud on biden answer the questions and let the dirt prove itself through the mouth of the one you are throwing it at
the brandon shoutout
world war iii is already here
just the expression s on biden s face is so creepy he s totally out of it joe hurt america beyond repair trump won the election and joe left billions of our millitary equipment in afghanistan brand new jeeps and aircraft and 13 of our own men killed and what does joe do he checks his watch and yawn s when the dead was brought back our precious soiders he is demonic
i understand donald they need to let me be his interpreter
all i see is that biden cares more about other countries than america we dont need that
americans shall be great again and again americans are the leaders of the world
joe just lying through his teeth the look he had on his face when trump talks is the look i have when joe speaks
free america from biden and this misery he cant even talk he is a puppet
if theres one thing to take away from this debate its relieft in the fact that we finally beat medicare
this guy looks and sounds so frail trump sounds so much sharper i didnt like trump before but there is a clear difference between the two its mind boggling were considering biden they should introduce a better candidate
605 preach
americans wake up you are being manipulated by the deep state read epic times and judicial watch for objective reality dont get fooled again
the only way to get votes have you have ro be to american citizen citizen and i believe these newcomers got it pretty quick takes a long time to be an an american showing proof and living here for a while and then you get status and look what happened american citizen how in the world did they get it so fast
age limits or cognitive test by law
haha lowered the price of prescription drugs as i cant afford medication that keeps me alive because a bottle is 600 dollars you can keep your lies mr biden
why did they both ignore child care
trump didnt say one true thing amazing
joe biden wed be able to elder care me internally yeah biden certainly needs more care
those cages have always been there in fact when obama was president is when they were noticed those cages go way back and they put the blame on trump which is a lie those cages sure were there but not during trumps time oh my gosh people mms oc or whatever her name is wherever shes from somewhere else she was blaming trump and it was their way before then get your facts right tell the truth
can we all finally wake up and realize that presidents dont actually run the country or make decisions impacting anything doesnt this debate featuring two completely in the clouds individuals wake anyone up the presidents dont matter lets find whos actually running the country and ask them questions and demand things from them presidents are put into place as a way to make us feel like we have input on those decisions we dont
america best country need the best pr√©sident in this moment for americans peoples and for country and for america world democracy
i dont think ive seen a more proficient liar than biden and all the things biden is promising he had over 3 years to accomplish trump kept most of his campaign promises during his term our economy our borders were good under trump i agree biden is the worst president in american history
looking at the usas history especially in ww2 and the cold war where it was the prominent economic powerhouse where it is now and especially its leadership is pathetic
actually if you did your homework ein employees identification number those of us who have worked most of our lives know how to work harder nowhere in my criminal background and criminal record says im a sex offender you accused wrong person for wrong reasons homework homework homework homework
surprised the comments are still open lol
its incredibly embarrassing to watch our current president
why was bien saluting to an non existing crowd when he walked in is he seeing ghosts
go trump we love you greets from holland
i missed the debate who won when is the next one
anyone see the movie idiocracy
why is robert f kennedy jr not there in the debate why is the choice of the american people curtailed by the cnn why is the debate between a senile old man and the sex offender being peojected as the only choice of the people of anerica
people better understand that security cost and the resorts is sending to the contention walls because do you want to wake up a live we must cooperate and sacrifice vacation for your kids future
every time biden says sentences my head
what an embarrassment the sitting president is
finally watched it despite the evangelical squad recruited to make noise online if one takes into account the content biden unsurprisingly was a league above yes his speech is blurred thats not the most important thing i am a non native speaker listened at x15 speed and had no problem understanding
the candidacy of donald trump looks stronger but still may not be the most suitable candidate for the position at stake
gooo trumpppp
complete knockout
for a house hold of 3 we pay 250300 a week 300 dollars worth of groceries barely gets you through the week
firths he was expose during 14 retire days so he got sick and even do he did resist the spiked he is the only one capable for the white house more over he may be and dangerous risk no only hen but the whole nation there are a lot of haters who like to live and controversial and love to create division between hen and the whole people
were so cooked
simpleamerican patriottrumprcmmunitcmprmiedchineeespydiaperje
wish i could log this in my letterboxd account
11000 his only point 11020 he fires bad people
im taking a shot every time biden says the idea im about to be zoinked out of my mind an hour in and im able to speak fjgfndjfhsb xndididldlsg
joe biden supporters are like christmas lights half of them dont work and the other half are not so bright
my god biden is such a liar trump24
amen trump about our veterans being abandoned by the biden administration
just so all know the border patrol never endorsed biden lol
the media tried so hard to censor this debate and force people to listen to biden ironically the censorship made the mainstream media look corrupt and listening to biden showed his incompetence good job
you realy giving numbers of killed isreals hostiges but just dont give any numbers about killed palestinians numbers dont mean if they show the wrong people right
america has only been respected by americans here we have two rich guys who are fooling the people left wing and right wing are part of the same bird ramericawa nothing lasts forever
choosing between 2 evils shouldnt be how an election goes america is a legit laughing stock
im not an americanim a filipino came to watch because i wanted to learned english more
thats jim carrey not joe
biden promises everything but only makes things worse wake up america
joes been milking that scranton line for the last 50 years that hes been a washington insider
this is peak cinema as a foreign
the idea
say what you will about biden at least he cares about stopping climate change trump pulled the us out of the paris accord because he deems it too expensive its to save the world man just pay for it
is this a joke bro putin is a serious politician compared to this
this debate is so cringey its hard watching that old demented guy stand there and pretend hes all there geez
when sleepy joe walks on and off the stage he wanders around like a roomba cleaning the floors
trump shartted on himself at 11625
im sorry to say i belong to a country and this is the best that we have to offer
so who is really running the country its not this guy i hope
didnt watch the video such a waste of time scrolling thru the comments however extremely worth it
biden just go rest too many wars broke down since you became a president we are tired and torn just go please
ive been waiting 4 years for this goodbye biden
i votedtrump the first time and im voting him again
love him or hate himtrump did every single thing he campaigned on in four years meanwhile biden is promising things again just to get elected wont do it
weve finally beat medicare
look at these comments if the votes and the states has biden reelected do we really trust our voting process scary and hopeless feeling if the fraud is not fixed and the nursing home patient wins
so you want to force billionaires to pay higher taxes thats not fair all people need to pay same type of tax on income
omg its terrible to watch biden just disturbing and mind made up trump 2024
way to go trump
why did the democrats allow a severely impacted alzheimers patient run why not open up to other candidates
nato shouldnt have built poland inland aegis facility in 2009 peactime economy crash and uk rolling red carpet out for russians to come invest here then ukraine found oil vicki nunland sent usa just needs to pull nato back stop poking the bear apologise on world news for sending vicki nunland over ther to interfere with govt russia leaked the calls but how many westerners heard them
dude biden soo sooo old it unbeleavable that you guys still let him run for president i mean whats you intention dont wake up after he was elected
biden had four years and he hasnt done any of these things hes talking about his ending statement
donald trump took credit for everything president biden has accomplished and threw his failures on biden everything trump said was literally a lie biden wins this by his truths alone no doubt donald trump is a pathological liar and its disgusting america trump insults americas intelligence and we cant continue to let him lie to us with a straight face biden definitely struggled but good god at least he was telling the truth
bidens expressions whenever trump talks is going down history as the greatest piece of comedy of all time especially with the amount of absurdist value it carries
not as heated as 2020
i voted for biden four years ago if he really cares about this country he would step down and not run so many americans dont like either candidate and many will not be voting if someone else would run for the democratic party they would have a much better chance of winning this presidential election
gladwellmokome7245 0 seconds ago such a proud moment to be a african these two are behaving like they are running for presidency in the banana republic not the mighty superpower putin is wating and he is like urrrra
biden learned a new way to start his sentences the idea that
no need of debate sir trump rocks
why do democrats think its the richs responsibility to pay for the national debt why are we responsible for government overspending
wow biden has obviously received the questions weeks ago and has been practising the answers ever since he talks without any conviction just like someone who has to learn word for word without understanding anything total clown show anyway after watching for 10 mins i am done
im spanish right and i hear that why do you think black families are suffering for this or that and im here thinking why they separate black problems from white problems like from my understanding here most black people in america act and dress like in a rap music video and from my understanding black on black crimes are really high and theres lot of black people in prison in america so my humble opinion is there but again why they separate in colors like whats the point ps here in spain theres lots of illegal inmigration and i would like a president like trump or poland tbh its getting out of hand
just watched jb is a liar
this looks more like an snl sketch or southpark episode than a real debate
belgium herewhat is going on heresorry but bidenyour hope is clearly ready for a retirement homeplease please get someone elseor else trump is going to win and you know itbiden isnt fit to work any job anymorenot even mcdonalds
this debate image alone gives me game show vibes game is game
the only question joe had an answer to right away was social security his reply was communism
omg i want my papa biden to winbut now im undecidedgod bless america
biden keeps talking about the current country failures its like he literally doesnt realize he is the president
didnt watch this when it aired so trying to see what happened to bidan its all over the news
usa are in danger both of them are same
notice 11308 biden tells you to look up the information yet he on the list also
why are they not answering the questions they get childcare not answered drug abuse not answered they especially trump stalk about whatever they want and not sticking to the topic
biden says hes going to fix the taxes dude youve been in government for like 57 years
2804 is the debate edited it looks as if something was cut
this is a joke debatetheyre both not on topic at all and both not answering any of the questions
thats not therealdebate
personally i wouldnt vote for either bc we have examples like the el salvador president which id rather have over these two but donald is our best bet at this point sleepy joe is a joke
i like and love mr trump personally but i dont want to see him in the next term mr biden is sick and ill but he is better for the american people and the whole world
people said president biden did not hold trump accountable for the lies in this debate he held him accountable for quite a few lies at quite a few points i dont see and understand why people have said that
joes explanation of the trimesters of a pregnancy is a little off
1616 did he just immigration abortion
what about the spy balloon and ccp shell companies
its not crazy to anybody how a president calls out any citizen maga or not an american citizen should never be talked about im especially a big group
i feel sorry for the americans how can these be their candidates
biden the idea that
lil biden would have more success as a mumble rapper
dont feel bad for trump dont feel bad for biden i feel bad that we black folks will never have same opportunity as everyone elses both president and both host used the statement us black american and job guess we need us black america president because we black folk understand the unspoken word from all three parties
old lier vs old dementia how absurd
name the 13 marines that passed away joe dont look at your watch
this is so sad how can this be so bad trump affirms so many lies he reminds me of bad times in history scary
yk i ship trump and biden their ship name is trubiden
joe was showing a how dare you face
biden was dead from the start
the fact that biden is running is a crime
the idea every time he starts talking the idea
i feel bad for biden hes too old for this
i agree with trump let the businesses pay very little taxes it helps them pay our salaries government needs to be knocked down a peg or two trump was the greatest president this country has ever had
were doomed theyre not even answering questions just goin back and forth like little kids
you left it open hahaha 81 million votes ladies and gents
wow just within the first 3 biden answers how can anyone defend this guy his wife should be ashamed of herself to let this happen to her husband im shocked
why is trump running for president he was impeached was he not
scary
bro went from jobs to his kitchen table to prices to literal drugs in 2 minutes biden
100 then 120 now is this a joke more like double now 200 cnn lies constantly
biden is the master mind why theres war in ukraine and russia war in israel and pakistan and conflicts with philippines and china
the irony is after this debate it is 100 obvious that biden is not running this country how could he if that is the fact we want unfettered access to the oval office we want to see him daily in action not handled but day in day out dealings clearly there will be private meetings but there will be way more nonprivate meetings events discussions etc show us voters biden in presidential mode on a daily basis not cherry picked events or footage not question and answer periods where he is fed info in his ear or someone pulls him away you have 4 months until we vote four months to prove he is really running the country 4 months to put him out there to answer all questions and not prescreened questions
biden is ang ai robotic
poor guy he needs to stand down and rest
trump never mentioned all the deaths of fentanyl under biden he never mentioned biden ending support of all our police forces and police deaths trump didnt even have to mention all the rioting and stores being broken into and stolen from and closing trump never mentioned biden letting illegals destroy texas homeowners property they had to take the law in their own hands biden did nothing about it trump didnt mention the schools butchering and confusing young children and exposing them to harmful books trump didnt mention the money biden cost the us for taking down a border fence that was almost completely built kamela never made it to the border she didnt even know she was speaking in south korea what a joke i do think they should stop hiding behind joe and let the poor guy go home and rest with his ice cream maybe he can have an ice cream party with nancy pelosi i think trump was kind to joe
1200 literally dying sounds
its amazing how bad joe speaks yet people still root for him showing the world how dumb weve become everything he says is remembered and not from his own mind just a puppet lol
american friends i feel for you i shall pray for you all
biden is just a puppet being told what to say and then forgetting what to saytrump will not only help the us but also alot of other problems in the world
every single word uttered by biden was a lie
biden needs to go sit at home and enjoy his life he doesnt need to be a president
the whole government as a whole is a faction of evil i will never subscribe to a label
im french and i wish your next pr√©sident will be mr trump
even a 12 year old kid would say that biden is too old cannot speak clearly and should retire i hope amerian citizens are smart
make america great again trump 2024
if this doesnt wake people up to how incompetent biden is i dont know what will
the first and the last debate
i think it was the first time i heard biden even acknowledge the election fraud throughout all of it he acted like he just didnt need to say anything but anyone whose not an idiot knows they stole the 2020 election if he had any class at all or actual concern for uniting the country then he would have taken an active stance in investigating and disproving it but he knew he couldnt he has always been and always will be a fraud
top 3 biden phrases thats simply not true the fact of the matter is the idea that
two goofballs in a pool
stopped at when hamas envaded israel they hate each others gut but still agree on supporting genocide nothing will change then
why are there only 2 candidates im not american
its crazy how biden thinks he did something good for us i cant name one thing he did in this country that was good
the idea that vs let me get back to one thing
bro none of these guys are fit to be president both of them contributed to where we are now both printed money and now feeling the effects
i think biden has an earpiece someone telling him what to say you can see him concentrating on the voice
biden got demolished it was beautiful
its since came to light that there where up to 250 fbi agents in the crowd that went into the building on jan 6thlet that sink in why where there that many agents there
abt the boarder biden lying
dumb and dumber i feel sorry for my neighbors to the south
honestly biden should never have continue running for president his inability to produce a cohesive sentence is whacked
trump made a really good point at 1520 you have to get elected to get anything done the implication which he hints at is that means you may have to say things you dont really believe just to get elected
when they started taking offense to the golf comments
12142 the idea that somehow we are this failing country i never heard a president talk like this before dude literally said the same thing about our country under trumps presidency look at all the hypocrisy and lies
as a black man i will never vote for biden he did more for ukraine than americans
im with trump
we are so tired of those old unstable pals give us someone sane and younger
thumbs up for trump
america what is wrong with you is this really 2 best men guys your screwed
when biden says he doesnt have to he lies again and again joe biden i dont feel and i dont think youre helping and standing by us bye joe
nithing concern me on the debate november coming close 17 millions views better cash out
its the fact that not one of them actually answered a question that does it for me
biden the sky is blue and its impossible for a ant to stand on a elephant while the cat is at the barbershop
absurd reality we live in a clown and a zombie i am not siding with the zombie but yall are absoletely crazy to think trump would ever care about anyone other than himself trump first not america give him full control and he will do as he did with his companies get as much money out of it for personal gains as possible before filing for bankrupcy investors see no money coming back because it didnt work out but what did work out is his wealth in reality increasing as opposed to his wealth on paper if you go by the papers the only thing he has in terms of money is his taxdebts
its sad that biden did such a terrible job because you know they gave him not trump the questions ahead of time
lets really be honest it doesnt matter whos in office just take a moment and think all the president s preseeds the world has continued to get so much better joke 4 the people in the bleachers the country has been led astray
if trump is ready to leave ukraine and occupied territories to russia now tomorrow trump will leave alaska state to russia within one day
11223 the most admired country in the world
i like how the debate rules changed to protect biden and he still got destroyed
biden speaking gibberish trump i really dont know what he said and i dont think he knows what he said either
as a minority i made the most money i ever had under trumps leadership made more dollar went further
the us is a massive joke
make american great again
my grandma is 94 and has much better speech than biden
the lord is cold man
weird i need the caption turned on when biden is talking
biden will create your warstrump will stop it and clean the swamp
theres no one coming from insane asylums only trump lies like this and uses such bigoted language
there are no abortions ripping babies out of the woman ever there are sometimes c sections to save the baby there are also terrible circumstances where women must birth a dead infant or stillborn birth trump knows nothing
trump massive landslide incoming
in new york city its illegal to get an abortion after 6 weeks
biden is too old trump doesnt deserve to be running after he incited a riot after losing the last election this is the democrats and republicans way of spitting at the voters showing you your vote doesnt matter by giving you two of the worst possible candidates to choose from lol this election everyone should vote for anyone that isnt a d or r
is that a biden clone
poor biden looks like a smacked baby every time trump brings up his major failures he doesnt perk up again until trump tells a lie if trunp was capable of sticking to the truth biden would be in tears
trump is 78 let that sink in
age doesnt matter for a wise man like joe to be a president we have an old stupid worst president here in zimbabwe
im voting for trump because another 4 years of biden i feel i will loose my socsecurity and medical insurance
its weird to hear biden take credit for insulin prices i remember when trump signed that bill
im british and i suooort trumpi did the last time but he got corrupted by bidens gangsters he is corrupt to the core
biden is making fun at a world more on those who vote for him
oof those deficit numbers are just straight up lies biden has over 116 trillion dollars of deficit increase including 48 trillion in enacted legislation 48 trillion in higher interest costs and 2 trillion in executive actions source house budget committees website
sleepy joe just wants to sleep so leave him alone
go with trump bro dont be with biden he is gonna kill us hes been rising prices that public pools are closing now and everything is all cause of him lets say thank god the comments are open
none of them know how to answer questions
biden is winning this next election by more votes than he did the last election
whos really been running the country
biden is suffering from asthma his breathing is bad
the idea
we are praying for trump success in jesus name amen
is it really true according to trump that america is no longer respected in the world under biden
i hate that people now gaslight about not knowing biden was fried the whole time
what is really happening here
trump is the best choice for amerigo and the world
im scared about what trump thinks hes going to do about russia is he going to let them keep crimea and the other annexed parts of ukraine
octogenarians contesting in america is a big show in historygoodluck
trump should go to jailall hes ever done is lie
id love to see vavek on the stage with biden he might actually ans some questions
why people are soo poised against trump and support someone who is clearly a former hero and man of state but a lovely elder in need of care instead of being used and abused as a puppet sad
please cease and desist from associating and besmirching the good name and morals of our members with this clusterfksigned the alley cat association of america
i feel bad for americans for having such a special ed president
i lose brain cells every time i hear biden speak
as someone who voted for biden in the first election i gotta say my stance on him has changed the long and short of it is he is too old i mean jesus christ and fries there was no one else seriously i cannot support having an almost 82 year old man for another 4 years in office no offense to our seniors out there but no thank you on biden he had a good political career id give him that but its time to just enjoy retirement changedtotrump
this comment section gets my vote for funniest act ever
i keep having to rewind this to try to make sense of biden
this comie fuuu is aliar
i wanted to hear them talk about childcare prices
go trump america needs you
can we vote not to have biden or trump good god they both suck so bad
the worlds interest in the debate is to hear about their future plans and not blaming each other
no 1 i think its a no2 oh no its in my pantsjill where is jill
the comment section is more entertaining and meaningful than the actual debate we are listening to
214 he almost got lost
the fact that theyre calling poor colleges black colleges and rich colleges white colleges is inherently racist there is no segregation of races in colleges say low income this is elementary
where is redemption look up the word in dictionary
biden blaming trump for the economy during his time as president when we held our ground outstandingly during covid is a joke
trump won he can speak
mr president trump we need you again
biden spends so much time speaking for trump and avoiding questions that would require him to speak for himself its honestly pathetic
more like double the price for groceries used to be 100 for a couple bags now 200 for the same groceries crazy how biden cooking americans
go mr trump fix america like it was before biden destroyed it totally
i feel sad for biden hes always been crooked and not politically impressive what bothers me is hes sick not his fault but the malicious people around him only want and power regardless of how much they despise and have tried to destroy the average american and america biden is obviously in a severe cognitive decline that deserves our sympathy my beloved immigrant mother died at the relatively young age of 75 due to advanced alzheimers so this issue hits me very close
jan 6 attack on white house who is guilty im not an atty
they endorse me for president i wont say that but they endorse me for president
trump trump trump wwww
biden you need to see a geriatrician and go to a home
i cant believe the americans voted biden in power
can everyone please listen to what theyre actually saying we make wise decisions when were listening to both people and forming our own rational conclusions biden might be stuttering and old but some of the things he is saying mostly at the beginning do sound more concrete than what trump was saying trump sounds more audible but the things hes saying are more harmful
trump for presiden to have a better country greater safer and richer people prepared to work for usa
fjb trump 2024
in our time to access information how come we cant find some younger and coherent people to represent our country instead we have 2 old farts tolkig about how great they are when rest of us scratch our heads and wallets with disbelieves dont know if we should cry or laugh
this is just embarrassing to watchand these are the choices we have to choose from
i stand by all alley cats
president biden with all due respect please stop embarrassing yourself and your party
u guys love war
between trumpbiden and putin i say obey the pandemic laws the appointed chief is chief mr vlad for ukrain give biden fines for trespassing he is not assigned anything unjust did bully with vaccines release steve bannor from jail
instead of slamming each other answer the important questions theyre both little babies
trump confidently stated whole lies half truths and fabrication gaslighting about supremacy and not answering a single question biden mumbled was very offended at the idea and defended genocide neither are fit
3025 the whole world is blowing under him
annd err btwaycld we or usa rule out maxx age for presidency is eg 68so tht people cld see real calibre not only old folksopen to blunders
they both should have to take a competence test
is exactly the same in spain frontiers open all benefits for ilegal immigrants who are the ones responsible for squatter private property and police cant do anything about it and judiciary path can take so long but by law the owner can not stop paying for them not to have water supply or electricity an 87 years old man is in prison for confronting an ilegal jumping 2 am in the morning with an electric saw took frightened his firegun to frighten him but unfortunately he died on the spot the old man then call the police and told them what happened this grandpa is called pepe lomas he was taken into court and sentenced to prison do you want this for usa
biden got empty brain to generate words against trump
goodness biden or trump what a choice
almost forgot to see it again today
tq cnn for inviteerrr is this real or aiversiontq
i hate living here
well democrats hope you are waking up and realizing the media has been lying to you for years about biden and they lie about everything else too and start accepting trump as the 47th president as it will be a trump landslide
dont forget that he has the power to start a nuclear war
he is old but u sir also very old
with the best of everything how did nothing get done
every time biden says if im elected ill do x why have you not done it already why are you waiting till 2nd term
vetrens need help biden put insurance on their headsask trump first
trump at least went to north korea
immigration remove babies from their mothers omg wasnt there a senator who had to get help n be authorized to check on children locked up in cages children were illegally being adopted n older children too scattered across america americans forget where they came from america is indian land
i respect trump he is a builder __ not for me dint trust him
what is black jobs
why is biden so head strong on woman and their god given right to decide for themselves not a doctortheres too much lgbtq doctors
when joes skin shoots back and his ears shoot back and he gets that by ply fore head we are talking a big lie
gang exploitation has been an issue lomg before biden
this is scary and stand up comedy at the same time
what about operation warp speed
not a word about high credit card interest rates
go back and look at biden early in his political career completely racist lol
the whole idea is to see that biden cant hold the position so the next step will be to replace him with our agreement with kamala or even worst hillary this is the plan remember what i said
jo got into hunters stach
the more fascistic a country becomes the more radical we are forced to become in response
so they conflicted about literally everything but they agreed to exterminate the islamic world
and the beards have growm longer over night
biden must think were all fools or have very limited memories he speaks lies without any boundaries i hope people can see through him
those socialist have the same lecture prepared and read i am from spain and i can see it
like if you want wsj to post the sequel in september
biden is ready to jump over to attack our trump
conservatives be like you guys are just now starting to realize this dude is brain dead
why is so frightening that trump win the elections
this debate hosted by the two zionists should have taken place at an old folks home
project 2025 is pure gop fascism
315 the moment when trump was certain that he would win the presidential elections
america is now proving that they are a joke im proudly african
poor americans are battling between the demented one and a brainiac and our elections was a big jokethe funniest outcomes of largest democracies
i think we all know my rfk wasnt allowed in these people are all corrupt
this is unacceptable only two options neither candidate came out and said i want to be president of the united states of america i am so very disappointed with the closing speeches neither said i want to be president because trump did say and explain why he wants to be president again during the debate i just wish he wouldve made that his closing speech both candidates make the position seem a burden only worth fighting for bragging rights
in my opinion biden has to be replaced as candidate of the democratic party with obama
cnn has their comments locked im excited to go through these
they forgot to ask biden what is your favourite flavour of ice cream
biden is way too old its catching him now not good to lead us in his condition is he a puppet now its sad i feel bad for him but strait out he has to go now but no good in place of him need better to win this election im praying too
great britain has finest military pro qo
ol hoss moving his ear piece
american people vote for trump he will make your country very strong
i wonder how did biden become president of the most prestige nation
wildly entertaining seeing bidens expressions and listening to him try to speak normally
all round oh deary me
the whole golf challenge is hilarious
i love this new comedy show
trump is bullying biden an im all 4 it lol
we definitely in a depression right now
bro i understand young thug clearly compared to biden no problem
this is too much i jave no comments holy god
biden is bitterly unfit for the office
bro grocery went from a 100 to now 300 its literally insaine
i think biden had some kind of stroke and they are keeping it quiet
i can hear him but his mic is low
trumpwhats your name bidenname
even with extremely biased cnn moderators trump still wins
wow i feel sad for the guy but come on world poor joe is getting old so someone else is running things trump should take over world
puppet show talking bs especially that idiot on the right side and host are so one sided take out that ear peace from their ears and then youll see real comprehension of both apponenets the only choice of two ids is trump
i see the humor in this but its terrifying that these are the options on who should lead the usa
is biden laundering money though hostagesthats what a friend asked me
silence is be thinking
climate change isnt suvs its not settled science its a scam
its joever
12222 interviewer trump do you have anything to say about peoples concerns towards your ability to be president trump i have a high iq and i am really good at golf biden i bet i can beat you in golf
wsj airing cnn copyrights
about halfway through the moderators started calling joe president byebye
im from india i support donald trump 100 facts
trump is catastrophe
i think data say it all but in this debate trumps win but biden wins in performance thats all i can say
biden ideas caused everything expensive
this orchestrated biden acts old drops out newsom becomes president elections get canceled newsom serves 8 years newsom and pelosi sell america to china and russia ww3 breaks out martial law and one world government control 99 peasant population the 1 work along with ai to keep humans enslaved last attempt for revolution takes place in the future when the peasants go to war with sticks and stones unfortunately ai wins and the surviving peasants are left to live underground and in tunnels this is terminator ai takeover and theres nothing the people can do now change future its all been predestined

what do you think is the most embarrassing moment
dam trump is sharp answer most questions and get back at all bidens mumbling
we seriously couldnt find anyone else come on dems get it together
i side with trump yes trump we felt the tax cut across the board us white black yellow and brown etc no credit to you joe biden the illegitimate president
drake and kendrick walked so trump and biden could run
im from india and im stand with donald trump opinion and its great to see such kind of debate between ex president and current president our prime minister modi during his entire tenure in the last 10 years not attended a single debate on our country issues with any leader of opposition and its shame on our prime minister as a indian citizen we also want a debate between narendra modi and rahul gandhi who wants a debate between pm and rahul gandhi just like it and its shame on you joe bidden you are reason of war between ukraine and russia hammas and israel because of it thousands of innocent child old people young people and women lost their lives its shame on you joe bidden you are criminal for the innocent of palestine ukraine russia israeil and united states as well
trump was never charged with a sex crime he was charged with defamation of charachter for saying shes not my type total bs
when u think u know english come back to this vid to prove u wrong at this point i need a translator for what biden is saying
all this man does his lie i dont hear one word of truth out of his mouth joe biden is a known liar the economy is so great why is there 28 m t businesses in my town alone
im perplexed as to why biden is being blamed for inflation when the entire world is suffering from this same inflation crisis since the pandemic
they made trump the underdog again get ready hahahaha
the idea the idealook heres the thing er you knowthe thing bye done
how to have robots on this
i i like trump but he is holding masters degree in lying
trump did tell people to go home twitter removed his message and banned himyoure all snakes
biden made some noticeable slip ups but for the most part he didnt debate that badly at all i dont know if im biased towards him with the little i know albeit neither of them are the most appealing candidates by any means necessary and they both lie trump frequently more than biden but this election is going to be close and neither candidate is a favorite at all i feel like politics is sickening but this comes from someone who is not all informed i mean what it comes down to is this for us we have a choice between a creepy comprimised coot and a conniving criminal
bidens staring off into another dimension always gets me
360 million people and the choice boils down to this
my wife is on exmental life support mayday mayday

trump is a killer biden beat medicare
donors for biden was probably wondering where did i go wrong
biden is fossalizing right before our eyes
thank you president trump for veterans choice joe biden did nothing for ushes riding your coattails
its all just a big game anyways its crazy watching two adults arguing like children
i bet the us cannot wait for trump to get back in
trump is the next president
really ads during the presidential debate
11906 3 times no answer
trump destroyed biden with basic facts too easy
biden is a war criminal not putin
the more i watch trump speaking the more my hand starts to develop his own personality
watching this im not even listening to the debate im really worried about president bidens health
biden says reasonable things
trump billions n billions of obamagate billions n billions of laptops billions n billions of open borders biden heres the deal heres the deal heres the deal did you understand me neither
biden need to go home and retire
what about robert kennedy jr
i want neither of these dinosaurs god help us sincerely an atheist
the whisper king back at it again
is there a young man out there 310
if i was an american and old enough then i would vote for donald trump
830 surprised biden face
hour and thirty minutes its too long
so just like i suspected the moderators are totally slanted they dont let trump answer any of bidens charges this is ridiculous
biden cant help but plagiarize and lie
how many times is the sleepy guy gonna saythe idea
to anyone dealing with depression or feeling low dont give up on life no matter what bad things happened in your past dont let them define you or control your destiny you are all important and loved there is hope for all of us jesus loves you all get to know god through christ
i would love to see a debate with fact checkers and statics to see the faces after every claim
i really feel if pablo escobar runs for office he would beat both of these idiots
donald trump
i just cant understand how trump have such a huge following in the united states how can someone trust this guy the biggest trickster alive its amazing
very small percentage of women being graped not a thing its blue pill betas that keep repeating this narrative
i had way more money when trump was president now im broke
how cringe
both men should have retired long ago
cnn gave biden the questions and he sure is playing with his earpiece i mean ear a lot
the last one to go home please turn off the lights
just an outside perspective since im not american points made by trump were towards the questions points made by biden were towards what trump did wrong then trump was then obligated to correct biden it was a vicious cycle
how many number ones and numbers twos did this man spit in this debate lawl
bidens already dead but someone has forgot to bury somehow rip anyway
im a filipino and im very thankful jbiden for helping the philippines a hundred percent to depend against china but we saw until now china is always bullying the filipino a military and the civilians iis this the right for jbiden to help filipinos
bidens eyes are scarey maybe thats why he sniffs childrens hair instead of looking at them his eyes would scare them he looks like a zombie
biden seems completely normal to me just slower and dumber than usual
ahahahaha americans have biden as a president
we found our selves in a situation where
how embarrassing for this country these 2 are our only choices biden looks confused half dead and trump is a grown child who looks like every tycoon movie villain
biden is the us president
1 bad debate isnt worse than the over 30 lies told by trump
people want biden at first because what he promise people but now that they see what he can and cant do we sure need to change him
012109 what is biden on about now trump sent hightech manufacturing jobs over to china from usa is he talking about what happend multiple decades ago in tech manufacturing industry in general but blaims trump for it or about trumps last term in office i think its widely known that trump was always against moving manufacturing abroad this has been pretty well documented besides im pretty sure trump did the exact opposite during his last term in office he initiated changes and tax breaks to move tech manufacturing jobs back to the us seems biden is outright lying about things saying trump has done x when he did the opposite and gets no recognition from our beloved media but plenty of fools in comment section cryin about how trump lies without given examples and never owning up to any outright lie from their own side yet people like to play psuedo intellectual and say both sides are just as bad without even knowing much bout anything naah thats cool just keep hating trump even though you barely know why do your hate thing
trump is your brain biden is your brain on drugs
wanted to tell everyone that jesus loves you all and that jesus christ is king those who wanna accept jesus as lord and saviour here is the prayer of salvation according to romans 10 v 9 o lord god l believe with all my heart in jesus christ son of the living god i believe he died for me and god raised him from the dead i believe hes alive today i confess with my mouth that jesus christ is the lord of my life from this day through him and in his name l have eternal life lam born again thank you lord for saving my soul iam now a child of godhallelujah holy spirit come into heart amen congratulations beloved john 14 v 6 jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me hallelujah
i cant even understand what he says he just mumbles off and i stop paying attention
i see a pattern with trump he doesnt care whos in the firing line to get to his next presidential term he a narcissist a truly horrible person and is going to get us all killed i hope if joe does get his next term then hes going to need a very strong team to work very closely with him and be on point
wanted to tell everyone that jesus loves you all and that jesus christ is king those who wanna accept jesus as lord and saviour here is the prayer of salvation according to romans 10 v 9 o lord god l believe with all my heart in jesus christ son of the living god i believe he died for me and god raised him from the dead i believe hes alive today i confess with my mouth that jesus christ is the lord of my life from this day through him and in his name l have eternal life lam born again thank you lord for saving my soul iam now a child of godhallelujah holy spirit come into heart amen congratulations beloved john 14 v 6 jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me hallelujah

we finally beat medicare yayyyyy
watching this now before it is getting deleted bye biden the nursing home is shouting your name it is time
this is idiocracy in real life
ukraine average age of soldiers is 45 smfh our proxy war wiped out a generation all war over energy hunter biden on ukraines energy board how did blowing up the nordstream pipe line help the climate largest release of methane gas ever black rock controls our government
you know each of them embellish everything stated biden really looks taken back like its his first time dealing with face to face competition though in disbelief that he has to find ways to counters how untrue a statement may actually be yall in murica are a riot best tv series to date replaced jersey shore for me years ago
listen i understand if u indetify as a trump voter i respect u but be better
biden is good for us and for everybody not trump
this looks like an snl skit to me thanks for keeping the comment section open btw cnn has closed it down the only media who uphold american values the saviour from trumps fascism have turned off their comment section freedom of speech and all of that is rolling in their graves
biden the ideabla bla bla the idea bla bla bla thr idea
trump bunch of lies
the next erb is gonna be amazing
i dont usually commend cnn bc they are phake nooz but whoever made the decision to split screen did the right thing but they still want us to not trust our lyin eyes
i think biden could still win the debate with that hoarse if he was more aggresive and styled after clint eastwood from gran torino
what about other contestants
this was hard to watch
as a current military member nobody has done more to hurt us than biden since he came into office and slashed our budget and changed laws regarding how we got our financing and gummed up the budget approval in the senate over and over again ive had more training exercises cancelled than i can count due to lack of funding we had our pay delayed months at a time imaging not paying your military members on time how could you do that and say your helping anyone let alone veterans trump cares for our troops and has proven it through his actions biden hates our military and using his dead son as an excuse to try and look better is shameful this debate really shows how inept biden is and i think we are all wondering whos really pulling he strings behind the mask
every word out of bidens mouth is a lie hes lied so much throughout his life he doesnt even know hes lying at this point nobody is fooled by him he needs to ride off into his twilight years into a nice cushy nursing home paid for by the millions of dollars hes acquired illegally during his career its embarrassing that our great country has him at the helm god help us all vote trump 2024
i wouldnt be here if he was a great president that was the clincher trump 2024 you got this mr president
it is literally an old man vs an ultra large capitalist bro none of them are suitable enough
even the cnn guy still calls him president trump nobody f with biden bro
this is the best that america has to offer yahuah in control help us
did biden not get an adrenaline shot during the break
thank you democrats unfortunately all can see just debate are you camping now
i think trump is the next president of america
i actually feel bad for biden doesnt the president need to make fast clear decisions
okwhos actually running this country please dont say biden
biden is very detailed and should get some credit
were cooked guys god bless merica
and by the way 10531
i can out of watching this a lot worse after watching biden i dont want to live that long if i turn into someone like him
what a disgrace all of bidens answers were rehearsed these are terms he memorized the idea listen to how many times he says the idea and number 1 and number 2 and number 3 he has no idea what he is doing and im shocked he was able memorize anything he will be 86 in his last term i cant imagine him being able to stand and eat on his own in 6 months he was weak 4 years ago the level of decline with the best healthcare and doctors can money can buy at his disposal shows just how bad his current dementia is trump is mentally stronger but just as dangerous if not more so god help us all end of times are upon us
wheres kennedy
trump said the whole world is blowing up under biden
trump is telling us something here and hes playing minds games with biden 1401
this two elite are the best us can offer
tax reduction is all this zombie has
i am a veteran and to hear what creepy joe said what he did for us vets i erupted bogus i was yelling obscenities at the screen in honor of every single veteran i know
no one trusts the us after decades of acting like children on the workd stage never keeping their word letting friends stand in the rain after the action no one truts the us any more the exceptionalist attitude doesnt help
the american president people what a disgrace the greatest enemies of americans are those master minds that want to keep president biden in the office so that they continue controlling us they way they want
we should not vote for either of these elitists
an international magazine said a russian government jet flew to new york and washington on the 26th on friday it was parked by trumps plane in virginia where he was giving his campaign speech why isnt anyone talking about that too
everyone keep in mind that joe biden didnt get elected he was appointed by tyrants in the united states democratic party and the chinese communist this is the most ridiculous debate in the history of this country
you people need to fight to keep our democracy no one is safe in a dictatorship ask the canadian couple that moved to russia in favor of their christian beliefs their bank accounts were frozen vote to save democracy
anyway we have hawk thua
but how did americans vote jbd is america still a super power country
why are they asking him of jan 6 isnt he forbidden on speaking on the subject now are they trying to trap him
what in the recidivist is going on with the republican using extreme recidivism
why biden always looks suprised when he looks at trump
a train wreck for biden fjb
there was no lies in anything trump said the funny thing is thats the medias go to line but you have to notice this they never specify what lies trump told
im not wealthy by a long shot and i got those tax breaks as well my paycheck went further under trump
im still trying to figure out what lies have trump told
what are black jobs and hispanic jobs someone kindly explain to me because im not american and i dont understand are jobs in america sorted by race
border patrol publicly addressed and called out biden saying they never endorsed him
is there no other younger good administrators in america other than biden and trump just asking
1153 covid i skibidi with bruh we are cooked
we are screwed six ways to sunday i dont want either one of them as a president return both to seller please one is falsely advertised and the other is malfunctioning before our eyes all you can do is laugh and cry simultaneously
he beat it to death
it is embarassing for america that either one of these two men is running for presidential elections as an european i can only cringe
the idea
its true that within the past year the us has gone to crazy plus the world but aside from the anti america protesters why is la a third world country and new york a prison where no one is held to follow law
beacuse fake moon landing disease in comedy tv show
the idea that biden
come on rogan set it up
i am worried about that when bidden fall down
my vote is for trump
poor joe trump is a real bully i mean from a charisma perspective obviously trump comes off as the more fit individual but i dont think i can count on two hands how often he brought up the millions of millions of immigrants that supposedly live in fivestar hotels in ny and similar fear mongering sure the situation at the border is bad sure there are some bad people coming in but hes blowing it hella out of proportion meanwhile joe makes more points akin to normal politics but he sounds like he hasnt had a glass of water in 14 days im not american so thankfully im spared of having to choose between two geriatric dudes my heart goes all out to all americans who have to live with this dire situation
trump is a liar
we in asia are so happy to see standup comedy show in the white house
trump has excellent foreign relations diplomacy his domestic policies dont suit everyone
i kinda feel bad for biden like look at him he already knows he most likely lost he just wants to get this over with
biden was bussing in ilegall imigrents into philadelphia to lazurn st putting them on a housing and monthly paid program 8 busses a day for 3 months 2 years ago it is a fact i saw with my own eyes
trump is a business man and he would know how to run the country like his business see how successful trump is
we created 15000 jobs but arent there billions of people in the world
biden needs rest hes look older than a great grandfather
what a joke biden is he will never get my vote its a shame he is still in office he has no knowledge and a waste to this country
poor man he needs to step down or released from being its president
praying trump will be the president for another 15 to 20 years
biden sounds like a nursing home resident this is sad
biden looks like hes one of the thunder birds the way he moves and talks so go thunder bird biden walking go thunder bird biden talking hes a good puppet
if lies are contiually repeated and accepted over and over and no one is accountable then we will probably have a free for all because our protecting service men are elsewhere and unaware that the united states and our rights are under attack
biden is nearly demented democrats need a new candidate if they intend to win
both of them dont deserve to be the president of usa
biden sounds like hes been walking in the saharan desert for a week
i cant understand what biden is saying and hes speaking english that sounds like he hasnt drank a cup of water in months
cnn doing the presidential debate is rather biased considering their stance on trump over the years
the democratic party has so many great potential presidential candidates i get it a lot of them are not old white guys but shiet who cares as long as culturally they are american have honor and strength combined with empathy and an ability to join all people together then give them a shot to be the leader
biden please support the poor people with all the money u spend on war and weapons
i think u guys test those weapons on the innocent
no wonder almost noone watched this biden made little too no sense looking like a corpse while trump dodges questions and proclaim to be the best in everything always while both spend 90 of the debate saying how there the best president in history while the other one being the worst in history bearly memable its just boring at this point lies and no progress on anything
biden is clearly gone mentally physically i think he will probably be close to death within few yearsto let him even stand is elder abuse he has very little idea what he is saying and struggles to say it a few pre rehearsed answers mumbled out its just too clear now that he isnt fit for duty a massive mistake for the dems to let him take part in this debate
america has to awaknowlage that the laws that were created where for american crimes and criminals to making sure that we were a just and compationate country but we have been attacked and bombarded with so much abuse and criminalities and incensitive indifference in our own homeland that we didnt see that these are real terrorism by the real terrorists that have silently and strtigicly are as a cancer eating up and devouring us along with our last hopes of democracy and life as we know it i am able and explain things better using our anatomy thank you
biden needs an english teacher
john fury
bro did they cut out bidens closing speech
does biden actually believe what he is saying about the border unreal
if biden gets elected then we will all be going to war into ukaraine and for what because of a guy with dementia is delusional that russia is on a mssion to take over the world complete bollox
we love trump
bro bidens only face emotions are
the american people are brainwashed by the news media americans are like sheep cant think for themselves the media fuels the hate on each side in my opinion and most of the rest of the world opinion neither is a good candidate to be president onje has reached an age where they cant think straight and the other might be a little corrupt 335 million us citizens is this really the best you have reallly
everybody talking down on biden but im asking god to cover him in these times hes seen more than we have seen all while trying to carry all of us on his back for many more years than we realize bidenharris
i noticed trump doing small nods or shakes of the head when biden said things inside i knew he was like haha this bozo is flunking this debate but kept his cool unlike 4 years ago smart move agreeing to the rules on trumps part
bidenomics destroyed my marriage and i swear she changed after taking the jab of which i did not partake
why they wearing gang colors on their ties
nah bro cuz when trump was president it was peaceful bro there were no wars
the way biden stare trump its like some1 had been taugth by a scientist
the american people will get the president they deserve
the american people will get the president they deserve
this debate was one of the lowest point in the usa political history
i love what trump said about if he rigged the system itd be a lot more nasty than it is hes right look at what he knows and how he knows
11500 trump was giving real advice there
trump is totally unhinged and literally cannot tell the truth about anything but biden is losing it and we are worse off by literally every metric since biden took office including inflation unemployment including black etc healthcare costs drug ods crime rate international instability us hate crimes uneven wealth distribution to the 1 homelessness housing costs etc etc its going to be a hard decision both presidents are inept and dangerous for different reasons but the trump handlers seem to do a better job than the biden handlers
i agree texas has wayyyyyy too many immigrants not enough jobs or resources especially in the hood go talk to your local gas station owner youll find out trump isnt lien
hilarious how they interrupt this with an ad from obama begging for money for joe who would give biden a dime after watching this disaster trump 2024
i gave up on this when cnn started playing the race card againprofesional victims
biden oh and by the way
trump didnt reply to any question hahahahaha
a country of 333 million people and highest number of nobel laureates in the world and these two are the best they could find to govern
biden is like a zombie i think he doesnt even know where he is
biden did not help us black folks trump got my black vote
inside jobs deleting files is criminal behavior and activities
its funny trump making fun of biden when they around the same age they are both too old to be running for office its just that one is a real dumpster fire more than the other biden doesnt wanna leave power because of all the money he gets from donors he throws americans a few policies but trump is just chaos all through
i donot like mr trumps policy but mr biden is quite old and weak any candidate
im laughing hard on biden respone
biden may be old and have his faults but trump is not the answer our economy has nothing to do with biden when trump left office this country was at rock bottom and its not going to get better over night
start counting the lies biden told he said his son was killed in iraq his son died of a brain tumor
cnn lies msnbc lies they all lie election manipulation and interference to try and stop trump from running and winning again this is so sick biden is demented and should be removed from office
dng my boy said secret meeting from the people who are being messed by russiathe people who have been robbing us for years needing our help finally paying up
16 soldiers died under bidens watch but he was too busy staring at his watch to care
biden reads from a monitor every question known in advance what a joke
there is not enough wealth to fix social security we need americans to have babies we could confiscate all the wealth or make them pay their fair share whatever that means and it wouldnt be near enough what is biden talking about
biden is so out of it why is he our president
i needed to use 100 of my brean to understand biden
is this real or ai created i feel bad for all my american friends
10334 and that is how he looks at india always without understanding other factors and reality
how tf did you prefer this guy over trump
watching from outside america i think voters on both sides should also consider rfk jr maybe an independent is what the people need right now in the debate he held along side this one he gave interesting analysis of this debate and layed out some interesting ideas
these oldies need to retire
i dont even know which fact is more saddening than the other the first one is that my country hungary keeps electing an idiot for 14 years or the second where the usa has these two other idiots to chose
this is the best stand up comedy i have seen so far
ive only watched a few minutes but so far theyre both just saying the other one did something bad with no elaboration
love how quiet trump is when bidden speaks because trump knows that he will win its an easy win for trump
the world is a stage also teleprompter much
taxing the rich doesnt work we need a trickle down from good business
everyone know republic and democrats have better candidates than them but they chose this 2 old poor men
the fact these two argued about golf near the end has me dying
the dems are playing us
gotta love bringing your golf game in the middle of your debate
what a joke hard to believe either of these guys are capable of running our country i couldnt even finish watching this debate is so bad on both sides they sound like children
the ideathe idea
cap rents and reduce prices of housing why 4 years later weve been sending money over seas hand over fist
what about gaza
biden can say anything and he chooses to close with trumps height and golf game
the corporatemainstream media lied and lied repeatedly concerning bidens dementia and the democrats purposefully misled united states citizens period
the whole debate biden trump
electing biden it will be a global disaster not just for america
is it really between these two i wish november never comes
remind me how biden was the most voted for president in us history what are you americans doing
biden keeps saying if im elected i will blah blah you have been president and you could be doing all of the things you say now and you didnt
yeah they were crazy for leaving these comments open another reason why they didnt have live people at this one like they did the time before is because they would be cheering trump on like no other and it would have looked so much worse for the democratic side
i cannot believe what i just watched to think that was a debate for the presidency of the greatest nation on earth scary
word of the night in history
the look biden gives to trump
were cooked
no one fears america anymore because of the back biting happening amongst your leaders you are slowly loosing your grip on the world america because of choices of leaders you keep giving to the world both these guys are americans but they are not debating issues but attacking themselves like an american vs a muslim
whoever lose def leaving the country
17million views phew
sleepy joe has got to go he shouldnt have been in there in the first place
trump was right on one thing im not even american but afghanistan was an embarrassment the way the us handled it
biden is spitting out statistics with incredible accuracy at his age his train of thought is incredible trump is younger but his lack of statistics and facts does show that he is not presidential biden when i get to your age i want to be able to spit out statistics as you do
ive watched sleepy joe say and the idea that ramble ramble rambleprobably 80 times so far and im not even halfway through ive clocked it
its amazing how long biden could hold his eyes open without blinking
me as a swedish european
i can spend 100 at the grocery store and leave with 2 bags that amount used to fill a cart those stats are waaaaaay off
2220 trump actually called him brandon
american you just need to stop the debate just make trump the president and youll save a lot of money use that to save the american economy save money save timeunless you guys still want biden the person who can lost even in his own house
may i say that this exactly what i expected from a person who has dementia
their reaction i mean their faces were so hilarious
i still stand with black families for this
biden doesnt even look real he looks like a wax statue from ripleys believe it or not
11132 this is the highlight of this debate
i dont know who is the present president compared to mrbiden mrtrump is very perfectly speaking whenever mr trump is speaking mrbiden expressions are
yeah america doom if these are our options i like both individualsthis pure comedy for me
biden might have to be buried after this debate
i love joe biddens everything he rarely brinksis he a robort or what
why are all mediators chosen lying about everything this is a favored debate toward jb whom every word he speaks is a lie 1 minute is not enough on any subject
as a chinese i hope trump win
when there is no treat on a nation there is no need for war
212 look at these old fool hes walking like a zombie
tldr trump hes lying biden no u
11626 trump himself bidens mic was off
they are fooling you people this is just ridiculous
you guys are american laughing stocks 2 old folk are frightening one position americans should choose a younger candidate
trump won this simply by having a clear speaking voice joe biden ing jaardscvgv ojnbgggc hhvvvbkklcz kitchen table
shouldnt trumps incitement of the capitol riots and scandals prevent him for rerunning again i think it should
watching this debate from outsidenow i understand why china did not gointo political liberalisation this debate was not highlight of the candidatesbut also signal to other global players that the empire ate the republic
who also slept when biden spoke
its so hard to sit here and watch biden lie i live in america and i can see whats going on right now it is terrible unless you are filthy rich firsthand i am living it
come onnn guys boths of you guys should go to sleep and just forget about the whole thing
these guys a total wast of time serieusly
biden likes the words the idea
all i know is before covid we had money in the bank
he actually didnt do such a terrible job he is confused and he shouldnt be a presidentbut his answers were not so bad bidens
from britain so who the hells been running your country then defo not this guy
this is proof that biden does not deserve to be elected president again
no one biden the idea
you may be sure that the americans will commit to all the stupidities they can that think of plus some that are beyond imagination charles de gaulle
cnn didnt even allow comments why
god created the united states to give the people of the world light entertainment
condolence from hong kong
i am a foreigner and am truly appalled at bidens state he needs to be removed as a candidate and he needs rest seeing his reactions empty sight and slurred speech sounds like he has alzheimers or dementia very poor choice of candidate trump truly tore him to pieces some people say this debate was fun i say it was horrifying
so you are in a state where you want to destroy yourself a good man who is true to his word you must give iraq weapons to defend yourself such as tanks fighter aircraft antitank missile launchers antitank missiles combat helicopters and other various weapons i am only asking as a friend who is loyal to a friend and for help relationships may be different but never nansa never forgot her allies
what language should i learn to understand biden
where are the biden supporters hiding
a boy walks into the natural history museum do you know where the fossils are he asks the curator in the whitehouse she replies
does anyone notice that mr biden speaks unclearly
i cant stop laughing
im pro choice chat
bob is an unemployed veteran born and bred in the south bronx hes living off the streets down in east la residing in a cardboard box now he plays a little guit and he has a small dog searching for aluminum cans and he holds on tight to his dignity he was born into american life
dumb and dumber latest update
that biden entrance
this almost makes me feel bad for biden
the idea
brendon you should ask him
i cant believe anybody would vote for biden
t should have arrested hillery
funny old men time to retire both
who can solve the ethnic right of rohingya muslim and palestinian
waiting for erb to make biden pop out of a coffin for this one undertaker style
shame bring in rfk already lets hear him vs trump if trump is so great and untouchable he should have refused to debate unless rfk was on the show what a weak day for trump
people who thinks biden actually makes decisions at all are the most delusional
i can analyze this in three words we are fked
higher import tariffs buying more american made
i thought that joe speaks without mistakes only when he is hitting on ten year old girls thats impressive joe full sentences most of them wow
the us should be ashamed of themselves with a president like biden you guys are insane
the economy was great with trump if a president wants to help medical costs i would have medical insurance companies compete with prices of coveragemedication prices and the cost of procedures this no compete just charge the max is ridiculous what other business get the luxury of not competing with out business for you money
mr biden youre the best
they are just arguing with each other publicly instead of answering and making sure about tackling the problems
this crazy inflation is due to the combined percentage of americans and undocumented immigrants who voted for an incompetent old leader for their own agenda it is due to their poor choice that most people around the globe are experiencing this crazy inflation trump is right that war wouldnt have happened if biden hadnt won we wouldnt be experiencing this bs inflation if the war had never happened in the first place
i must say that i really struggled to understand what president biden was talking about during this debate and my mom is american so i got used to hear english a lot while growing up
bideb trump is gonna destroy democracy ha ha you are destroying our ciubtry
were is rfk jr tho
all the americans please vote donald trump the inflation migrant crisis crime rise and many other things happen under biden these are just facts
why does biden sound move and talk like someone who never recoverd from a stroke
i cant believe the comment section is still open and the public is actually allowed to give their input
biden bye then
never knew a corpse could talk
biden was dementing even before he got in fgs not that trumps any better with his ramblings and mad ravings god help the world with this presidential race
if you arent even competent enough to form sentences you probably shouldnt be president
this cnn debate was cunducted in very fair way they treat biden like the son that need more support go trump cheers from ireland
why does biden look like confused mortys mugshot
somebody please needs to add canned laughter to this
why does citizens vote for the wrong candidates and voting out the better and then start crying later americans should be wiser now
jos to old to remember lies hes telling the truth lol
my goodness and joe holds the nuclear codes
at this point i could do better as a president and im not even murican
biden is literally the walking dead things were 1000 times better under trump
listening to this debate has confirmed that neither is better than the other
no matter how we see it or how feel about it 34 of bidens debate was trumped furthermore i think brandon sharted himself 12011204 joe great whos gonna wipe my a now
i make 50k a year far from a millionaire the only time i got money back on my taxes was when trump was in office
biden gives hope to people with dementia that one day they could become the president of usa
this will go down in historygood grief
this is a robot
this is a joke what about the usa we dont wanna hear about other countries
from france i feel bad for this man tbh take care of this old man and let him rest already
hope to anything and everything they vote trump
to determine whos the fittest of these two would be interesting to watch them in a boxing ring
the absence of any uap related questions here tells me absolutely everything i need to know
although biden spoke terrible his poiunts were way better than trump i feel trump always drifted from question
deal with the farmers and climate change will be solved
started reading comments before the debate even started i should say im really glad i did
if trump becomes president and he continues to support israel then hes totally out of touch with the peoples of the world he made a massive blunder the last time he was in office by recognising jerusalem as the capital of israel the peoples of this world now know they have a weapon and that is bds boycott divest sanctions and they do not need any politician or government permission its already happening and its having effect shares in all major companies invested in israel have lost millions of dollars and all this by the actions from the ordinary person on the street the rest of the world is watching israel and compare the idf to the nazis is biden the only one not hearing what the worlds saying free palestine free the world
it is not just the usas economy its a global problem not point in blaming each other
biden trump is the worst president in american history trump biden is the worst president in american history i dont whos the worst between them but im sure the other is the second worst in american history
my favorite part is when trump corrects biden on his golf handicap how does trump now more about biden than biden himself
hmm where is robert kennedy
2729 biden is thinking wait what we cant use that lie anymore
pilipino hate bidden much better trump to win for president to stop the issue in wps that manipulate by the administration of bidden
i cannot even wait to president trump to be president
man they dont get obama from under that mask
nato the un and the usa is all one you would be very ignorant to believe it was anything else no matter who else is in nato and un the usa pump the most money into this alliance therefore the usa control all and have the final say
i cannot even watch this im sorry but its too pathetic
manny say that it is a fact that 5g are weapons
but trump trying to keep a straight face was epic
we need an independent third party commenting on the facts they disagree on how is anyone supposed to know who is lying and who is correct without knowing all of the subject matter like this
and using freedom of speech so whats wrong with that
hey im only investigating and researching
are most of all the journalists bought and paid off
journalist should be asking some different questions
5 push ups minimum requirement for state house then mr museveni of uganda will be usa president
remember that time trump stood in front of a closed down church called st johns and he had held up a black book i did not see the word bible on it but maybe the word was there and i just did not see it was trump completing his smackdown on john the new testament was he giving his buddies the green light to go the chabad organization which his advisor his soninlaw belongs to
stop all this pointless debate if you dont lie you aint called a politician joe biden deserves a break from running for president and donald trump deserves another chance in the white house five years is a blink of an eye and hopefully by then you will have someone proper as your president
1549 terrible thing to save babies from being killed
i am so sad that north korean people for not having privilege to see this hilarious joe biden show
trump 2024 and nothing more
10342 trump just thinks about money and not even survival of human kind
that snake poem the silly woman is america thats what trump was telling us all
people ive had so much trouble with so many people not wanting to see through the picture
remember the great apprentice your fired mom and pop shops
i wonder how much money did trump really make off them covid v a c c s
gets in the way arthritis fingers sorry about my spelling
why teump didnt want miney for presidency he new he would make out like a bandit with a fust full of dollars from being daddy mac vac
why you talking about military biden we talking about the people in united states and economy get out biden
trump the whole world is blowing up under him
dont believe the system is rigged do you honestly believe the american people chose these two as their main options for president bipartisanship is a problem campaigns and campaign funding is a problem we tell our kids that even they could become president but we know that is a lie
i hope president trump comes to california to campaign because i know he will be well accepted and received and we are thoroughly done with all of the that the demoncrats have done to us
biden you are the worst president
trump for president vs joethe idea biden
they should play minecraft together already
the world is america no respekt
this was the nail in the coffin for biden
i elect mr best to be the president
thanks to the wall street journal for leaving the comment section open so that we africans can laugh at americans
hhh biden always said the idea the idea the idea hhhh
buydem cant walk off the podium himself and he challenges trump to golf and carry his own bag trump should have said yea but who will carry you
trump didnt answer the question about immigrants
fjb and cnn
biden speech is the worst ever
the look on bidens fizzer when trump said i dont know what he said at the end i dont think he even knows
comedy preformed at its highest
whats really going on that bidens handlers and the mainstream media now allow citizens to see this and even leave the comments section open somethings afoot
he may not be a good president but hes still a human being
what about the economy president biden bad orange man said drink bleach pathetic
i used to rag inbiden pretty hard because hes an embarrassment to this country what is worse he is nit doing well and theyre still using him they do mot care about his wellbeing
president biden is talking much too fast in his cadence of speech while rambling off information in a low soft voice that it is difficult to pick out the facts he is trying to convey he should have talked slower and louder emphasizing the facts he was trying to present expresident trump talked somewhat slower and louder than president biden but much of what he relays is subjective speculation and opinion respectfully i dont think either of them should be running for president
i am european and have watched this debate in its entirety was biden really as bad as everyone said after the broadcast he seems fit to me of course according to his age but he answered every question reacted to trump and got a lot of things right the one lapse that seemed a bit dodgy was perhaps also due to the excitement associated with old age and exhaustion from his many trips abroad if you check all the facts from the debate and the arguments raised biden won hands down its a shame that in retrospect he emerges from this debate as a loser i hope americans make a sensible decision in the presidential election for america and the whole world
guys believe me mr biden he must leave the white house as soon as possible wearing that lovely short and elderly tshirt and enjoying the rest of his life playing golf with obama mr biden not capable to run a small grocery shop not the usa and the world
a thousand trillionares in america
no president has ever said theyd seek retribution because they were doing it anyways at least hes warning everyone but they are having a cat fight
when trump was the president there was peace all around the world after biden became president there is war all around the world peace is lost
times to say goodbye for this people
does anyone else feel like you want to cough really badly when biden is talking
every time trump is asked a question he just goes on some random tangent about something unrelated every time biden is asked a question he says agsh ruehshu eueu
i would love to rewatch this but joe already made me dumber the first time i watched it
why did i get this video on search results for stand up comedy
how did america come from barack obama to this
12328 biden taking a second to remember trumps weight and height
is it censored
having watched the entire debate this is my unbiased opinion trump was speaking with a lot of confidence and calm demeanor meaning either hes a brilliant liar or hes actually being honest biden looked confused most of the time like he was lost in his thoughts the times he was lucid he was extremely defensive and aggravated trump was speaking in metaphors while biden was over exaggerating his claims trump also had an authoritative tone like he was openly scolding biden while biden really didnt know what was going on whether america is ready for a 2nd trump presidency is up for debate literally but one thing is for certain biden is not fit to have a 2nd term both physically and mentally
nothing but garbage out of trumps mouth
when will bidan quit lying
1153 the exact moment that i knew biden was cooked
you are not the most admired country in the world biden many people in europe think that you are the one whos destroying the world with all those wars inflation etc people all around the world are struggling day by day to provide for their familys how dare you talk like you understand and know what it is for familys who do not know how to pay childcare medicalcare new pair of shoes for their children many familys losing their homes because they cant pay their morgage its a shame how rich people try to give us their understanding only by words but no actions we are not stupid
wish theyd answer the questions
biden looks lost just pull the plug and let him retire
honestly russia vs ukraine was not a 0art of usa
the facial expressions are killing me here in nairobi kenya
hi oh boy biden makes me sick
the only good thing for biden here is that he wont remember any of this in an hour or two
gotta love american politics greetings from europe

im all for a fair fight but this isnt it jack
republic law cummunity pastil section platitum economic water
this debate was not about what they were going to do for the country this was two men battling over what they did or didnt do this was a travesty
biden is the best no matter whatfree palestine
what are black jobs lol this dude
this debate was not about what they were going to do for the country this was two men battling over what they did or didnt do this was a travesty

working single parents who cant afford to miss one day of work when they get sick because it will cause major devastation to paying there bills are now being told they make to much and are being cut off food snap assistance and there state medical while everything is more expensive now then it ever has been but biden is so disconnected from reality how a single parent can make to much money when making minimum wage and paying taxes that go to to the programs but they cant afford day to day expenses but yah everything is great in the land of biden
when youre born in this world you get a ticket to the freak show when youre born in america you get a frontrow seat george carlin
the epic quotes that will be used in jokes for generations to come this a snl roasting set
the face of biden everytime he listens to what trump said is just making my day
im no american and i do not live in usa but i hope americans do the right thing to vote for trump the entire world sees america as a laughing stock with the poor decision of american citizens voting biden hate trump all you want he knows how money and economy works
you can see almost the entire west is in crisis and lacks quality leaders
why was the climate issue even brought up this is a non issue and anyone who actually knows anything about this issue is perfectly aware that climate is literally beyond human control if you dont believe that theres a podcast called cosmographia that you can watch if you really want the truth about climate change
putting the playback speed to 025x every time biden talks is so worth it
joe look like gta character
the idea that brandon could continue in office makes me

whos winning this time trump or biden
theres no one else to vote for
any one here from india
democrats defend democracy
you can tell in this video that biden cant comb his hair so its done for him meanwhile trump has been in the rough and it shows yet he looks himself in the mirror
god bless america and let trump win i hope every biden supporter saw him for what he is i took care of my grandma for 5 years every day since she was diagnosed with dementia no one cares about him hes a pawn so scary and so sad i hope americans see this for what it is hes no longer home we have real enemies that want us dead do we not remember 911 wake up we need to be united
this will be looked in 10 years
i think joe biden is being forced to be the president of the usa undoda lowu sekhulile lowu kabamyekele eziphumulele leyi yi abuse abamyenza yona leyi its so sad what they are doing to him kungani kumbe bayamkhawulisa
mr trump is a national treasure
biden is boasting about creating 15 thousand jobs that is nothing compared to all those people loosing their homes jobs and life savings to try and stay afloat under bidens administration enough is enough biden is reading off teleprompts preprepared ways to answer the most basic of questions why is america so much more bad bad bad off since presisent trump was denied another term through the kkk tacktics of the biden administration america needs president trump back in the white house now i was always on the fence about this election but after this debate my vote is for president trump
hes on fantasy island biden is fentanyl isnt down with the borders open its skyrocketed
mr trump please continue to thrive please
subtitles needs subtitles for this
dont worry mr trump us the real and good ones are with you and we see everything
our lives will not be good until the return of jesus
everyone making under 170k pays 6 of their check to taxes what world is that in i pay about 2025 in taxes another 20 for everything else
why is biden reading from notes they arent allowed
vote rfk jr they killed his uncle and his dad and dont allow him to gave secret service its simple guys go vote
donald trump didnt deny joe biden on pulling out of nato
he definitely made that up now apologize to trump
biden is a liar
everyone thinks that we are weak everyone
grandpa on the right is past bedtime
at the beginning you can see the biden is all calm and postured while mr trump is somewhat more moved and emotional even say angry but this is so false and only a good person knows whats going on here see it in a different light compare it with biden some sick institutions who kidnap and rpe children and they play good people see social services in japan vs mr trump a person who knows what their true nature is and is burning with anger at what they do but cannot do anything because law protects them
theyll make ameruca great agaim senator armstrong 2019
why does biden keep taking credit for what trump did in his last term is anyone going to call him on that and biden has not raised the pell grants im a student and receive pell grants and financial aid what a lie
my question is who is planning what is coming to the united states its obvious that something is going down consider all the bright minds coming out of the top universities in the world including harvard yale princeton yet there is not a reasonable candidate running for presidency of the united states what i saw was a couple of bumbling fools who didnt even respect each other enough to call each other by their name or title they ignored questions they babbled they both sounded like idiots who needs saturday night live this was reality tv at its best there is definitely a plan underway and thats why these two bozos were on the stage something is happening and these two bozos are mere puppets in a much bigger plan that us citizens should be seriously talking about
biden sounds like hes always short of breath
my poor mr trump is a man of steel i cant believe how he handles so much
i think the president we has told more lies
at 600 for just a loaf of bread is whats killing people and our economy under trump was awesome compared to what it is under you joe biden you have almost destroyed our country we cant survive another four years under your leadership
i couldnt watch it ever since that robot biden opened its mouth after three minutes into the video insulting my poor mr trump so much when hes just an incompetent
wow im sorry but trump is a joke and biden is underwhelming noone actually wants to make america better
i was waiting until they said i guess we have a winner and here it is folks give a huge welcome to our 47th president and anonymous elected candidate peter griffin
120 buckslol
trump for president to help sa
biden did great i dont see whats the trouble
i actually fell bad for biden hes at a point in his life where im starting to believe he wont survive another term i believe he should live out the rest of his life in a nursing home where he can live his best life he shouldnt be forced to be a puppet for his campaign managers
which dinosaur you guys voting for
biden has really lost it next hell be talking about his uncle getting eaten by cannibals again or something this is sad to watch truly whoever had him participate should be charged with elder abuse including his wife
hahaa does he have allegations to do with the the pstart 75 yr old man
has anyone else tried turning on the captions to make sense of sleepy joe
these two have a lot more animosity towards each other than those ai vids would portray
masons are going full steam ahead in 2024 its crazy batshit insane actually
im not trumpist but biden let me down period
were all doomed
in gods name what is biden saying
biden is such a disaster who is running the country my god
trump mogging while biden was talking
im learning english by listening to the debates of famous people honestly i cant understand what biden said during the debate i have to question my english level many times however trump proved that im not that bad cuz i cant get what he said easily
no we have to step up because you biden as a president fail to
this debate was the greatest thing i have ever seen
the debate is a flop i really am not a impressed by trump but considering he has been tied up in court by that man he is debatingdump biden
good luck for both of you
trump clowned biden point blank
we definitely had the best economy when trump was president im a mexican american that voted for biden i regret it 100 economy sucks he made everything go down bad
everywhere biden goes the population tells him that hes no good my vote gos to trump
biden looks like he is about to fall out
cnn wants to focus on abortion of course
trump you sent those mobs to capital you trump no one else again quit glorifying yourself that was your job thats why y were elected not to make your own rules
stop this is so entertaining
is this cnn or comedy central
ive saw many videos of people squatting in hotels and stuff its messing up our country we need to worry about our people first
biden cant even answer the question about whether its acceptable or not
joe wouldnt know he vets noone
i like theway trump defend biden should not even stand from drc congo
all things aside i am not american but when biden instinctively brags and flexes with how the us have the finest military in the world and whatnot shows me a warmonger that uses military might as a crutch to stand on his demeanor and choice of words thats not the type of attitude i want of the strong thank you
the right way to go is not to sneak across the border
from this debate none of yall are fit to be president of the united states
the idea that bidens response to questions he remembered practicing the whole previous week is remarkably obvious in his expression tone and tempo when biden is reminded he still has 80 seconds to finish his answer is dumbfounded
at 2950 trump says when putin saw that he said you know what i think were going to go in and take my this was his dream i talked to him about it his dream if you vote for trump youre voting for a guy who claimed on national television that putin told trump that his greatest dream in the world is to invade ukraine and you would think that if oh trump and putin seem like close buddies if they can talk about goals and ambitions together perhaps trump could offer some constructive criticism to putins ideas especially if putin respects trump so much obviously this didnt happen but if it had then that means theyre just chatting each other up and daydreaming about their ambitions together like either way were talking about a guy who lied on national television with the goofiest statement you could make up or a guy who has evening chats with an evil dictatorwar criminalmass murderer were so cooked bro
corporate greedthe miltary industrial complex that is sucking billions of tax dollars isnt corporate greed according to sleepy joe joes statistics are bs
this is better than any comedy found on netflix just realistically sad however
forget about the cannibals that aid his family member
no baby should be murdered in the third trimester
the covid i skibidi with 1153
trump you dont respect no onehe as your debating with is your commander and chief we dont care what you approvedthats the past all youve done is instigating your mob to attack the capitaland overthrow our government
trump has given us nasty truth but they are truebiden has clearly lied about multiple things and then denies lying about it for me once just saying
and people would still double down for either of them like bro choose someone else we had options why double down
poor biden has been annihilated by trump biden is done
biden reminds me of a friend of mine my friend is a drunk and talks exactly like this he talks in circles and cant hardly understand what he says and cant keep a straight thought
my grandma is past 90 she speaks more clear than biden and doesnt fall asleep while doing it biden is a mummy who forgot he already died
two hundred years there were slavery and half the nation thought it was a good thing we fought a war over it just because it was doesnt make it right
biden campaign made a soda 3 trump gave everyone a tax break i could actually afford to live
sleepy joe im a kenyan why dont we organize a whitehouse visit by gen z
youre not reducing the price of squat joe
biden is moved by a controller
this whole debate is circus show with biden being the worst clown the world have ever seen
there is only one candidate fit to be president in 2024 robert f kennedy jr
i hope biden wins cause america is falling and hell boost the process
congrats usa you did the sequel no one asked for i learned to appreciate the last jedi now
is biden in the same debate or is his only response thats all lies
anyone who gets mad and resorts to name calling because biden has no better come back because hes empty headed all in front of the american public thats the only thing he good come back with because he ran out of ammunition if he ever had some to begin withn and whats worse if he steps down from office look whats next in line now you tell me what kind of leader is that
prince philip vs annoying orange
dont blame a clown acting like a clown ask yourself why you keep on going to the same circus and blame yourself
trump is way too hilarious when hes constantly mocking biden
you have the morals of an alley cat biden
while joe biden talking about child care elderly care is going downhill that biden slipped out of the elderly home
from germany i feel really disgusted by the american people and media for live showing the disastrous effects of decadelong corruption and criminal activities causing dementia affecting this poor old man next to the president of the united states donald trump the family especially the wife of this other elderly man should be ashamed to use the sickness of their relative to profit
biden closing statement is the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life with his face expression and his stuttering i cant
guess who
in that debate between biden and trump you just ran into a strategy called gishgalloping where in a debate you say many infactualities faster than all of the other people conducting that debate can factcheck you on all of them before the limited time allotted for that debate runs out if one of the two debaters is willing to use the tactic of gishgalloping then the gishgalloper from the standpoint of a troubling number of bystanders watching will always rhetorically fully win that debate and any debate the downside to using gishgalloping to gain rhetorical autowins in any debate is that the night after factcheckers finally finish their rundown of all of the infactualities told during your gishgallop you lose an incredible amount of the trust people had in you for all people that hear and believe what the factcheckers have to say about your gishgallop for all days after that debate i hope this pokes some holes in trusting debate results
i actually feel sorry for joe biden its hard to watch
women still cannot make own decisions on abortion in the 2024 states its just ridiculous
he can barely speak hes family is using him by pushing him out there i feel bad for biden desiring to be president for so long and so many years and than getting it when really your too old to handle the weight of the job
as a blacktino from chicago i will vote trump 2024
i feel like this is closer to an snl skit of a presidential debate than it is an actual presidential debate
127128 was trump at his finest the look on bidens face says it all
white house no when white acres nursing home lets a resident out for the evening
12650 joe biden face had me dying while im trying to keep a straight face at work

cnn couldnt even control the narrative on this one its so bad
well its nice to see that biden can still count to 3
im speechless only jon stewart can get me through this fiasco
what about the failed burisma with ukraine and what was said between zelensky and president biden the times that zelensky came to the white house all of that should have been on the news for the american people to hear
am i the only one genuinely frightened by how biden looks at 2139 its just so unnerving the turn the blank stare idek
joe got way to high before this debate
4 ipas and 3 shots of tequila biden would beat me close
neither of them deserve to be president most of the presidents have been bad and rubbish evil or racist
u right president he cant stand to lost and next time mr president dont fall for his level u bigger then that that what he want for u to fall for his level
wow as a viewer in this debate presjoe biden is the he winner

bidens a nonfactor now msm divided america and must be fixed or else america will fall trump 2024
are they seriously debating about whos the best golfer
well whoever is talking in biden ear reminds me of obama and pelosie sorry but i ve heard that before or he has been around them so much that he is starting to sound like them all i really heard were two grown men throw slurs at each other trump had reasons to cause biden was wrong on a lot he said cause it was not true and the american people knew that but biden didnt i feel sorry for biden because we have known for some time that he has the beginning stages of dementia if you had a grandparent or grandparents and uncle and aunts with it you dont forget the beginning or the end of it i hope he gets help for it and in a comfortable place that is if his family does the right thing by him you two did a very good job tonight and we thank you trump does love america and he loves the american people and the american people love him god bless you all
am i the only one here to look for bidenrelated memes here
to the american people if you have to choose in one of them to be your next president let pick trump then close your eyes and pray to god
i pray for the americans may god bless you with trump
donald had officially dropped his trump card and in the process did uno reverse moves every time joe biden speaks
whos here for the comments
there are bigger problems in the world than debating who was the worst president
i think trump did a horribly debating i am surprised how he was talking about things when he has lots of benefits to sharp his points but but bidens performance made trump seems had a great job lol
i love the golf argument at a debate lol 12351 12427
this is painful to watch as an outsider how the people of there country feeling can only imagine
answer the questions
good i watched the debate to remind myself i have to vote wow how many time the moderators had to say the question was that trump is deaf or crazy
i think we can all agree that there must be an age limit for the presidency or else well have more talks that belong to the retirement home this is pure and sad entertainment btw 2122 was gold xd
i love this video
i love this video
1643 did biden really say that a lot of young women have been ra by their brothers and sisters to support his case for abortion you cant make this craziness up this isnt funny its scary
mark my words this country will see the wrath of god like never before because a lot of people dont follow his rules of order that was ordained by god on all issues about life and how to live
no democrats watching this rerun where are they they need to get educated
the idea the idea come on
life was so much better when president trump was in office
shame on biden for taking a hit from a joint right before the debate
biden taking credit for people going back to work
no one boasts like gaston no one fires like gaston no one scowls and insults like gaston
joe biden lied people trump never said nazis were good people i watched that charlettville speech biden lied lied lied
trump your service is no longer needed for us
i am canadian but i love these us debates i wish the same was done in canada
ive watched this debate several times what ive noticed is how the moderators cut biden off when he gets himself into trouble very unfair we should be allowed to see both candidates for who they are not right and very biased
the guilt is showing on bidens face everytime trump talks lol we have a winner
aunt clara from bewitched we thought funnythisnot so much unless youre from china or russia
161 presidential scholars are just high school kids
trump trump trump i got a kick out of this trump is the best hysterical
cant even tell whats true when they start every rebuttals saying thats not true liar
the truth is im the only president this century that doesnt have any this decade that doesnt have any troops dying anywhere in the world joe biden 13 soldiers were murdered by a suicide bomber at the hamid karzai international airport on august 26 2021 in the rushed and chaotic withdrawal from afghanistan that was ordered by president biden
joe has had 3 12 years to fix ss he hasnt
it seems joe biden is in hangover from last night
wish i was black free downpayment for a house day care cut in half forgiving student loans sounds like reperarions are in full affect
hitting the pause at mountfeesencewhat ever that is as a vet dont even get me started on the health care situation stationed with gurneys of asbestos and then camp lejeune
what else trump did you have that conversation recorded what about myself sitting at the movie theater earlier
watching the walking dead joe biden mumble and stumble over his week long practiced responses was sickening and terrifying for the people of the united states lets go brandon
every time trump is talking biden is zoning out you can just see it in his eyes
so 1 million for the veterans and 15 million to black collages and trillions to other countrys
lets talk about my student debt that was supposed to be helped out you still going to do that biden its been four years you liar
still digesting the comments
heavenly father we ask that the best man to lead the country be the one elected in november in the name of jesus
anyone tired of relying on presidents to get things done for ourselves
im already passed off joe is a liar
why does biden keep acting like he got hit by infinite void
sure seemed like joe biden was reading a whole lot of notes not permitted from the rules listed at this timestamp 155 yet another example of rules for thee and not for me
trump 2024 so proud of him completely destroyed biden man to man and with class bravo ty justices for granting immunity i understand exactly why you did it give us our country back
straight to comments thats me
i like how trump doesnt jot dont notes during the debate he speaks off the cuff some of his stuff is scripted but most is not they are just words flowing from his mouth they seem so much more genuine than your career politician his style might be the best but you cant argue with the exults against subpar debaters like biden
biden would play a perfect mr burns from the simpson
trump rumbled while brandon mumbled
joe biden is destroying everything good in this country
i am apolitical and not a trump fan so my opinion is based solely on logic i feel so sorry for president biden but after watching this debate this poor man hasis being exploited trump didnt need to be on the stage cnn could have just asked president biden the questions and the outcome would have been the same please give this man some dignity and have him respectfully step down
i feel so bad for the democratic party dementia took my mothers life last year however her face looked much better her eyes more aware and her speech more intelligible than bidens lord have mercy upon us all
biden obviously has parkinsons symptoms we give weapons to ukraine not money although biden sometimes loses his train of thought trump doesnt seem good at logical thinking and tends to only target and blame his competitor
biden is so dumb to be world leader
1205 at this point trump should have said ill forfeit the rest of my time to let him speak to the american people lets go brandon
i dont think biden knows how to tell the truth anymore
arguing over their golf game reminds me of judge smails and ty in caddyshack
218 the walking dead
shoulda asked joe how its possible for his son to get caught with child pornography on his laptop witch lead to a much more bigger n more disturbing outcome sumet about a child trafficking ring was itbeen a minute since ive looked up that scumbag ild like to know how he got away with that joen what are your thoughts on itlike father like son ild say
i saw a tik tok and i came straight to see this show
explains the countless amountsof carrier planes coming into sa
he mumbles too much i dont understand him as much
im not from us i watch this for my ged
biden never denied the laptop or have a statement about all our money they are sending and swindling americans
joe biden si a lierhave ssi and i never got a rise since joe biden got in office my rent wen up jajaja worst administraci√≥n ever for people in disability
i wish we had trump in canada because he really does want what is best for the united states the only thing that i dont agree with trump is allowing people to kill innocent animals and this is for any man no man or government should have the say what a woman wants to do with her body just like no woman should have any say what a man does with his body no man can understand what a woman goes through and vice versa
i feeling like its a stand up comedy show
1625 including his kin
take a shot every time trump says billion
im part of the middle to low class and i was doing great when trump was in office and i was making 18 an hour now im making 27 an hour and can barely pay my bills and cant afford food anymore im on raymon and hotdogs now and i was eating steak when trump was in office
joe biden cannot stop lying lying and lying you vacation hard you never work hard for america not even for one minute you are destroying this country
facing reality has been democrats weakness forever
biden is the biggest liar of all times followed by trump usa be lookin real good
the whole wide world is watchingmay the man w the kindest heart wins
biden is so dumb if he thinks this country is respected we was til he became president but since his time in office hes destroyed that
biden is the worst president ever period no one has been as bad as biden has hes so bad it should be criminal and he should be arrested for our border crisis
dana bash covertly trying to help biden focus his attention properly tells you everything you need to know about the media
biden almost got lost walking to the podium
how is it that in this day and age these are my top 2 candidates
the idea joe blew it was overreported yes a more visible brain fart and more of them than trump dawg but this was dem ideas versus republican ideas of course thats not a flashy clip take
next 4 year s president america turamp
snow miser vs heat miser
i just want prices to go down who ever can get it done doesnt matter to me just get it done
its like they are playing tag ok your turn to tell me i am lying we all want to think we are right but at the end of the day its only about making the usa better for all of the americans
please stop it donald hes already dead
trumps like that kid that comes over your house playing with your toys and leaves you to clean the mess up
trump 2024 we going all the way
so fun watching sleepy joes face during this debate how nice of the commentators to save biden every time he starts to struggle
two geriatrics who are clearly unfit to be president being our only options is just ridiculous america is a joke
biden simply isnt prepared to deal with a gish gallop doesnt matter if what trump says is 100 true or not never shouldve taken a debate
best president democratic amd religious catholic best fo all is joe biden god bless you if your oponent win just relax your journey is finish donth think so much give it to god i know amerika is a good people choos to help not a greedi like china people and russiathanks you biden
do the candidates secretly sit during this
ok america youve had your laugh now where are the real candidates
my family did great under president trump and now look everything high etc etc since bubblehead has been in office trump 2024
the beauty is that trump did all this in the enemy territory all the odds were against him and he came out on top this debate clearly showed biden is a sucker and a loser 2709
russia now has a better standard of living and safer communities
joe knows people change circumstance change and bottom line change biden will useful acclamate pre successor bills four more years for president joe biden
i can just imagine biden chatting with his wife early in the morning wait jill can you remind me which button is the nuke and which one is for a cup of coffee
baseless insults donny
they talk aboit taxes likr 25 is low spending is way way too high
we live in a twilight world
president biden has tottal imunity acording to the court said and biden has the right to accept it as for him
rfk won this debate
trump 2024 make america great again
why pbd on wsj
biden is diluted he has no clue about anything
donny like treason
vote independent
yes i would go after biden is corrup
im watching to see why tf my electric bill 142 a month in a apartment
worse debate in the history of america voteindependant
just few minutes in this debate i cant stop myself laughing this is a joke the quality of this debate is not even half at par with barack obama vs mitt romney debate
law enforcement that are backing trump need a psychological examination evaluation
biden is such a good politician says a lot but doesnt mean much
cnn communist network new or corruption new network
the wall was supposedly fully funded for the next presidential office
im not a american but i lost my english after this debate
trump won this debate
biden sounds also terrible when he spoke its making people has a hard time to understand his words and starts to mumbling
donald just doesnt know
when i lie i feel horrible about it joe border patrol
president joe biden just whipped donny big time
trumph is for good thing biden for terrible thing which way you would choose
even the most liberal people i know say this economy is horrible everything is expensive
127 that white suite looks good on her
he beat medicare he beat it to death
trump was spot on
trump will sell america to the russians or chinese really any billionaire to make money our constitution will be ripped to shreds if he becomes president again trump is a threat to the american idea god bless the joe biden administration who work hard to keep the american idea alive
12926 12958 speaking of whining not accepting the results of a fair legitimate and legal election etc hillary hillary hillary
biden is a mess cant finish a sentence doesnt make any sense at all how can they make biden suffer like that
i am a monument to all your sins
why would black people get all these breaks but not everyone else
let rfk in the next debate
joe clearly knew the first question beforehand he had a response pre prepared it was oddly delivered mostly jumbled he piecing together parts of his prepared answer in the wrong order how did he get questions beforehand
what about immigration on the border does it feel like benefical or needless
now we know where trump got the page from them and thats what trump is trying to do
joe with 1 foot in the grave
did they take an oath
this is edited i saw the debate
their sound system is outdated
the fact of the matter is yall if i hear that one more time i swear
hearing trump tell us that he offered to provide additional protection against an insurrection is chilling twelve fellow honest hardworking americans who take jury duty very seriously wouldnt you were given facts that the rest of us will probably never see in one place and they found trump guilty of helping to incite the insurrection now we know trump wanted to be both the hero and villain why is that not comforting
trump must be deaf if he doesnt know what biden is saying im hearing him perfectly fine
biden just getting one vote shows how sick the country is who the f is out there filling in biden on the ballot
i dont think there timeing
biden were bablhokanchak ovda unidedztatez number one number two yorethe suker
long live iran
what in the world did i just watch it was like 2 geriatrics revert to their time in elementary school uh uh you suck no you suck
trump is just beating around the bush and never answers the questions i cant understand why the moderators dont stop him put him in place hes a narcissist
when the usa held back its help because of trump the death toll in ukraine went up the land mass of ukrainian went down and the time the conflict went up so you can see the tip of leadership that will not work with trump just as the mass withdrawal of troops from afghanistan with people falling from the outside of the plane the was evacuating troops from a war against democracy taliban that trump ran from because he is a chicken and did not hand over the the un as a defensive but let the dictatorship rule and rain
why is biden wearing a ear piece he is being coached
im having a hard time understanding 80 of bidens dialogue he sounds like hes asleep nobody saw his condition prior to this debate unbelievable
i really feel for biden he seems to be in pain
how could biden possibly get confused while reading a teleprompter script anybody could follow their head eye movements head at 23 set points pupils tracking lr biden answered nothing he read how come not 1 source points out the stark fact that the debate was scripted read cuz it makes joe look even worse uniparty we were tricked into thinking this was a classic spontaneous debate else why no live audience
youtube stop delete my comments
dear god help and save our country weve already passed cooked and are currently being deep fried
ihave never see adebate like this no audience you guy doing all of thisfor buden this m i s sick
ukrainian forces are experiencing big ammunition shortages as us military aid is stalled the hungarian prime minister has repeatedly drawn strong criticism from fellow eu leaders for maintaining close ties with russian president vladimir putin ever since he launched a fullscale invasion of ukraine on 24 february 2022 unlike many other western nations mr orban refuses to send weapons to its neighbour ukraine stating repeatedly that kyiv is unable to win against a nucleararmed russia eu leaders are increasingly concerned that a second trump presidency would see a significant reduction in us military and financial aid to ukraine and also the nato military alliance a 95bn 75bn foreign aid bill including 60bn in military assistance to ukraine has been stalled in us congress because of republican opposition the republicans openly encouraged by mr trump say they will not allow the bill to clear the final hurdle in the house of representatives without first agreeing additional funding for us border security at a rally last month he told supporters the cash should be loaned rather than given without strings they want to give them 60 billion more do it this way loan them the money if they can make it they pay us back russian forces have recently made gains in eastern ukraine as kyiv experiences acute shortages in ammunition ukraine is critically dependent on weapons from the us the main supplier and other western allies to keep fighting russia a much bigger military force with an abundance of artillery ammunition
english is not my mother tounge but i have no problem with understanding trump to hear biden start with a lie is probably what should be expected we can all testify that the economy was great under trump i dont know what chaos biden talks about if its not the chaos he himself has created in europe and elsewhere it must be something the old boy dreamt up
why is the media trying take more put of the debate than what they have been told by the white house staff the media is harassing the president and his staff over this debate
biden confuses me babies in cages to boarder control its time to retire friend
biden will win easily
worst obama
i love how the reporters tried so hard to side with biden and give trump a hard time just like last time but it failed even worse than it did last time that being said both of these guys really do suck
the debate was a 15 hr cheap fake according to the white house as the far right intercepted the broadcast signal and faked the whole event this has been confirmed by misinformation experts never question main stream media
biden straight up loses his train of thought 6 sentances deep
all those dead people that voted for biden should be ashamed
theres never been anything like it yea sure donald
look biden american people want our freedoms back the ones being taking away slowly i believe more people notice than what you think
the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea
my question where are the fact checkers where are the reports detailing the factuality or fraudulency of all the statements these two made thats their job the press job is to keep government honest every time any politician says anything a reporter should be there to record it and if what the politician says is false in any way in any degree it is the reporters duty to report on that where is that
more border patrol does not mean turning away folks to joe its faster processing
donald trump deserves to win
my god is this guy for real people need better education
trump is correct about ww3 oh never ever think something cannot happen on your own home ground
he did not indite you criminal the law did just like the song you broke the laws and the laws won and all government leaders are not above the law just do what you wont russia tin as trumps stated
this country is a business do you want a ceo with their own money or one who only wants money dont be vindictive when you vote either vote for the best candidate or not at all
i have no sympathy for biden hes been a crooked terrible politician his whole life his comment against maga republicans is extremely insulting why would i support someone that has completely alienated half the country trump 2024 the peoples president
cnn communist network new or corruption new network
imagine if bruce buffer introduced them
biden is half alive 1130 he starts off ok and then just trails off into nonsense dudes barely awake looks at trump sometimes like hes a unicorn just amazed he cannot actually be making actual legal decisions he cant even go to the bathroom without help
please let handsome joe take rests he is stressful and tired
biden called trump out of his name shameful it thats all hes got go president trump
he will be covicted when he step out of officehe deals with his 10 a big man
idiocracy is predicative programming
i have never laughed so much as i have in this debate trump is asked a question and he never answers it because hes too busy degrading biden what a joke
trump exaggerates a lot
tell me why children are having children
wow no no he has done nothing
biden sounds like the english finals
best podcast ever
who just went to the comments
grocery bill utilities bill childcare bill car bill insurance bill every single bill went up 100 i cant even save money anymore like i used to its just sad
at the end trump should lead and let biden be effective opposition leader
bad or worst choose
im not on trumps side but at least i can understand half the words hes saying meanwhile biden is literally decaying by the second
bidens wife is a horrible person for letting her husband make a fool of himself let him rest and enjoy his last years with his family what a horrible horrible wife
biden has no business being potus this debate makes it clear that biden is not mentally sound
jan 6th set up
this is hilarious
trump for president
america having trump again as the president mmm i wondering what is going to be like lots of insults more arrogance and many many locker rooms talk
havent seen these jobs available have seen that just buying a milk its no longer 7 its 8 now sales tax just saying
biden needs to hire a realtor cause he movin
cnn is the greatest antisemitic spreader
every time trump is about to speak ads pop up
wow biden kept calling trump names no name calling from trump
as a normal functional person this is both incredibly funny and absolutely terrifying
fjb it trump2024 mother flowers
11225 11235 nobody wants to screw around with us joebama is that why russian nuclear missile submarines are just off of the florida coast is that why china is slowly cutting off taiwan and threatening to invade it isnt taiwan one of our allies is that why ccp warships are cruising really close to australia one of our allies in what is called sabrerattlling none of these things happened under president trumps term in office compared to you joebama
biden cant focus long enough to complete a thought before bleeding into another and stumbling conversationally both coming and going the former doesnt even address his compunction to lie with every tale
see i like trump but im from los alomos tijuana and where not all dangerous people
when biden talk about wealthy people effective tax rate shows he doesnt understand tax system in us wealthy people are tax through the businesses they owned that does not reflect in their personal tax
the idea the idea that the last election wasnt rigged in favor of boe jiden is the most ludicrous we must have voter id requirements and no mail in ballots unless strict rules are in place handicapped elderly military etc the last election was the first in history where you didnt know the winner the night of the election and over night it turned into a absolute cluster fk
its like a tv show
the movie idiocracy was way underestimating the degeneration of the us you are done
that dude biden is high as gassssss
what is this americans
im not a republican but i like trump
the debates usually start in september maybe august the democrats set biden up and now america knows hes an egg plant running the most powerful nation on earth they know they have to replace him and they couldnt wait until september
i dont think bidens medication kick into 5th geari think it went 5th gear in reverse
im hunkering down for the sept 10th second debate
crooked joe what about the millions that passed the border under your administration
is it me or didnt they say no note cards or help aids at the podium yet biden had an entire podium full of help aids before he even got to the podium he probably had the questions with notes ahead of time and still screwed up this was so one sided entertaining yet hard to watch at the same time and biased too
they sound like kids arguing the reporters are more serious
golf talk 12300 youre welcome
trump farted at 11626ish i swear
btden had a cold not once did he wipe his nose lol
biden sure has a strange resting face this guy should be enjoying his retirement at this stage of his life not slowly dying in front of the world stage
when dr jill asks dementia joey to come to bed he blurts out im coming hillary i have to change my diaper first
ok so i am not from the us but at 1025 trump stated that the world is laughing at americans because off joe biden yea we are laughing at americans but we started laughing when americans elected trump as president we knew then american is a joke the joke just continued with biden facts
the only bright side to come out of one of these two winning will be the south park episode
its pretty clear which of these two the country needs at this moment in our history
trump is our president
every time joe looks dazed and confused they take the camera off him
biden is lying
you can see within the first minute joe waves at an empty studio then looks around for one its over
trump was 10000 right with everything he said
poor biden he is really too old to be president now such a difference between now and the debate in 2020
biden barely knows hes president
this man cannot even give a cognitive change unless we wake up to what is really going on
1159 fax coming in
i dont think biden knows whats happening
from 100 to 120 to usa but in canada from 100 to 180
does he want to go his grave while in office
actually i am learning english but biden didnt speak in english why i didnt get anything from him but trump is clear
oh side track the lie joe 13 dead in afganist√°n while leaving billions of equipment for ou r enemys joe is a lyer
i am shocked that cnn was fair for this debate they have been orange man bad for 8 years now this
close the border
opponent mic will be turn off thats explain everything who and what kind those people are
its official biden is a better golfer than 995 of the golfers on the planet but cannot walk up a set of stairs or ride a bike hes offically a real liar
the fact that a lot of these controlled media networks rate trump one of the worst presidents soley because of the indictment charges and not because of performance in office tells me a lot about who theyre really working for
someone said every time biden looks at trump hes seeing him for the first time
between the two trump is a far better leader thats all i have to say and that biden acts worse than a child
the problem is we know now that no election is fair honest anymore even if we voteamericademocracy
1936 he doesnt even know the terms of the laws hes trying to pass he is brain dead
with due respect biden should be vacation ing enjoying life and not all this stress this is a toll on him i hope he doesnt fall again this is a lot for him to handle hes tired
12706 yeahok tell that to the everdeclining enlistment and retention rates in our military
we the people stand by trump we are truly disgraced by biden
we all know the numbers if biden somehow wins they will try and overthrow the government trump is 100 going to be the next president unless they try and kill him
a family of 4 groceries cost 28000
were proud of you former president trump father almightys blessings be with you forever
omg heaven help meafter listening to the whole discussionthe fact that so many are willing to listen to a 4th grader whine about anything based on nothing and exhort each point baselessly remains remarkable in itself heaven help us as a nation if this type of discourse is a recurrent allowancewe are doomed if such is a our current reality
we love trumppp
being president of united states of america is the greatest hall of fameyou could be a member ofthat means your selfish legacy has been completed because there are only 46 men that can claim that tremendous featdead or alive
i would like to see a list of each candidates exagerations and outright untruths like biden saying no soldiers dies during his term in office what about the 13 in afghanistan what about biden saying he inherited a bad economy the numbers say much different biden claims new jobs but those jobs were covid rebounds
average presidential debate tries to grasp ideas and policies this one tries to grasp words and mouth sounds
thanks for confirming that rfk is the best candidate in 2024
im sorry groceries are still going up you cant buy much for 10000 its gone up more then 20 percent
the moderators were fair the after debate analysis didnt include allot of spin the comments were left open knowing how it was gonna be received these jackals havent been fair or cared about the truth for a decade and a half you should wonder why they do now
watching from the philippines
what is biden doing flipping paper i thought note were not allowed and what about the souind recording that picked up someone communicating with biden during the debate
11521 am middle class and i had 10k when trump was president then biden came and im negative 200
if voting mattered they wouldnt let us do it
this has to be a comedy skit someone is pulling your leg
biden need to go asap
are you sure this not just another saturday night live parody
trump they call it border crime but i call it biden crime biden
know if two parents have to work they shouldnt have to play with tax credits and things like that they should be able to just bring their children to a child care center and it be paid for by our government after all isnt it our tax dollars that pay for everything yeah thats a loaded question that aint true either taxes do nothing folks but zero out other accounts that have already been opened when people like the united corporations of america dont pay their fair share of taxes thats when it gets hairy folks were a fiat monetary system there is no taxes that literally pay for anything in this country we simply use taxes to zero out an account somewhere and we create new money every single year and the feds spends it into existence the biggest problem is none of you folks know how to access that money
its not true he is a good man
putins stance on ukraine is completely valid if the sovereignty of his countrys border is threatened by a military presence every president has the right to intervene if you disagree then allow russia to have military bases in cuba or mexico its that simple people
well if the people that vote believes that your vote countthat is factsbut if you believe once you vote for a republican or democrat and you control them that is false
remember in the 2020 election biden mentioned how trump would act when he loses the election biden says well see what your s are when this election is over with a facial exclamation get ready the dems or should i say socialists are up to no good again
themoststupidwordsthathaveeverhappened rfk wasnt invited thats so funny your power is faltering your end is now
a war that is funded by the alphabet selected and without incrimination state needs to end
what was the odds on biden forgetting what he was saying
biden is driving the world into ww3
no biden that was under obamas administration about the kids in cages
utilizing grammar associated with a 4th grader and utilizing repetition of such as a manner of retoricheaven help us
what a pity they could have allowed biden to sit down at least he is too old i dont think he felt at ease when standing up for so long minutes he is tired indeed and this can be noticed through his voice trump is still strong despite his being old america got incredible talents
a 78 year old criminal vs an 81 year old how are either of these people an option its an embarassment to america to be showing this debate when both just need to retire one has a violent cult following and the other can barely talk what even is this neither should be the leader of our country we need someone to uphold equality and freedom without discrimination to anybody and to defend our countries interests
now i kinda understand why our clients located in the us mostly in cali act react differently every time topic goes to their living sometimes they vent also in a way when it comes to the billings expenses i thought that only our country the phil is doomed but yours too so sad
were cooked
still my question is who is running the country
things have only gotten worse under biden and nancy is a roadblock that prevents trump from having more accomplishments in getting things done nancy spent more time with threats of impeachment and road blocking trump than anything else does she even work for the people anymore or just herself and her vendettas against trump her and biden should both be assessed for competency
still as senile as he might have soundedhis answers were more conscientiouis each time than the scandalous remarks made against each argumenteach remark remained selfserving and scandalous without any supporting factsi remain scared that so many are willing to take in any part of data provided by simply put out any scandalous announcements providedyes i am still scared
2507 i thought he was going to say i had the highest iq
the first minute of this debate is where the secret service should have run in and surrounded the president and issued a threat warning and that they are taking the president to safetythey may have been exposed but it would have been netter for him to try and slide at least one more lie past the peoplethank god this ride is almost over i was gonna be sick if this continues
biden keep opening his mouth trump keep taking the lead
joe biden can barely complete a sentence anyone that votes for this is against america the the the the thats all you hear from biden
i love all people who are vetted legally into our existence
2853min biden i think i know you
even though trump was quite more enthusiastic
im doing the idea drinking game with my favorite coffee dark choclolate and cinnamon drink oh gee i gotta go weeeeeeeeeeeeee
i think joe biden gave nice responses
biden thank you next person please
biden im zionest trump no im zionest more than u you are bad palestinian xd
go biden voting trump could rot in jail
bro we are cooked
lets get an interview with robert f kennedy jr wsj
biden really said skibi
as an iranian watching from iran this show was so entertaining and hilarious trump should be in jail and biden should be in elderly care center
i am going to say well done to trump biden is ill and why i say well done to trump is because he kept his cool and didnt say to biden what f are you talking about
lets be realistic this man is over eighty years old and still debates and argues when my grandfather was his age he couldnt even remember his own name give this man some credit moreover the position hes vying for doesnt require any rational or cognitive level he is indeed one of the most suitable people for this job if i were eligible to vote i would definitely vote for this man
im a life long democratand ill be voting trump he absolite wiped the floor with bidone
biden is the most incompetent president of the us sick man needs to rest
and us as europeans and seeing this debate just to say one thing can we live our lifes in peace far away from the hands of washington for the pity sake we have enough troubles with brussels fake gov and inmigration issues besides a war in our continent to put up with terrorism destroying nord stream 1 and nuke threat because the nato warmongering against rfwe just want to live in peace leave us alone on our own plz
have to say i think there are a bunch of losers in this debate biden is the biggest loser trump is maybe third i guess some will say he won because he did so much better than biden but compared to past presidential debates just a few decades ago he wouldnt have won but the second biggest loser is america i think you can walk down just about any street in america and find a better person to be president than either of them even if trump is clearly better than biden in this debate the only real winner of this thing appears to be cnn maybe not perfect but they did seem to do okay and the fact that this is on youtube with the comments enabled i think is great kind of shocks me cause of everyone involved with this they are the only ones that i view significantly better than i did before this debate and my expectation was that they were going to screw something up by interrupting candidates continually and trying to do fact checks that ended up being incorrect only times they seemed to interrupt was when time was up and they treated both candidates the same
according to biden black colleges dont have money to build lavatories this debate is a joke lets go brandon
the idea that
155 theres no studio audience tonight yet mr biden waved to no one
i can not believe these are the only 2 people up for elections america needs a fresh youngster who cares for the people of america
i love the music at the beginning
the only scam and grift that i see going on in america is trump and the trump organization trying to take down a country that is actually succeeded to be the number one country on the planet and after his presidency every single other country on this planet saints were a joke not because of biden but because of this full
why does the debater refer to former president trump as president trump 2242
commonbiden was not mumbling thats a morse codes
bidenmumbling the ideathe idea that trump looking like hes holding laughter
im at time stamp 3114 trump plz answer the question
biden keep saying there is more to be done there is more to be done you had all these years to get things done where were you it is all bluff so sad what our country is turning into full of crimes and full of corruption
let putin be a us president he would shut down both of them without saying that they are dumb
biden looks like at any moment hes gonna wake up inside that cart in the intro of skyrim
fiftyone years do you hear this a major reason we have been shifted into indoctrination when we kill innocent life without their experiencing this dimension we fk ourselves wake up people
so we have to choose between a sharp liar and someone who is too old to remember his lie what a time to be alive
from all these comments i cant find anyone supporting biden trump will win
biden is mumbling but trump is an incoherent liar who managed to lie 100 of the time nothing he said was the truth i fact checked trump myself
aww they give biden handicap rules for the debate how cute
trump had h2o where did it go two bobos not interested
i am down on joe biden blue democrat forever
oh you mean it was a democrat that put razor wire across the rio grande and caused the death of women actually pregnant with children know that would be the gop you mean the democratic republic started the first civil war know that would be the gop you need to tell me that this country of america is falling into disarray chaos in a third world status because of the democratic republic know that would be the gop do you mean all the lies that are being told all the propaganda thats being spread is being done by the democratic republic ferret know that would be the gop
when you end the life of a baby you end the change of our ever living in a universe that our true creator designed
joe biden unironically speaks like president jimble but with more age in his voice
did you see on the news yesterday that 500 million went to a solar company they donated millions of it back to the biden administration thieves
i legitimately appreciate wsj for leaving the comments open it was a brave move but necessary to keep their integrity theyre doing better than the white house youtube channel just saying
how about were only giving ukraine weapons now not just money at this point meaning 3 years later they finally figured out in a war weapons are needed and cash is easily stolen and biden literally admitted he just handed out cash for most of the war
this should have been aired on tubi biden lips were moving but he wasnt saying anything
plz one debate for palastine and israel conflict
the comment section makes more sense than this debate
if someone says that his country is worse than other countries or that is the worst country this leads to fascismracism intolerance this is a main rule in the politics science now if these things are said from a president or a presidential nominee then america you are in serious trouble
why is no one talking about rfk jr he wouldve beat both of these guys in a debate and he actually cares about our country
can anyone else hear bidens ear piece
2355 infest the rats nest
no one has respected america for a long time its almost a third world country at this point
after this i am just scared
if biden doesnt know anyone who thought the economy was the best it has been during the years trump was in office then he doesnt remember any conversations he has had with anyone outside of his own administration for almost 4 years
my pc is restarting pc 1200
check out the real debate had all of the voices and much more substance google will bring you to it
someone get olivia pope in here only she can save biden at this point
this it it
im getting dumber by the minute watching this
biden son involved in a huge corruption cases
its good to hear the truth again thank you jesus for donald trump
during biden tenure human rights garaph of america gone down
there is no studio audience biden waves at empty audience
752 what did some companies say by the time you talked to a walmart manager about the jobs

biden do you know what is human rights thousands of children and wamen killed by israelu r arming israel yyyy
i come from a working class household in scranton pennsylvania where the kitchen table things werent able to be met during the month it was a problem
i cant even listen to this one sided conversation the only person speaking is king trump
biden is horrible
compared to mr biden mr trump is a powerhouse
who came here just to read and laugh a lot of the comments ps im a foreigner and citizen and i have always love this country but this debate hilarious
biden reminds me if that scene from the sopranos the quote by uncle junior he couldnt sell it hes just not respected he just couldnt sell it they dont respect him
how do you lose a debate to anyone whose not telling the truth
2600 2606 did biden say burn pits or burnt pi im not sure the stenographer got it right
trump should have just gone in and repeatedly said im sorry i didnt understand a thing that he just said can someone please clarify
joe biden criticize former president of us donal trump donald trump make the us best again
trump will save the usa again trump
i cant wait for the south park recap entirely fictional
10043 did i really say that joes faces haha
as a euro i am sorry americans you guys deserve better
i thought president biden debated well some of the media out there depicts him as cognitively challenged i didnt see that here
and biden opens with a lie it took him the first 10 seconds before a lie fell out of his mouth
1000000 tax credit to buy a home for black people what about the rest how about just don t give anything anything to any one in the end it is us taxpayers paying the bill
at last the cheap fakes debunked
is biden eyes turning black when he talks at times
how is that man president he cant even speak
if it wouldnt be so serious this would be mad funny d
trump won this
can we get a translator for biden i dont understand what hes saying at all
biden is full of bs prices are high as ever on every item we buy trump 24
245 dana bash is a fan of djt
i was waiting for a nurse to change biden diaper at some point
jeezwhat a shame
prior to the pandemic the us economy was the best in 20 years the democrats shut everything down to ruin trumps economy the majority of americans do not believe nor accept the lefts shutting down our country biden has destroyed our economy inflation is up 60 we can speak about crime and gun violence how about illegals biden must be removed
one good point biden makes agaisnt trump is trump looks out for the wealthiest i just want them all to do their jobs that no one has done since the 20s
the way biden looks so shocked when he looks at trump tho
2134 biden face after the burn
like if you vote for trump
march 1933 the enabling act becomes law in germany giving the chief executive power enforce his own laws without checks and balances the passing of the act marked the formal transition from democratic republic to totalitarian dictatorship 6 months later it was a 1 party state
why whisper biden its a debate
there has to be other candidates they are trying to play us the government has gone to far
omg its scary that biden has his fingers on the nuclear trigger
mr trump face is priceless
dude screw abortion yall cant even afford it that is not our top problems
i guess biden didnt tell enough lie be like trump do not answer any tough questions and just lie the rest of the way
if the november 2024 presidential election could speak heres what i think it would say to the american people this is your last chance after this there is no turning back you take the blue pill brandon the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe you take the red pill maga you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes remember all im offering is the truth nothing more
on the topic on january 6th my job at google was to remove evidence donald trump was innocentwhen i found out thats what i was removing i quitproof of election fraud by biden campaign my job was to remove iti quit my job because of thatwhat biden is saying on this topic is an absolute lie and id be happy to testify to any court on the topic
whats considered to be a black job
free palestina free palestina
the music at the beginning reminded me of super smash bros
when they talk about child healthcare in which they dont they decide to argue about stuff they act childish
very embarrassing for our current president
11626 yall please tell me you hear biden shing his pants like listen closely
4654 another lie from biden
biden starting world war three 100 correct biden failed destroying country 100 correct by donald trump
i love how trump says billion b illienn
all these ai president videos make me forget that these people are actually real
but whos gonna fight cornpop
americans dont you have a better candidate than these 2
trump completely annihilated creepy uncle joe
joe biden hands down is the worst president ive ever seen in my life he will destroy our country if he is president again
2 worst presidents of the historythey are just exposing each other please americans shose a fresh new president never go back to an ex an ex is an ex for a reason where are the other candidates shose a president who take care of american people greetings from europe
this is crazy dudes drifting into another planet
trump is the best president we could ever have he will make america great again
what in the f is this biden guy saying half the time its slurred garbage
wagnerleonard i m an american and a foreigner this is entertainment goldthe old fool looks so ridiculouly angry funnybuthe is dangeroushe outlined a plan for a socialist economy
all biden says us youre lying tries to say hes competent and veers off rambling the man is a train wreck
10807 is biden cryin
i would pay big cheddar to see these two duke it out in the octagon
this debate was an utter trainwreck how americans chose these two to be the top representatives of the country is beyond me
smdhi just dont understand why the people in america voted for biden
absolutely nothing wrong with cognitive faculties of either candidate essentially the one blaming the other the real issue is truth and moral values fact checking urgently needed
those bug eyes
biden bama plotted against trump all charges false trump for 2024 america first
they forgot to mention the part where they traded a gay basketball player for a us soldier and one of those countries also joe biden did that
biden gives a bad name to pennsylvanians
theres no gen z in america apart from ancestors
nowim 100 sure america is falling apart
you dont have a younger candidate
walking corpse
polls have not changed in fact biden won amongst independent likely voters in the midwest so all this fox news hysteria making putin happy stop it and read the important polls
you are fired
america is stopping 3rd war by stopping russia have you not heard north korea controlled by russia declared war against america
the moment he walked out on stage he lost the presidency come back here in november and like this
listening to biden is like trying to understand someone new to the english language
biden is just not making any good points especially the iraq war biden may have brought the army home but he left all the equipment we the american people paid for and that gave terrorist more means to cause terror
this is so hard to watch
old people arguing about their handicap and golfing skills
biden has much more information and great solutions for americahe tried to say in the time limit thats why he paused a little whats this fuss america politics became as low as korea
matthew 521 you have heard that it was said to men of old you shall not kill and whoever kills shall be liable to judgement
joe performed at his best again
both of them are expired
an honest man never has to remember what he has said that is why biden had to memorize every line and talking point and use every ounce of wit to merely keep on the defensive trump seemed to give a good performance but was under almost no pressure you couldnt have handed an easier win on a silver plate than cnn did
the sensors dont even know what byedin is sayin
lets talk about the petrodollar
why is no body talking about the manchurian candidate 11610
biden has embarrassed the usa on the world stage for 4 years
we send love letterssmh plz let joe stay home its just sad now to see him and hes our president
biden talkie about crimes in afghanistan as if he didnt deny seas fire in palestine
the only thing the only thing biden has done was go in absolutely undo everything trump is dead other than that biden really hasnt done much
lets get ready to mumble
lets be real trump got them on the thing that he hasnt changed the one thing that brings in too much money the tariff but lets be honest if biden was going to change anything you would have already been done the dude doesnt even speak to the country he cant even talk he cant even talk on his show hes terrible hes gone should not even still be in government if anybody has anything to do or change it would be trump trump has to prove itself and trumps two prideful to not do things everybody was against building the wall but everybody wants to say what happened to the wall he fried everybody wanted to build a wall before him and then got against it when he came in office you cant do things with everyone is against you so i agree trump needs to get in fire everyone is not on his side with the wall position then cuz you got to have people that are against you but positively but trump has something to prove and he has to show you that does something so if trump gets in the presidency and nothing happens that just means no president will ever do anything for us
sooo the only thing biden did was lower the cost of diabetes medication trump 2025 all the way
no more biden biden is a war criminal starting world war three our tax money gone to war people have no food to eat
this was painful to watch
i bet the biden family got paid when they left all the military supplies and weapons
this is just two grandpas debating
im watching this for entertainment is this supposed to be taken seriously
who uses the word winer in a debate biden
very painful to watch this its a disgrace that cnn orchestrated this so call debate what a shame
one lied the other told the truth
bro i could not take this debate seriously i watched the whole thing and biden was mumbling the whole time answering different questions 12313 bidens face when trump started talking about golf i cant with this
i wouldnt be surprised if the actor that plays crooked joe is on trumps side and this whole debate is just an excellent piece of acting of these two gentlemen i believe the real biden is not among us anymore the one were looking at now is an actor and hes doing a phenomenal job trump has the whole thing under control
bro the usa is cooked
we need sir rahul gandhi and modi ji face off debate too
trump wins2024
trump is right once inflation takes hold we are doomed
biden the worst president made everything worse no more biden no more biden no more biden
connor roy for president
for this we will have a rexession
trump said stupid enough are smart enough because the whole america us treating black with opression
more oil spills were overlooked while trump was in office im not about that f i x it trump
unemployment withheld my unemployment for no reason this is not america this is mexico and china
one world government one world one world currency new world order
as a veteran biden has done nothing for us trump never said veterans were suckers and losers one 4 star said he heard it but no one else around heard it that 4 star doesnt like trump and never did i served more years that bou my husband is retired military biden doesnt care at all biden only cares for his precious bou and hunter the same hunter that got kicked out of the military for drug use
honestly not sure whos worse
whats the vegas odds biden will live to the end of another 4 years
2934 joe biden says somebody better get him and 2 shadows walk across the screen demon activity
key notes since trumps tax break the debt increased to how much since the implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017 the national debt has increased significantly during trumps presidency the gross national debt grew by approximately 78 trillion from nearly 20 trillion when he took office to almost 278 trillion by the time he left
i cant believe the whiny liberals even let a convicted felon debate against what people call the current president
if you put an ice cube in a cup of water what will happen when the ice melt is some more water in the glass well now it will be the same see level rising 10022
and us normal people dont blame trump for covid we arent dumb okay had biden not mandated vaccines that caused people to quit or get fired from their jobs some people left their dream career because they didnt want to take the vaccine bidens fault
the point here is not even how much you dont like trump as a candidate but the fact that biden is no longer fit to be president
the fact of the matter biden is a joke
both are shameful choice for president
the idea how many times did biden say that i can see through all his lies
this debate is more fun to watch than any other movie
biden saying trump is the worst president using the internet as reference like ok everything is true here
am not even american but i think from this debate joe cuts across as someone who lacks accountability and trump is seemingly the business man here joe doesnt want to maintain eye contact and drifts off point making bogus accusations which leaves trump on the defence as far we know globally trumps policies embraced a peaceful stance and joes current tenure is more about ukraine and more wars i kind of relate with trumps concern that the american geopolitics has become a sham even as joe sounds delusional when he said nobody wants to mess with america in reality the world is getting frustrated with america than ever before even as the american dollar is poised to crumble i think its time for joe to retire from active service i think hes simply running because the party doesnt have a better replacement that can upset trumps campaign even while knowing the odds he would just tell himself that at least he did try after all hes got nothing lose but american economy will suffer a shock very soon
mike obama cant be any better
i always say a businessman is smarter than a politician
2251 whats quidpro joe crossing out on his podium cnn comes to joes rescue by ending his time early by saying thank you mr president when the puppet loses his place then we see him crossing out that last answer before the wide angled camera is shut down thats why theres no live audience
its simple biden is the gay mans persons president trump is the heterosexual mans persons president its that simple so who are you
so who won this debate comment below
they go to war all around the world and they cant go to war defending the border that doesnt make sense to me
mr biden i am sorry your voice is not clear for me
dont worry sleepy joe you are going to still have insurance that we usa citizens pay for every time working citizens get paid unless the 18 million immigrants that you let in take those funds we pay for their children to be delivered in our hospitals thats coming from a registered nurse that works every day i cant afford to have a child but these immigrants get free room and board paid in full only in joe biden america
biden the best the dems can come up with
all i know is if trump wins this election everyones criminal record needs to be cleared even this deceased because they were cheated too
cnn she said thankyou after she hears something she dont want to hear donald talks about secrets she said thankyou cnn ur so fake ur only trying to make him look bad
why didnt joe do all those things he said he could do when he and his partner in crime had the whitehouse and the country in their stranglehold for eight long insufferable years ha all those weeks of practicing his prepared answers and having his answers written out in jumbo print on his podium was a waste of timejust like his fake presidency
trump won this my family in new jersey and where i now live in houston tx we all voting for trump we dont want a weak leader we have 2 wars and we dont have time to have a weak minded leader and we want gas under 2 dollars a gallon again we have more natural gas in the usa than anywhere in the world we need to drill and help our people first and help our kids again and get them strong minded not weak amen
and you grew up where
what about those files you had in your garage joe biden i heard no more about that
is those two are the best american to be a president
bye joe we dont need youre so called politics you are for foreign and not america american citizens at that trump is the better president
robert byrd whats friends with joe biden
god bless you mr trump
well lets have a look at what mr trump was left with when he was elected too then ah
biden doesnt even know what hes sayinghes a very poor leaderhell put the country very badlytrump is very right hes better than all the presidenthes concern for the security and safety of the country
america can be defined in a single word what is it
i get dementia by just hearing him talk
the roast of joe biden
the debate was entertaining
what is jo looking at his prepared answers perhaps the first presidential debate where the american people arent in the audience and arent allowed to debate it where comments are turned off
the biden regime has screwed the us that hard that even cnn are looking to bring trump back
cnn is holding the debate how appropriate the fake president of 2020 best friends quid pro china joe rambles off the answers that hes practiced for the past month he was in sequestration cnn appropriately has no live audience who was joe waving to
trump is the best
the idea thats a lie we find ourselves in a situation like dude come on
i am democrat but trump won i really think that trump has evolved as a politician
so why are we the average poor not being paid a living wage with multiple jobs americans being taxed more than the people and companies that have enough to get taxed how come they dont tell us about the juggling of laws and rights in the many different fictional jurisdictions of the state and federal government oh thats right because thats how theyve done it they just pass the problems back and forth like insurance companiesoh thats a matter of the state not the federal and vise versa we wonder how the rich do it and its something to do with the many benefits of setting up specialized trusts that basically let them get out of being taxed
yo its comedy central
i wish cnn would reveal why rfk jr wasnt allowed to the debate in atlanta we the people should be allowed to hear all the major candidatesa constitutional democracy works best when we have more choices
what about the civilians you left behind biden
everyone can argue points for an against either candidate the net sum of the day and the last 35 years is americans are worse off in almost every aspect every single american maybe with the exception of those who are under full government sponsored aid who havent a clue whats really going on but the entire world is more unstable and the american government is the weakest its been in many decades we are very vulnerable
firm believer this man should never been president
biden knows what hes doing and what his party is doing he cant deny it nothing look at that guilty face its a shame
trump looks mad he didnt even greet the moderators biden doesnt sound healthy at all its concerning i am not sure at this point
honestly its frankly kinda scary that the big media alone managed to hide that the presidente was pretty much senile for that long i know i know most people kinda had an idea but i dont think anyone was prepared for it to be this bad if they can hide such a monstrous fact in plain sight i worry about the things that arent as obvious
he cant defeat me if he cant understand me boe jiden the art of democrats
bai den you killing people for last 14 years
who was joe waving to when he walked on there was no audiences he sounded like he was greeting a crowd trump just walked on
it really looks like biden is reading a teleprompter
trump biden ablablablaahhhhhh whats my name
jan 6th that was all pelosi acrion she caused it and their huding it but of course cnn is in pelosi side pelosi is a liaf she did it all she turned soldiers down embarrassing
15000 new jobs only wow is america bankrupt already
i wished they asked about colleges
unsteady biden subdued trump
704 truth is he is the only president this decade
biden support everyone else but the us trump support the us and have everyone else pay the us back
i thought biden wasnt doing as bad as has been said until the closing remarks
interviewer thank you biden and by the way
i dont want to watch this from cnn their so biased it wants to make me throw up they just minpulate everything
chat am i cooked
this debate is edited this is not the full debate
biden is the biggest liar even u can see it in his face
he called in president trump at 12003
why does it cut so abruptly at the end
trump showed up with so much aura
yall are the ones w immigrants being here the republican party
biden the idea of number onealllh bhyu hkkstua trump i do not understand what hes talking about i guess he does not understand either
there tons of evidence of election fraud
4607 in i laughed out loud at this one morals of an alley cat
senator byrd was your best buddy joe a known supporter of the kkk you spoke at his wake
do you base politics off of someones lifestyle my lifestyle for instance
well theyve made it where you cant support or vote trump or youll be arrested so it does seem like hes speaking the truth
if everyone is worried about trump becoming a dictatorthen why doesnt biden do it now
trump is a bully theres nothing behind him but as every bully hes funny and good at talking biden instead is the one that should win the elections but he wont because his health doesnt support him anymore thats it as a european i think trump would make a better foreign affair politic but if i was an american id never vote for trump
biden still owes trump an apology for telling him to shut up on national television at their first debate back in 2020 and my 6 yr old daughter at the time said that even she knows what respect is for our president
russia has 4 military warships in cuba 1 is a nuclear submarine russia doesnt care about fighting us biden has made us weak private gun ownership is the only thing russia fears
support for trump from italy
someone please tell me why joe biden eyes are brown back then his yes where blue
biden looking like who put this tie in me
cooper and megan kelly are better journalists the journalists here are like biden they made the thing a little boring
you guys need some new president candidates holy lol best regards a guy from denmark
bidenyou left 85billon dollars in military equipment to be used against us
we need mr trump back in the white house office
o hope trumps win but in reality ppl dont care anymore when you have just a group of ppl controlling us and no one wants to have no more babys the way this world is going
how can a criminal be americas president all indictments found guilty so many ppl died from covid and trump did nothing cmon guys wake up
another comment that was made on a summarytake on the debate in relation to p biden they did not have a comment section i believe it was from the governor of a large west coast state who said basically what party ends their support of a candidate after one poor performance debate to which i say to him and numerous other pundits who act like this debate was this presidents first misstepwhere have you been the last year he has been misstepping all over the place for months have you been asleep
i financially had no issues when trump was in an now i can barely pay my bills im going to vote who allows me to afford to live
t appeals to all religious fanatics for a reason he knows theyre also fanatics
when will we have peace on earth thats my question
america need a younger president time to stop old politics and start the new better ideas for the country
ive seen the poll numbers if biden wins i would have serious questions trump is way too high in the polls but we seriously need to vote biden out enough is enough im so sick of his lies doesnt matter what you think of trump biden is a disaster
hes 65 and only 220 pounds
trump is saying things that biden never thought he would so biden ends up saying too little using too many words
it was easy for him to say its a classic case of jbi joe blew it made himself look like a right idiot
china jo is clueless
biden called our troops stupid bastards
come on try getting it out try getting it out i dont know if youre gonna put this on tv
so again and im a white guy and im left out im struggling
4617 watch the body language
biden doesnt even know how to follow along what trump says
likr him or not trump is america last chance and hope
and groceries almost doubled did not go up 20 dollars he is crazy trump 2024 please help fix our economy so we can actually live

joe biden is a huge joke to this nation its very sad his family should be charged with elder abuse
can someone wake up biden and tell trump to quit mewing
seriously joe most americans would agree trimp was a great president and joe is worst just stop with the lies joe just stop
it is now this exact momentwhen i realized that we need new blood all the way around all this is just bad and appears to be a fake to me its all a farce it looks like to me absolutely ridiculous we need to get away from this stupid middle school fighting and fix and work on actual issues that are not made up and fake lets talk about fixing the interest rate lets talk about immigration issues that will fix the problem lets talk about a path to citizenship for illegals and lets talk about the slavery now in america rather than talk about the slavery that happened 30 years ago that both parties especially the democrats took part in lets live in the here and now and not in the past come on guys trump you are better than this biden i know is doing his best and it isnt great but america needs much much better than both of them come on guyscan anyone see this trashy display we need better
joe is right corporate greed and price gauguin is the culprit thats driving inflation joe is not the ones who is demanding the poor people to remain in servitude by sucking every penny out of their pockets
they mixed up the drugs they accidentally gave biden the fentanyl instead of the adderall
joe dont be so emotional no one fears or respect america anymore and how does the worst president only accept 1 payment per year trump needs to speak on that
my retribution will be success donald j trump
what a bunch of lies biden
hahaha wow we are going anywhere with these two
belarus is not apart of nato they aided russia in the invasion of ukraine joe doesnt know what hes talking about
omg i have the same birthday as joe biden
mr biden its time to go you are unfit to be president
its the only thing biden does hes a threat to the usa i bet you cry when you lose while the rest are parting we know of biden wins we know longer are americans we arent even free but we all knows he will because trumps the stronger choice and does what he says
he just said the reason why all these illegal immigrants are coming in to our country
american democracy what is that america is a republic
rfk jr roasted them both during his debate oh my word was it refreshing to watch
im shocked america has only these two as candidates are there no young capable intellectual empathetic leaders in the whole country
no president has ever destroyed the country like biden
if u rewatch the whole video disregarding few pauses biden done well just have low energy
thats what i love about you and always add to your campaign its because youre strong minded when he talks its slow and what the
he said trump did nothing when iran attackedwell under biden us troops were attacked over 150 times by iran and their proxies
new favorite talking narcotics it went down for awhile are you saying since you became president it has gone up biden
president trump truth the vegetable 100 lies
jan 6th was not done by trump that was the fbi inciting jan 6th
trump was good and much better than biden but he doesnt want to change the subject
i feel the most difficult thing for these two was answering the question that was ask
i still dont understand what joe is talking about
gonna stop corporate greed right after the next campaign contribution joe is the worst thing that ever happened to scranton
wow cnn hasnt hidden this yetsomeones slipping
sleepy brandon got destroyed
what nation are you working for this is usa
the border patrol did no support biden that was a lie
heres the truth i noticed today that dow jones index has surpassed the 39000 point mark and nasdaq composite index is approaching 18000 points which had never happened before my money investment has kept going up and up roughly about 20 im doing nothing except watching my money growing i am quite happy due to having extra money to remodel my bathroom and buying things i want whatever the current administration is doing is working and its in fact working well omg i cannot believe i just said that well theres nothing wrong with telling the truth folks
you stole now put your hands out on each side with the peace sign saying you stole
they kill mehow they sell this black narrative come election time yetblack people cant be anything more than 14th amendment citizens so called black people need to leave this democracy alone and push for the constitutional republic which these criminals have stolen
people on fentanyl arent gonna say they do it so how do you actually fix it
while india watching at the corner
only communism and dictatorship talked like joe bidenit shows joe biden doesnt value the supreme court doesnt understands the different commonsense and the good heart to bring and create peace within america united states of america
im not a sex offender like you were saying trump do you think there getting reimbursed for what your campaign has been spending no your not let nico micholetti know that keep serving the people food
my groceries bill doubled still after leaving some things out of the list
trump is right america is ridiculous honest opinion from balkans for the last few years
they always talk about the veterans but nobody in the government do something about it ive been a lot of those guys asking food
inspite of bidens worse performance every american should vote for him as trump is proved sexually criminal by the court over and above trump supports a secluded foreign police which will loose the image of united states
biden speaks the idea america the idea that youre actually president
everyone wants to get you to leave the thing i read said you biden was the absolute worse
how many lies did have to make up with your campaign
trump get it right im not a sex offender you can keep lying all you want
mr biden america is behind you wƒì dont want trump no third world
everything trump says is true
thats my uncle
its because of you put our own people up why do people from other countries think they can come with no money and they can sleep on the side of the road not our own is the worst thing you could do then you ruined the wall
wheres tony marry
south park in real life were doomed
whats the cover up
they just said americas said that under trump things were more affordable and not under biden they have doubled in cost then biden says look what i was left with umm under trump it was better which majority of americans say so obviously trump left with us in good standing and biden ruined it
love you trump hope you can make american great again
trump destroyed him in this debate
take a shot for every time you hear thats not true
okayyy joe the idea of tsu is still 2 billion is still not paid is still a fact

how many times does biden say this is a lie or simply not truemakes me believe some of it did happen its crazy the amount of times its said
the duo responded to questions with a lot of humility
im gonna have to watch this somehwre else on a tv or something i cant watch this on my phone i can barely hear president biden speak im in bed sleeping maybe it will help me fall back asleep tho
biden doesnt know what hes even saying
post debate jake tapper had the best idea ive heard yet to quell the furore between the replacebidenontheticket and the keepbidenontheticket factions hold one or more press conferences where he takes unscripted questions from reporters it will instantly demonstrate his mental acuity and command over the topics that matter to voters not to mention restore the voters flagging confidence in him immediately my view is that if biden is asking for my vote then i as a voter have a right to know this about him by the same token if he hides from voters behind his aides then please stop asking for my vote fair request right
trump estados unidos tambien habla espa√±ol
enought of china jo
is there anyone else who just became legal to vote this election who feels that were all just doomed
trump ya cumpliste con tu capricho de un rico de ser presidente da paso a la nueva generacion
los latinos somos cheaters trump y tu cuantos millones has desfalcado en nueva york eso no es cheating
hear me on this this is not a rally for your high school football team this is a choice for the man who will run the most powerful nuclear country in the world your vote will determine that and you have to make the right choice for the best person for that office for our country not just because its your political party we need a leader who is alert and cognitive the sad thing is that the democratic party has no one else to run for president i wonder why pappy
did you see biden fiddle with his right ear ear piece is bothering him
biden has a brand new word idea
im not rich but when trump was in i was not suffering and it was covid times as well
no negemos lo innegable estados unidos tambien habla espa√±ol
come on america i dont think biden is the guy yall are trusting with your lives the man lost his own context mid sentence multiple times as always
biden was dozing off for a minute
and i still say this who would still vote for biden he doesnt make any sense when he speaks and i thought w bush was out of it
wow99 of the time biden was incoherent i cant believe jillor the democratic party for allowing this man to be in office this longthink of itwe are on the verge of bankruptcy and nuclear warand we can thank the democratic party
comment of a german us became a subject of laughter when trump started his very presidentship
biden loves gaslighting americans do your own research facts dont care feelings curiosity question why couldnt we get trump vs robert kennedy
funny how the people announcing things at the start were more professional than the president and former president they did absolutely nothing nothing was accomplished neither should be in office
this is the best thing comedy central ever posted
this is bad
pov you do not live in america and find this entertainment
we arent facing inflation were living it joe
trump is right if they continue this way america will be 3rd world look at south africa you will have a comunist country run by criminals stealing all the money
biden is the reason we dont take anything americans say seriously
so these are the two people running for president americans foreigners north korea
this is inhumane
downfall of united states here we go
biden family obama family clinton family all lie and are no use for our country we the people love trump honest man

glad biden was able to reduce his handicap while being vp
by by biden hello trump thank god
im not even american and i dont need to watch the whole 1 and a half hour thing to know that trump is wining the electionslike just look at them
it is like listening to standup comedy when biden speaks so unreal to think that this grandpa from a nursing home is president of the most powerful country in the world
i think hillary clinton had more chance than joe biden
brondon where you at
cheaters never prosper this was so rigged to help biden and backfired perfectly gotta love it and ya nice try with those weak cheats trying to help biden when he stumbles tell him thank you real fast move on ect ect its easy to see in this video the bad thing most americans probably missed most of it but if you missed it look for jump cuts and the hosts thanks you and quickly moving on ect proving it was rigged to help biden but the best part as we all know there was no saving him from himself
it was a bad night for biden but i still love the integrity of biden both candidates are not fit for such a great nation age and dishonest kk
jesus is king
doing this in a gymnasium would have saved 2 million
trump 2024 were tired of the dementia puppet
were not a failing country joe you are the failure
for one hour 20 minutes thes men are extra ordinary at their age many of us wont be able to stand for 10min at this age give it to them

pair of liars probably i say this though in light of what you seen here could you say with 100 conviction that biden is running the country thats a massive elephant in the room
black jobs huh what is a black job that statement is triggering to me
lowkey i feel bad for biden tho hes clearly a tired puppet
3250 this old men lost his mind
biden completely unable to operate even one sentence on his own cheating on live tv with reading on a screen telling him what to say amd a earpiece he rwaches for unbelievable shock to the public and all countries watching around the world trump standing tall amd speaking on his own
why the americans give lot of loans to pakistan
you have 350 mio inhabitants and these two are your best leaders usa is game over
im here on the 5th of july 2024 biden always walks like a robot with zombie moves the old man should be home receiving home care
rabble rabble bidenomics part of the what
amazing performance by trump trumps shocking and horrified with his double turning of head look in dismayed of joes confused blubbered state
a puppet being a joker at the hands of someone in disguise shouldnt be projected again

manchurian candidate
i think the nursesing home is missing a patient
we who were the only the largest pollution in the world said biden

how embarrassing
10753 thank you president biden president trump lol
take a shot every time biden says the idea
we finally beat medicare
biden is old guys please bear with him number 1 number 2 his smile is so addictive
did he call biden brandon about endorsement y of border patrol
i watched every minute that sedious act to our capital he watched it on tv for 3 hours before he finally told his people friends to go home he said we love you to these people who killed guardsmen who tried to protect our senate the transfer of power
please stop bullying president biden
id like to ask veterans to confirm or deny bidens claims are veterans better off with biden
1149 yes i think elder care is really important he should be taken care of
my prediction is the democrats within 3 months of joe biden being reelected if he is will themselves deem him unfit for office and let kamala harris take the office
ufc should set a match for them
why did obama throw bin laden out the plane
by the way tarrifs are paid by the people tarrifs raise prices
i am the witness of 2 old men
biden looks too oldcmon guyshe barely speaks
you would just hand over ukraine to russia you tried to stop payments to ukraine unless the found diet in bide frump is a kiar a traitor liver if russia
well at least trump try keep his compose to a minimum responses and biden did not fall asleep on his debate still no to both
putin invaded the criemea ukraine before biden ws president trump allowed this when he was president
why would any american vote for biden again this is insane
trump never just answers a questiongood grief he answers things that havent been asked yethe talks in circlestrump said biden wants to take the baby in the 9th monthhe lie like a rug
trumps lies are astounding i have video when he said those horrible words against our vets
lots of intelligent funny comments here i struggle in amazement at the elder abuse of our current president i am not a fan of most of his political stances but i will always be for respecting the highest office in our great country pure simple imo p biden is being has been used to facilitate influence and control in our government he is seldom if ever completely lucid he should have an advocatepreferably a family member ding ding wife who says thats enough like a least a year ago at least his presidential legacy could have been in part one that ended early but with dignity it is painful to watch his continued diminishing state on stage for all the world to see it is like watching an episode of the twilight zone when realizing he is the president of the united states of america is on display as he lives out his aging process under extreme pressure physically and emotionally shame on everyone who has continued to use this once vibrant human being in this way
you biden are the only so called president that didnt make sense or your mumbling when you cant remember what to say go trump
trump is trump but biden is unfit
maga directed by trump refused to pass a bipartisan law for the border immigration but he trump told them no so they did not pass the law why because he did not want biden to win
it is scary anyone believes a word biden says we are living through this biden administration we know
these cannot be the candidates to run the most progressive empire in the world
biden has to go now trump is what we need now im for trump always
its awful these are the only options for americans both are delulu tons of immigrants came from former soviet union countries highly educated people definitely not criminals but yes they were given handouts when previously immigrants had to work really hard they had free child care while im having to pay for it all and pay more than rent for 1 child they havent answered the single question just blah blah and wake up people understand that they are both on the same side they are both supported by same elite and then its all of us on another side never never i would have believe i would rather support anarchy than something like this this is absolutely awful and painful america has become a joke nothing is better than in other countries have you been to asia northern europe the only reason america is still standing is because of the very very hardworking americans despite the government not because of the government how sad btw i was not born in the us i came legally 12 years ago i was proud of american values and then so disappointed to see whats happening im hurting for the people and im hurting for the world because world depends on the us and depends on the dollar i cant believe as people we cannot do anything to stop this
gump never answers any of the questions hes asked and sleepy joe is to old to last another term neither of them deserve to be president they think that their golf game should determine how healthy they are omg really
vote for the lesser bad
man a biden vs trump debate in 2024 would really be something their styles and policies couldnt be more different just picture the sparks flying itd easily be one of the most anticipated debates in recent memory
dude biden cant even finish a sentence
mr trump said put bleach under your arm youll be alright
and these two are the ones who always shout democracies to the world yup your country is doomed
trump got rid of 1500 safe guards for you the people now railri can freight chemicals through towns if acciend occurs luke ine did the railroads are claiming no responsibility to clean up the mess they created
3356 when you realize you have 1hr left of debate this is elderly abuse for biden
its like listening to a drunk person after 55 shots of vodka
the man trump knows economics
america has fallen we in europe laugh at america now becaise of biden though him america is a joke
trump handled the country much better than anybody else would have during the pandemic there was world peace when trump was president just like trump mentioned in his debate russia would never have attacked ukraine and hamas israel if trump was in power trump wouldnt let it happen
i am terrified for nation poor leadership from both trump is disgusting he cares for no one but himself and dangerous to society he is not to be trusted people had better use wisdom
that is because trump has no leadership he is ready to pass the buck to the states he knows how to play golf he cheats at that too
biden performed so well and literally whooped orange man in every subject awesome job biden
2024 trump has my vote on 2 reasons border crisis inflation crisis
two grandpas exposing their dirty laundrys to the entire world what a shame to america the great country
trump is right inflation is killing us everything is way to expensive we were so much better off with trump
businessman is smarter than a politician
i am surprised that presidents talk about blacks hispanic and what not it has to be citizens only one word american they all are equal i just did not like that part
the idea is ok
all t you get with trump is chaos and lies
this proves there is no god
trump isa joke he left so mush damage and yet biden came in and brought america back
biden is old he doesnt even finishes a sentence without shattering
trump killed 100000 and more he killed americans because he was not a leader
bide was great he answered the question trump lied and lied
compared to most african leaders biden is still great
4606 im not on either side but why the heck is he giving this guy more time clear bias by cnn not that im surprised of course
all what i hear is that putin is a war criminal d i see only war criminals on western side european usa israhell the united states will go down it is gonna happen in this year i dont support the wat in ukraine at all peace could have established in april 2022 but the us and the uk didnt want it they wanted to continue the senseless war
right
biden whit face of where im i every debate so lol go trump make americas great again
its awesome
biden is a joke im ashamed of him
oh my goodness i cant believe these two bozos are our canidates they are sitting there arguing like children i am genuinely scared for our country
its true everything that comes out of that old mans mouth is a lie god god bless you mr trump
so why we still paying sub charges when going to doctor why we still paying for meds
biden starts a sentence and finishes the sentences he started 10 years ago
we call it migrant crimes but i call it biden migrant crime donald trump 2024 presidential debatei like this ma shame
with trump no body has ever seen heard done or been before with trump he is the first the only the most the best anyone has ever been before with trump he will always been incrediblewellat least he got that right im not giving him a second chance at making america great again he didnt finish the walla lot of money wasted that mexico never paid for and that is just one thing he didnt do that he said is causing americas downfall without all those immigrants his properties would have never been built ask him how many immigrant maids provided him services like changing the sheets after encounters with women like stormy daniels
bs the cost of groceries has went up way more that 20
i wish trump had a real opponent
biden we are quickly becoming a failing country record homelesnesssssssss leads to record crime
go trump
78 and 81 years old we can do better than this
i just want to say how terribly sad this is this is an elderly mans so many people are making fun of i blame his family and colleaguespresident biden health is failing and know body close to him will do the right thing i would never allow this if it was my dad
rip america 1776 2024
they should do another saturday night live of this debate
listening to biden hurts my head
im sorry but ive seen 90 year olds with fullblown dementia speak better than our president did you people really vote for him and are going to again i beg you for the sake of our country please dont
biden always talks about 15m jobs he created but they just gone during the pandemic as everywhere in the world no achievement
before the debate even started the moderator said that no notes would be allowed at around 36 minutes biden held up a pad of paper and folded over the page then at 38 minutes he once again held up the notepad you could notice all through the debate biden was looking down most of the time at his notes how come the notes were allowed by him
theyre just like children fighting they left the question and fight against whos the better president
joe biden has a gay administration
dear humans biden doesnt talk like this notice his speed loss of speed speed slower speed etc why because hes reiterating what he is hearing within his earpiece like a robot
why couldnt biden make his own case for trumps presidency he refers to unnamed experts that voted him the worst what am i supposed to do with that
red and blue have got to go what a shame
i think the last 3 minutes should be a face off on who has the best dad jokes i mean its already borderline comedy may as well give it a cherry
i love putin whole world love putin he is world leader
trump is very sharp as always biden appears to be lost in the air
trump ooh hes righthe beat medicarehe beat it to death best thing ive heard
the amount of time biden said the fact is dude you have been debunked that many times trump is right iam 39 from australia these few years biden in office have been the only time i felt australia was stronger then the usa
the only thing no one can debate is how much debt the us is in and how it is dispersed world wide by the dollar which is the reason countries are ditching the dollar and reclaiming their gold
look at this debate we need a age limitwe are in a world of trouble if we cant get anyone in there to fix this country we are doomed dont know if biden is capable to fixing it hes more into destroying our country trump maybe fix it but we are still in the process of losing our country we are in deep crisis
looks like joe biden going to bite the dust
biden cannot even say a sentence clearly and still wants to be president its pathetic
this is the most biased debate i have ever seen the moderator spends more time talking on behalf of biden than the participants
america you are stronger than some terrorist corrupting your society you guys have taught your ideas all over the world the entire world is america because america is an ideanot luxurious houses and cars you have a home all over the world not only in america love you brothers and sisters love from nepal immigration is a policy to liberate whole world you know the idea by living it
sorry america
biden is a liar
he number 1 number 2 by the way the idea do these guys not know how to articulate sentences they cant be speaking like that if this keeps going like this americans will start expecting to see whales with arms and legs and coming out of the ocean given the fact that everything mixes in in the us
lol no one wants to screw around with us thats why russian navy is in cuba and usa didnt even react everyone admire usa yeah sure were the embarrassment of the modern world
conservative media has been showing this hospice patient but state run media has been hiding his dementia
purge election year is coming 4th of july purge happy independence day lol
biden doesnt even know what he says himself he can barely talk it seems he cant breathe
at 2225 trump calls biden brandon i almost lost it
what makes 2024 looks like 1950s on the screen
wheres my student loan forgiveness biden that you promised
why want usa that other countries are afrait of them
biden this is a complete lie i am from portland oregon and i can tell you 1000 that the police force there has decimated so much that you can go an entire week without seeing them people are going 85 miles an hour upanddown i five because theres no police force anymore and that is because of you and the democratic party on the west coast was making it to where police if things go wrong they are guilty before innocent that was you that had nothing to do with trump
beware of trump idolatry stand for the truth and dont be biased jesus is lord
i live outside the us ie part of that world that he says respected us when he was president no they didnt and they will not respect us if he is reelected
impeach biden please
personality is one of the hardest things to change so past behavior is a refection of what theyll do trump will try to remove more of your rights remove social security remove medicaid and medicare and social security increase taxes for the poor while lowering for the rich and his buddies and their companies fraud against people taxes just like he did with the banks and loans for his real estate inheritance and sell out people and their money against other countries i dont know why trump isnt locked up for treason for supporting putin against ukraine and putin probably has some blackmail dirt on him and can no longer make an oath for the constitution as president in addition saying that he doesnt care about nato and the insurrection attempt on january 6th those supreme court justices down playing the crimes and trying to give him immunity shows their corruption and treason and need an investigation
those election 2920 is in wuestion
why is biden not impeached and he and his party not charged with treason theres something terribly broken in the system what about the oath they took they seem to ne anti american just my opinion proud to be a true american patriot
i cant believe they started debating who was better at golf theyre both a joke
as a brit looking on obviously age can get the better of anyone but biden as president of america is an embarrassment biden is only fit to be in an old peoples home eating soup with a fork sat in a rocking chair while singing the wheels on the bus go round round 820 836
as a brit looking on obviously age can get the better of anyone but biden as president of america is an embarrassment biden is only fit to be in an old peoples home eating soup with a fork sat in a rocking chair while singing the wheels on the bus go round round
most debate lets propose our best way to improve our country us presidential debate nah that dudes a liar he ruined it all
the strongest nation inbthe world is istael
not right now is not the best country
what a egos battle can anyone get us a real president america doesnt deserve it
if you keep biden as president then america is totally screwedhe is a rambling fool
biden cant get through a sentence to answer a question trump talks in circles and avoids questions god we are doomed
no to both need new to move forward
upsetting that rfk couldnt be in the debate
biden looks like hes learning things every time trump talks maybe we should have a debate every week until the election so that biden can learn how to run the country a little better till trump gets in
had to forward when biden was talking since i could not understand what he is saying he is sick and needs help this inidcates a group of people non elected has been ruling america since this man is sick trump is not good either but at least he is not sick
honestly i feel so bad for biden aside from his obvious disability he just doesnt have the rhetorical skills to match up with whatever trump was accusing him of im sure he had a good or at least a fair point answering all of these questions but it sometimes just landed as jfhdwiudhsufhs
score cards trump 810 biden 610
didnt believe one single word biden said well the words i could understand
cnn has very bad greenscreen greets from someone whos not american
were so cooked
trump wile rise again
why does snl have to be on a break we need jim carrey
rfk jr won this
bidens behavior made it flagrantly clear inarguably evident that he is suffering not from old age alone but from dementia
this is a freak show rip us
people dont understand job creators create taxpayers
whats messed up is if biden was up in the polls not one democrat would say anything about having him step down and let someone else run for president
12933 when the selection is over
biden dont even know where hes at
12353 funniest part of the whole debate
they should read the comments to see who is the worse president in history at least between these two
im from chicago and im 45 minutes nw and i wont step foot there
democracy is being destroy by the current president
we ahhhh beat medicare thank you president lol
how many times biden said the idea
trump was the worst during his term and then bidden came now trump is the second worst and bidden dethroned him
trump one lie after another how do you know when trump is lying his lips are moving
this is so funny lol
all those looks on bidens face are pricless destoyed in a werd lol
trump is the president truly love the country
biden over trump any day
when is biden going to realize that the united states doesnt need nato all they do is piggyback off our country and it dont matter if it was biden as president or trump is president just look at their history theyve always piggybacked off of us so yeah trump got a point
its like watching 7 year olds stumble through a group debate for the first time the words said in this make me feel like im in primary school 5 11 year old
is this real to actual today im not an american so im confused isnt trump a felon isnt he in custody and not allowed to speak like anything in this manner regardless
you knowthe thing
so sick of the lies of this administration trump 2024
biden 2125this whole year
he have done abominatiom and have brough dow the country bidrn have been the wiest president
this nothing but a sheet show just a blame game no one explaining how theyre gonna fix what has been done
did biden really compare abortion to civil rights that is despicable trump2024
this is giving well my friends dont like you even ask my mom vibes
i really dont know much about politics but i do own a small business and the best my buisness ever was was when trump was in office precovid ive lost sooo much after covid and now a days people cant afford to get their hair done when they cant afford groceries and the tax and bills that went up js
as a nonamerican my condolences how did you survived the last years
i dont know about that joe i have a lot of military family members and when we have big family gettogethers yeah my family military members and their military friends if this would have been another country biden would have been having a dirt nap and this is coming from military people if he thinks our military is backing him up hes going to feel very very mad come election sleepy joe got to go a few times he look like he wanted to go to sleep while he was standing there
i am a diabetic and i pay over 200 for my novalog so thats a lie
this was a pain to watch one one side what was once an uninteresting but competent administrator is showing signs of age on the other a convicted criminal and pathological liar these are the best options the two parties could come up with
co takiego z rosja konszachty jkto robil aniloliowie aknej
please someone get a 35yearold president for the us for elections instead of having to choose between 2 expired presidents
i used to be a dem ill be voting rep this year i cant trust the dems no more
biden abandond us your vets are living in the streets he is a lier look around ask your vets i feel for them
we are entertaining the whole world now stop embarrassing that old men let him go enjoy the days he has left
they passed marijawana and took bidens pill money he had coming in
wouldve loved to hear the response more accessible mental health treatment for the fentanyl crisis not whatever garbage filler of a response that was but hey real solutions arent for us
i really dont know much about politics but i do own a small business and the best my buisness ever was was when trump was in office precovid ive lost sooo much after covid and now a days people cant afford to get their hair done when they cant afford groceries and the tax and bills that went up js
there is no nation that wouldnt wanna trade with us sure in a country where you have to live from tips
drinking game every time biden says the idea take a shot youll be drunk before you know it
here we go with the storming of the capitol cnn haha stay on point biden is a wreck of a president distraction from how terrible bidens foreign policy is working out
trump ran laps around this fool
we found ourselves in a situation where heres the deal
have you fired anybody before joe joe
why is the intro so dramatic looks staged
trump is are president
its over
drinking game ever time biden says idea take a shot youll be drunk before you know it
joe answered all the questions and he knew all the fact now he get chocolate chip ice cream
everyone has their faults and weaknesses along with our government needing improvement which candidate has filed bankruptcy multiple times and broke contracts with small businesses after work was completed who is always right with everyone else being wrong which one takes responsibility for their own mistakes who has had more comments proven wrong by fact checkers who has fired everyone around him and showed no respect for others think about which one has had more of their associates being charged with crimes and going to jail
i was going to take a shot with every the idea but couldnt afford it
wow 15000 new jobs in a country of 360 million wow i bet youre so proud
really seriously exist someone that consider biden be able to do anything really are we looking at the same person he is undoubtedly ridiculous really am i the only one that think that is so crazy that this is really happening
biden talking is like ai images writing you can spot a few letters and words here and there but in the end its gibverush connecting a few sentences
i think the rich need tax cuts why it brings money back to america if our bosses get tax cuts they can pay and hire more so the business down the street that once had tax cuts now has to close and fire everybody because they cant afford to pay people because taxes are so high thats basic economics
joe biden should apologize to americans for running for president
a 100 doll basket of groceries is now 200 and i live in small town
2125 who loves this scene
qparaphrased childcare biden im the best trump no im the best q paraphrased childcare more expensive than rent any ideas trump im the best biden no im the best
notice how biden squints his eyes to read the scripts its like hes not even there hes just saying what he sees
biden and the democrats lost this won watch the end when biden leaves the stage he side steps down the stairs
james buchanan is the1 worst president in the usa
he keeps saying idea but did he even try to find out why they attacked the white house on jan6 if he went and actually try to work and find out he would have known
the lack of respect between them two also does this remind you of a puppet show were the puppets are always arguing back and forth
support d trump
i cant believe what im hearing in this debate u can see clearly that biden will and would do anything to ruin trump
brandon old brandon
im not even 10 minutes in and its literally just them throwing shots at eachother
in this video i see 1 guy who can fight and 1 who cannot even express himself i do not doubt who should sit in the white house
god help us
are these two really talking about golf during a presidential debate wow just wow
has anybody even asked why trump was on epsteins list i wonder
president trump debates to president airobot
the bidens ought to be ashamed of themselves for letting joe go out there and look like a walking corpse it was painful to see him struggling like that the whole time
oh god these people wicked to biden yall dont realize the man is hardly breathing wow
this is all theater what a joke
who is ruling america
i really think biden believes all what he is saying because that is what his handlers told him everyone who is watching american news knows that trump is correct when he says america is a failing country it is no secret biden is the only one in the world who believes otherwise on top of that ignorance he is the biggest liar of them all
poor biden his wife is mean for letting him get on stage and making a fool of himself like that hes obviously dealing mental and health issues i just seen an article that stated the reason he was so off is because he does better between 10am and 4pm if anyone has dealt with the elderly that called alzheimers and or dementia stop torturing biden and put trump back in office thats who should have been in office this whole time trump
no one and no two
biden looks frightened and needs to be taken to bed its obvious hes not fit to be running a country and should retire and rest he is just a face with paper and instructions he wouldnt be able to do this debate without his ear piece telling him what to say
if these arent robots then idk what they are theres no way people like this exist
joe biden unluckily is too oldhe seems to be so weakhis voice is only one sign for this weaknesstrump is rhetorically excellent nevertheless he is a liar
they want you to pay 6 of your paycheck for social security meanwhile they selling billions of dollars to ukraine these guys are nuts
he speaks like a robot glitching
is this even real
i love how these are the only 2 options
they held this debate before the parties officially choose their candidates for a reason this wasnt a debate this was the puppet master making the puppet walk the plank now all democrats see what republicans already knew this gives the dnc an opportunity to switch biden with someone with higher brain power and arms that are more posable than a lego i really hope whoever they might pick is further left than biden
to non americans insisting on biden to be their democratic candidate is mind boggling is there no one else
im trying my best to understand what biden is saying
the main thing is that both of them standing straight for 1 hour
trump is a scammer
kamala harris best opponent for trump any other please
donald trump the world pease men he want stop 3rd word war
are you so for serious this cannot be the people you guys are choosing for president in your country
cnn the presidet of each country is elected by reach people
this was planned by deep statealex jones and roger stone and many others have said for over a year they will replace biden with michele obama this bad debate was part of plan that is why the news people all turned against him all at once in lockstep
biden starts the debate saying you need to limit the rent prices oh so the government knows better than the owners how much they need to rent it for
were so cooked
he didnt deny why he left our borders open smh
no one broke down doors at the capitol bldg on january 6thtucker carlson proved it guards let them in its been filmed
this debate is a joke everyone knows military especially cia controls america
the way trump dodged the question about climate change says a lot
its cruel to make an old man pretend being a president for another 4 years
keep watching how people speak and dont pay close attention yll americans make a bad decision yll will regret it team biden all the way
whats up with bidens forehead that thing is nuts
sorry but abortion should be stopped by preventing the problem and taking birth control not taking a pill to kill the fetusdo we get relief from other mistakes we make noo we mess up bad at or job we deal with consequence and i feel same with abortion its murder in my eyes and my savior jesus christ love you all
thumbs up if you see the allseeing eye in the 2024
gheeno one mentions the minsk accords the eu and usa nato signed nato was not to border russia ukraine ukraine agreed to never to be in nato anyone care for truth anymore nato is a criminal organazation nato and euusa ignored the minsk agreements this is horrific complete dishonesty
oof
11624 what did i heard
american money for american people not ukraines war or the ukraine presidents and generals pockets how long can it last before america sends out a mayday call
biden has that 100 yr old gasp when talking its almost like his meds are wearing off then he brought up sex with a porn star in the debate i dont know what hes talking about i dont even think he knows what hes talking about trump
trump says literally anything biden the idea
biden looks lost and confused trump looks determined i just cant trust someone to work and lead this country out of the gutter who cant even work his way through a sentence
let me just say as an australian that was very entertaining
a couple dusty old queefs in my opinion
immigrants that were allowed to cross the border were given medicaid with fertiity benefits i am so sad for our country we should not have to work 2 jobs with a college degree just to keep our bills paid living paycheck to paycheck
bidens bits are probably impossible to subtitle
can anyone explain to me why the us thinks its a great thing to support israel
why arent either of them answering any of the questions theyre asked
biden told me to check online its actually linkins predeser that was voted worst pres
trump nobody likes him i personally despise him everyone hates him biden youre a liar pants on fire
facts trump trump did some great things
its like donald trump debating ozzy osbourne
biden is the worst american president ever he had no match on donald trump trump did what he thinks the best for american
nice speech love from china
wow i cant believe that the current president really is standing there trying to say that he has done anything even close to what president trump had done for the american citizens as soon as biden took over gas prices started going up and everything else through our great country also jobs became harder to find truth is jobs were so much more plentiful
having watched the full debate i believe biden is simply too old for this role he doesnt seem fit and his performance was quite concerning i was surprised he could stand for that long to be honest in contrast i think trump can do a better job and we need someone like him in office
i wonder what happens if eckhart tolle becomes the president of the us
25thamendment elderabuse prosecute dr jill
it should never be allowed past n 4 months i also find it very hypocritical that you would be against an abortion at 4 months tops and yet you can flat out murder a living breathing person as a punishment
ironically asking american dont u have better candidate than these two old kids
this is the be
good morning its me for real aka clarence spencer aka meat meat good morning
plain and simple fjb trump2024
and its very sad i dont like both parties but its very clear biden team got trump convicted cuz they are scared he will become president how unfair and dirty is american politics we are savage and im embarrassed to be living in the usa im actually researching places to retire in the future america is not land of the free we will still pay lots money even after we retire no ease of life tbh it only makes me want to vote for trump more now that he is convicted just to say fu to the baby boomers democrat destroying our beautiful country im not team republican or democrat im team me and the public opinion i base my choice on how i live daily when trump was president everything did seem more calm in the world prices were lower and taxes steady not to much hardcore war biden president food prices gone up i have nothing against immigrants but theyre are seen to be to much of them coming in rapidly we can barely take care of our citizens let alone rapidly welcoming immigrants to come in another mouth to help n feed biden president so many chaos and war happening around the world as of 2024 its crazy how it definitely feels like the democrats biden team are getting richer and im an average middle class trying not to be in the poor zone even if im poor i might be better off cuz then i can get free government cheese like how obama hilary biden likes to support section 8 people which is not fair for hard working middle class like me who dont qualify for those benefits
seriously conversation between 2 candidates to american presidential trumpyou are childish biden no you are b you said that t no i didnt its a lie b no you are lying b you did that t no i didnt
when trump said joe our country is being destroyed as you and i sit up here wasting time in this debate this shouldnt be a debate heartfelt concern indeed
they take the life of the child after birth ummmmm
train is coming no more stopping trump 2024
joe the idea biden
trump said he wanted clean water but flint is still without water joe said that america is number 1 polluter in the world thats false china is
humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty dumpty had a great fall all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put humpty together again
thats actually a pretty good system a fair coin toss to decide positions no audience and microphones muted between answers here in the uk its a sham we get a bias channel who conveniently decides the positioning who allows the two main leaders to talk over each other and achieve nothing and a handpicked totally onesided audience
whys trumps time seems short then bidens
the world correcting trump the us became a 3rd world nation when trump was voted in biden inherited a joke
trump when he starts talking
its not that biden is too cowardly but that wall street financial capital is too cowardly they want nothing more than to make more money all day long
what has the world come down to the most powerful nation on this planet has not one able and capable person to lead seems like integrity wisdom and hope are a thing of the past sad
trump trumped biden its just the abortion i biblically cannot support but i liked how trump roasted biden on how he let everyone on this country
prof biden got to hit clearity tho
17 million views and thats just wsjs uploading many many people viewed this debate
funny how the huge crowds at every trump rally is ignored yet every good detective will include pictures and videos to back up their claims
biden just lost the nation
i hope the left now realize that these new rules for debates are hurting biden the reason why biden didnt look as bad in their first debate is because trump didnt let him speak half the time here trump has no choice but to let him speak and with every sentence that comes out of bidens mouth he buries himself deeper and deeper
i was making money when trump was president
biden its ityhbvn
i was in the comments sections before i even started the video and you guys did not disappoint
at least the old man biden answered the initial question trump talked about what he felt like
this is funny
the idea
2226 brandon just speak to them im dead
as a non american im excited for this nonsense i need some entertainment
i love the way dana says idaho at 1318
trump is on record saying he doesnt like his war heroes captured in reference to john mccain so much so that he wasnt allowed to attend his funeral and you want us to believe you didnt say suckers and losers
the idea biden new drinking game for next debate annoyed of hearing it every time he spoke
we iranians love trump because he does not pay ransom to dictators and muslims
rules for a debate my lord the left are going to make sure nothing goes trumps way absolute shambles
why would president biden debate formal president trump
why would president biden debate formal president trump
theres something wrong with this video bidens nose isnt getting longer
i used to be on trumps side since even obama did not elected the second time i even wanted to write a song for him to help election time after biden recognize armenian genocide first president that did not lie that he is going to recognize and after did not recognize like others i never can forget and allways will be thankfull for that thank you thank you thank you mr biden god bless you and when i heard that mr trump is talking about biden son that is so shamefull to hit the person under the belt hes son is not a politician why you remembered him that is not takes you higher if someone is doing something like that it means he can do almost everything for president chair on my opinion i still have a respect to trump for other things and i would be on his side if his oponent wouldnt be mr biden but as much as biden in politics i will suport him and its very important to be very clear election to show peoples opinion because otherwise can happen things that is not exepted understanded and much more who ever is winning it should be real on my opinion to go forward and not get back or put the world under the risk
our economy is so bad now that 2 aged seniors have to be fighting for just a termed position
he said small black businesses lol
trump said his retribution will be success meaning tax cuts lowering fuel costs probably building the border wall kicking out the illegal immigrants who already have criminal records from their home countries creating new jobs negotiating with putin and zelenski to end that war bringing inflation down etc not going after his political opponents
the sad part is that this is not a sitcom its reality
idiocracy is here
thirty three minutes in and i think bidens acting like a proper statesman and doing a great job and countering all of trumps balderdash
somewhere in the universe aliens understand bidens mumblings
you wouldnt think it was real but it is and now not just the usa has a huge problem
very sad he so ambitious mumbling creepy defense himself red so calm and politely
i do believe putin would have not started a war if trump was the usa president
this was a bunch of malarkey
i read the report where presidential historians voted trump the worst american president of all time biden was completely correct when he referred to their decision
no american flags on a presidential debate plenty of cnn logos lol what a joke
i want to come to amerika onley to se how it feel to be deported
wait theyre giving more time to trump rather than biden
what exactly i the presidency if a man like biden held that position for four years
biden for 90 of the debate
trump is right america its a joke at this point how can any country be respected with a president like this guy looks like a zombie he cant even articulate without reading his notes
people should decide now who are to lead if they cant then well it is what they have decided to live with in the next four years and it can be worse god knows than us all why he will allow only these two to contest
tens of millions of americans who are likely to vote for president trump will be voting against american democracy the more they know about what hes done yes the more they know about what hes done and theres a lot more coming hes got a lot of cases around the road coming around hes got a whole range of issues he has to face i dont know what the juries will do but i knew and i do know he has a real problem and so the fact thatjoe biden admitting to lawfare theres a lot more coming hes got a lot of cases around the road coming around hes got a whole range of issues he has to facejoe biden fully admitting to lawfare against president trump
both should be not allowed to contest age has taken toll of both trump is still untrustworthy biden is slow in what he wants to say and leaves a lot of ambiguity
when did babbling become a legit sport biden is gold on this im not voting for either but at least trump is alive
president cartman i mean trump
cnn is a useless news network as is most msm
if you listen carefully you can hear joe thinking
many thanks again cnn and please continue to keep it up thanks
maga 2024 trump really prepared for this im so proud
im just sad i have to wait 3months for snl to make a sketch about this
my grocery list has triple in price twenty dollars more is a joke do they do their own shopping cnn is a joke fire all of them for lieing
omg such a shame and this people teachnthe world how to behave
hear me out a term without a president
biden has overtaken trump as the funniest american president
this comment section is why they didnt want an audience
anyone else think he looks like that old guy from poltergeist 2
the world was at peace during trump era its actually between a war monger biden and a peace lover trump the biden killed thousands of kids in palestine
biden forgot american soldiers died during his administration because he hardly looked up from his watch during their dignified transfer ceremony
whats true and whats false whats the motive of the heart i can high five both on the issues presented to us we didnt address the issues of our nations core who ever becomes our next president how long will it take for that administration to affect the average american why is the rest of the world affecting how this country provides for itself trump stated a while back during his administration america is self sufficient we have no need for reliance on any other country i believe that actually politics is an area that cant be trusted the system is is in charge of a force unseen there is not one place on this earth that is honest and true war crimes is a charge fitting for all leaders to gain control blood will be shed war itself is the crime
probably weeks before
they gave him a list of the questions before he got on stage so he could have time to memorize the answers
the idea of trumps presidency is dreadful
i love you all but we need america much more in the lead service for gods sake and humanity all large president trump will come back by 2028 l think
3335 why this girl started from october joke americas
the i dont even know what he said part epic like this is michael jackson eating popcorn worthy epic
this is entertaining
election get the two jobseeker but one into number one job in the land plan it well so that a good outcome not insurrection again
do you people see biden he never closes eyes like normal he keep them all the time open like programmed what is this guy phhhh
freeplastine
yea biden didnt show up where was the fire and energy he had at the state of the union had it been that biden that showed up it would be a very different coverage im still voting for biden trump lied in every single response from when he botched the pandemic to trying to say biden lost more people then he did when that is factually not true
2024elections we the american people deserve a president that has the mental and physical capacity to do the job we need a president that will put america first not last and have policies that will be beneficial to all americans we need a president that gets it
i was waiting for more cannibal stories from joe at least it wouldve been interesting
3304 belarus nice nato country
and externally on world orders based foreign policy on human rights written on un chapter on american has got the capacity to do itsays former president obama please continue to sustain it for sake of humanity but you can do it alone mostly you need russian russian because a bird does not fly with a wing
how could they say groceries went from 100 to 120 i pay twice as much on groceries from just two years ago its truly insane how high everything is
thank you for keeping comments open unlike cnn channel
selfish at this point potus sleepy joe is being selfish and stubborn and not listening to us the american people when everyone is telling him to step down sleepy joe is so desperate to cling onto to power sleepy joe doesnt care about we the american people
prices of homes are up 50 are you kidding not 30
jb should stay in home with nurse it only shows there somebody else is steering this country
the idea that i sat threw that entire soiled diaper is absolute eh ei da malarky
if biden really thinks roe v wade overturn was this big of an issue for him hes had over 3 years already to change it back why now is he saying he would do it in his next term if he didnt do it already and isnt doing it now while he still has the power to do it if think biden is being disingenuous on this topic also our culture has changed dramatically over the last 51 years are those scholars that biden is using as his support for his stance even alive anymore i doubt it we have different scholars now and a different paradigm and a totally different culture back in 1973 when roe v wade was passed my parents never even locked the house door at night nor the day while at work and they left their keys in the cars ignition all of the time and never locked the car doors when they werent in the cars and never locked the car doors when they were in the car we didnt even use seat belts then nor did cars have headrests it was a different time back then biden cant use the scholars of 51 years ago a to support his stance
3243 so basically were at war with russia
lets not act like trump isnt on mental health meds also so its not to much better with him plus hes a hot head he will have us in a nuclear war so yeah chose wisly is right
im pretty sure you wont be around in ten years
2 wars going on now biden is feuling both wars
it is unbelievable how trump lies to the viewers faces just one point under trump and until the end of his term the stock market was never higher than it is now under biden especially from the second year onwards the stock market has risen massively 2nd the border reinforcements in the south have been actively blocked by trumps republicans for the last three years americans vote for wisdom not for arrogance and stupidity
about internal policy on welfare and security not to be based on white supremacys this could be a wild wind that may consume america which the present is still fixing
i think camila harris should take over until trump becomes president elect
watching biden makes me feel uncomfortable guy looks like a corpse
one devil complaining about another devil
provided thousands of millions of jobs i really dont get half of what this guy is saying and when i do it seems a random flow of words with no meaning
whod they have coach him up at camp david doc rivers good grief
from where biden is reading
this is like watching two old men fight over the last nutter butter
let obama talk on behalf of joe biden believe pr biden still not lost his potential talking aloud expressing flow of taught on stage making decisions on the table in the office is very different victory to pr biden
bleach
hi all presidency is number one job for the two jobseeker on cnn platform
2024elections potus sleepy joe should step down if sleepy joe truly cares about america he would step down sleepy joe is an embarrassment for america and what he displayed during the debate was quite alarming because world leaders watched
my comment was delited mid comment because i am pro trump trump is 100 beter for the country over biden harris newson take a look at the boarder take a look at california and kamala is about as dingy as they come have you ever seen her answer somple problems
joe biden in the beginning of every sentence the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea the idea
i think he has cold and breathing with his mouth
clean up on 46
trump is a real man thats what we all need real men
whos in favor of having a golf match between biden and trump that would be a very accurate nonviolent way of settling their dispute over mental and physica competence in a spectatorfriendly manner
just remember america you got what you asked for if this could remain an american problem youd have my sympathies
the idea is that number one once upon a time there was a dream this is number 1 number 2 the dream was called american dream the idea is humm this was number 1 number 2the idea is lost
the moment mr biden walked onto the stage and waved at ghost audiences i knew he was going to do very poorly in this debate
i pay taxes too yall dont vote for trump
listen to joe trump cant be trusted
the most biased debate towards the democratic party ive ever seen and trump still humiliates them
notice when trump was asked about january 6th he ran around the question as usual an didnt want to address his part in that incerrection he is a big liar an a cheat
hes on putin side vote for joe wake up yall he wont answer any questions they throw at him he think he slick he a snake dont trust him at all wake up america he not are jfk he lies a lot
if you know the movie life of brian biden is the preacher with the least watchers under the balcony
if we have to go to war its going to be in the trillions
now this is called stand up comedy of slaves
all choice is an amendmenti was using the choice program2014 he included all vets to use the local area dental and medical facilities closer than the va my dentist in my town doesnt take us but i reimbursed for travel
trump is the world leader biden is the worst president in history

america
presendent trump is the best presendent of the world like duterte
youve got the morals of an alley cat is spectacular
how do you know if its a terrorist unless they got caught 160 countries bp data means theyre doing their jobs to gather information
2645 president trump is so hilarious in his delivery who would say such lol he is so funny loll
5559 we findehf wemfinehehf fehning houseing for black americans
042 in their rematch ive never heard such a supposedly democratic process described in such a way before
howd texas get more seats there are people moving to texasillegals can get counted for seats in the house 2 more for texas
i be happy to have a driving contest cracking up
the absolute cringe
trump should win 2024 election
favorite part of the whole debate biden asked if he thinks he is healthy enough to serve another term trump and biden fighting over who is the better golfer to determine who is healthy enough to serve as president
trump did very well biden is a sad example of presidentyou can tell he has dementia by just looking at him when he speaks it is a certainty
did he call him out to a game of golf and said he couldnt carry his own golf bag
i love how lets go brandon stutters with every lie spews from his pie hole
mrtrump avoided 90 of the question that is been asked in this debatewhat an irony im afraid to say this but infact mrtrump should be happey that hes now at least regarded as former us president for the public even if they dont want that because it was by the virtue to regard any former president as their then president to be recorded in history even though the entire world knows hes a sick dictator who wanted to dominate every nation by force
hate monger or feeble i dont like these options
at one time i thought biden is gonna fall honestly man bring someone who can talk
united states is a non indepandant state and is governed by aipac
other countries dont respect us because of what donald trumps administration did
biden is right im seeing it with my own eye with veterans
biden talked like a robot and trumph talked like a clever and arrogant boy
this guy says everything is a lie
trump is a manipulator he talk and says nothing on and on and on biden is a legend
lol it doesnt matter about saying what you want to hear but see the truth
president joe biden was not well on the date of the debate this can be seen from the tone of his voice otherwise he did fairly well in the debate
it would be cool in future debates if we could someway probably through ai provide real data in a real time visual when they start saying theres a lot of data that proves
anyone heard a fart exactly at 11625
im not american although ive seen some excerpt of the debate when i came across this video i went straight to the comments and found way more intelligent prose in there and funny which is a very nice style
though i am not american and i cant vote i choose biden
thank you for being a friend in gotham
although l am not a great fanor like the personality of mr trumphe is by far the better president for the good people of the usa business orientated that help create work however people like biden are simply puppetsand below him are the scavengers as a result people suffer
trump is a genius the wayy he speaking know all of it
where are all those biden voters in the comments we have been tellin you his brain is broken now everyone can see it for themselves lets go brandon
i just watched that video of pelosi confessing that it was her fault wow
read your notes joe because you cant remember lol
straight to the comments
president trump is sharp but not politically smarthe had the opportunity to kill off president joe biden in this presidential debate but he kept going off key and off record
the idea
bidens brain during this
trum know what to do for usa but biden sllsllsl talk
yes pull out of nato nato is the us every other country is just tagalongs
reading comments is more entertaining than this show
i support iseral and trump
1154 biden cant even speak without losing his train of thought and hes supposed to be the president we have a clear winner
this is really like watching two old folks arguing in an old folks homethis is not a debate epic entertainment
england love trump great man who loves his countrysooner he is back in office the better the world will be
were screwed regardless one guy wont directly answer questions and the other guy cant form a coherent sentence when hes trying to answer questions
thanks for keeping the comments open unlike weasel cnn
beans the game
colorado has blood on its hands thanks to polis polis agrees to 9 month abortions
president trump wins trump 2224
as a european this is both entertainment and pure gold idk why
governor polis in colorado is just like the state of virginia governor polis is doing the same thing he agreed to up to after the birth to murder
biden is the only one who could make trump look like the better vote we need new blood why are these two unpresidential individuals our only choices i will not vote for trump as he should not be in such a position biden should have retired a few years ago both men are bad news for this country the overlords want trump to win to further usher in an authoritarian state the us is on the verge of collapse the people have largely been systematically bastardizes failure to pay the price of liberty
it seems biden is reading somewhere
trump has won in the higher courts thank god biden is the real criminal
appreciate the cool and calmess to wait and respond i appreciate this debate not like pakistani or indian politician speaks and interupt others at least they have pateince to wait and respond
2912 he is speaking from the heart about this
biden is a liar he should be in prison for what hes done
so i have a question for the two political parties in america who will give iraq weapons to protect itself who will protect iraqs influence from the corrupt iranians who will help iraq build its economy who will help iraq build a huge army to confront the iranian militias mansuf will protect iraq with his life and blood is he donald trump or not joe biden
if america chooses one of these two it will be the biggest shame
joe biden is a dam liar eggs under donald trump was 99 cents with biden in office eggs skyrocketed to 329 cents also you cant blame covid on trump when people voluntarilyinvoluntarily had to leave their jobs and filed for unemployment because of statelocal democrat policies also biden came up with these rules for the debate not the news all that money going to black areas are actually going to non american illegal immigrants look at chicago and new york as the smoking gun
the tariffs will definitely raise the price level of us your cost of living will be higher and the factories will never go back to america they may leave china for sea or africa
im embarrassed i live here sometimes a literal cartoon we live in
i understand the standard for choosing and electing presidents of the united states of america presently is at a free fall unlike what we had in the past in the likes of jfk franklin rooseveltbill clinton abraham lincoln and a host of other fantastic presidents
the blood against the crips
no country is scared of biden or respects like they do trump and trump is a great businessman man and puts our country first
have you guys seen the jjk mcdonalds collab
anybody voting for biden is an absolute fool
what a joke clearly both are not mentally and physically enough for the presidency my goodness
hmm this is going to be tough
thumbs up if you think biden peed himself during the debate
this elderly abuse is very hard to watch facepalm
cakewalk for trump
im surprised joe was able to stand as long as he did look like he missed his afternoon nap
how about white families its just poor people made poor by more jobless pouring over the boarder aca a joke working poor cant afford it what do we do we go without forget the nonsense black jobs white jobs black housing white housing still separate but equal yes equally bankrupt
joe looks like hes listening to an earpiece while trump is speaking
im european and this felt like an episode from a reality show have courage people cause in the end no one will help you stay true to each other and dont divide for those two
this is a typical compliment that you cannot argue to a person with mental illness it is a loosing end for trump i guess biden doesnt even know what he was saying
when you lie you pay i cannot believe that a sitting president can deliberately and blatantly lie to americans with impunity he should be held to a higher standard not a lower standard imagine artificial intelligence fact checking the president whoever he is instantly and when he is caught lying he is automatically fined and pays the opposing party 100 and this amount doubles with every subsequent lie this would go a long way in fixing things and could also be applied to the media free speech should not include deliberate lies to satisfy a corrupt agenda

trumps a beast best president in my life time
bidens speech sounds like his talking with food in his mouth
trump destroys him it isnt fair really biden is so elderly now
have trouble sleeping no need for valium or other precription drugs heres a natural treatement just listen to biden youll fall in a deep sleep like a baby
any chance people will realize there are more than 2 candidates instead of endlessly bitching about trump and biden probably not but we can hope
how about we get rid of both of them and elect another president
i still wanna know what 30 things that trump lied about in this debate i know of atleast 2 things that biden lied about
biden you should have never became president in the first placebye sleepy joe
if biden wins this year i might as well make a will soon because well be done
no notes sleepy joe has a pen in his hand but cnn says and dors nothing
the devil wears red tie
wthwhen biden approaches the podium he reaches down and grabs something under the podium later he is reading from something there arent supposed to be any papers or notes etc
we had gas almost under a dollar a gallon with trump in presidency tell me how inflation is lower
you can see evil in his red tie
trump is the worst of all time
where is the crowd
the majority of americans want trump back as our president
joe biden is a very bad politician
biden is so full of it
i wish we had younger candidatesthe lack of energy is scary and sad we should be taking care of the senior citizens of the world not letting them run our world
dont make fun of biden bc about 13 of those reading this will be the same way when youre old we just dont know now
yo momma is fat no yo momma is a perfect example of modern us politics
donald trump with dana white as vp is precisely what our country needs and what the world needs to see
im only here because i know this is gonna be stupid
i feel like joe biden is being abused by his carers familyobamas ppl why is he standing there at all the poor guy has no idea why is biden getting last chace to reply and when they go back to trump to reply they give him an add on question seems rigged to make it easier for biden trump is no saint but he is a good business man i dont like trump i dont have to but i would vote for him if i had a vote he sees america like a business which is why he will be way more successful for americans than sleepy joe
our cia has also been setting up and loosely maintaining fentanyl centers supplied by china in prep to phase south american states its the same reason the boarders had to be opened theyve been hiring cartels to replace gangs with more heartless business minded pawns
if biden opens his mouth hes lying
who wants a side of lobster
joes family needs to take him out and try to keep the pride of there family if any intact
trump his presidency is the worst in history and we are here debating it and we dont need to even debate it lol
trump should get two more terms first for himself and one for the homies
just talk to him brandon
i made 60 k last year and i paid 22k in taxes i never paid that much 5 years ago
wait what happened to no notes
i love how cnn in the beginning try to say that groceries were only up by 20 when really theyre up more like 100 to 200 another thing is he talking about corporate greed but you get corporations have been making a whole lot more money under his administration than under any other administration and now he wants to fix the problems that he created himself people are not stupid people know that these problems started after biden took office ready to spend 180 at the grocery store is now almost 400 and thats no lie fjb get out of the way and let trump fix the economy that biden destroyed
man i dont understand nothing biden said his voice alone a reason im voting trump
what a putz fjb
we still dont know what hunter was doing in ukraine for 80000000 a year from ukraine hunter was not qualified to d o anything there in ukraine zelinsky appears to be collecting a lot of money during this current war
mrdonadis right
biden sounds like president ruto of kenya always blaming the past government
i cant stand biden the way he talks and sounded so annoying i constantly skip bidentimes
biden shouldve went home and ate ice cream
watching this the second time mr president biden wasnt as bad as i initially thought he still had some of the stumbling yet what he had to say had some punch and weight to it while you know the other dude just lied the entire time
is anyone having a hard time trying to understand biden too or is that just me
best president of my lifetime trump 2024
i really dont know what he said at the end of that sentence i dont think he knows either fell out of my chair laughing at bidens face after that one
good god whats happened to our nation whats happening to us that these two are our finest to become our leaders people we are doomed
im worried for america these 2 candidates are not qualified to be president
whats worse biden screaming in whisper or moving in claymation
biden is finished i can hardly hear him
opens up presidential debate joe biden and donald trump are not oiled up and dancing on the floor in a retirement house day ruined
trump speaks as if he has not been found guilty he is a criminal but it seems he does not have a clue about it
number one by the way the idea the idea number one by the way by the way the idea number one
trump uses facts biden uses emotional stories that are lies how he gets away with those lies is mind blowing
even without the debate the difference is trump love his country and the american people he is for us biden is a professional lier and with the help of the lies the fake news media tell 247 brainwashing biden has almost flush america down the tolite
biden seems and looks incompetent during this debate trump looks mad the questions for the debate were good questions to ask
nah america is cooked atp im moving back to india
i was watching republican senator john kennedy question doctors dance and circle around their answers about abortions he actually held up cards of diagrams of fetuses and than questioning about them about performing late abortions it was pretty gruesome and barbaric and even they were uncompfortable admitting the truth about the procedures its sick
comments say it all people are finally starting to wake up there actually may be hope for humanity
why didnt you let obama fill in for you sir
biden doesnt even know or remember what he is talking about in his own sentence beginning to end
this country is doomed
trump just came to try and to tint a different picture that is not there about biden
question why did pence do so badly in the start of the race he seems like a standout guy was vp for trump why didnt he get support
weres all the leftist and trump haters at now
if the democrats do not replace biden with someone that can carry on a conversation then i guess america deserves to lose their country someone who says no one is above the law except me does not belong in the white house
i said it before this went down and was only proven right its not going to be a debate its going to be a massacre now the only question is when will they announce that biden is stepping down from running for a second term the announcement will go something like this the whole battle to beat medicare took a dire toll on old joe he can no longer run for a second term were really sorry about all those getting raped by their inlaws spouses brothers and sisters you will no longer be able to take that pregnacy to term then have the baby killed after being born
when did trump say that
trumps so much better
wish there was counter of how many times biden says we find ourselves in a situation by the way significanty
americans watching the debate me straight to the comments
5700 bidens 1st home 10k tax credit and student loan forgiveness is for everyone not just black people do not act like you did black people any favors biden you didnt
why does biden sometimes look like hes seeing a ghost in that room
usa media asking asking questions of public indian media kya aap violet rakhte ho konsa wala
not an inch to the east nato gets what it pays for in terms of breaking promises
when he squints it is bc hes reading something too lord please save us as our worldly leaders whom are completely fake abuse and control driven the enemy lord is working hot but you are righteous in and great in deliverance
biden looks like someone who just got knocked out and was administered smelling salts the entire debate especially when hes speaking and even more when hes listening to trump he doesnt look in good shape at all
10045 where am i
to those of you that voted for joe biden this is what we have been trying to tell you for the last 4 years
am i the only one who thinks this is a game show of pretending to be a politician comedic stand up competition
4945 maybe my favorite part of any debate ever
oh you want a minute to respond biden go ahead ill give ya a minute to respond mr trump thats your time you can spend it adress zombiden or answer the question i hate cnn clearly propganda news
how brave is wsj to leave the comment section open
they were worried about trump so they silenced the mics they should have cut off biden after the sentence out of biden by the way trump won by a landslide
the eloquence of trump just tips me down
trumps trying not to burst out laughing and so am i bidens mind is mashed out
that grocery inflation is a conservative number the cost of groceries is more like 50 higher now when i go shopping for groceries
2 old men biden need retire and take care himself he is barely walk will fall down let trump take over make america strong again keep our country safe
better watch this rfk jr the real debate
how scary it is that biden is our current president shame on you
so how long did bidens nose grow tonight
i am from nepal thank you joe biden and donald trump for your time i really enjoyed full entertainment
oh good freedom of the press works
cnn has to be embarrassed for this debate and biden should not be running for president the man doesnt know what is going on he doesnt remember or knows there is a video of him saying exactly what president trump said its pathetic that the democrats are supporting him to run for president just pathetic by the way exactly who is running our country because its not biden and if it is god help us
if biden hadnt been struck by a dew hed be the clear choice but the cia is childish enough to think the world cant put 2 and 2 together so here we are getting gaslit
thats 1 2
trump 100 owned this debate
on the news they said biden will only be available until 4 pm from now on lol
i miss when biden was catholic
trump trump trump vote for trump we dont want sleepy joe we want someone who can talk a clear sentence vote for trump
many europeans in the comments making little beraring comments talking about whats wrong with americaamericans whileonce againtotally ignoring the words and actions of a madman right in their own backyard sounds like you all have bigger peoblems than you think but of courseonce again youll look to us to fix those problems once youve ignored them for too long right right
twelve minutes in biden starts to lose concentration this is a heartbreaking site to behold
quote of the night trump lets stop acting like children biden youre a child
how embarrassing for you people on every level
i am not for biden but i feel very sorry for him its really elder abuse what jill is allowing what wife of any kind would betray a husband this way i have seen 8 minutes and am afraid because i know this debate gets worse for biden as he runs out if steam lets say
2019 trump was mumbling and being directed o camera
cnn the comedy channel
no worrs under trump no drafts necessary
many of people that coming in the usa are not terrorists they just have no other option because of the impact of international politics
these two men spend the whole debate bashing each other rather than giving examples of what theyre going to do better they obviously have no clue what the debate is supposed to be neither answer any questions thoroughly they end their time with statements about the other neither of them is good for america period i hate that people cant see that this whole debate just made me mad america is a disaster and this debate shows that the future of our country is going to be no better
when i see debate im easily say no ones controlling usa now
biden had a good start that is good i like these rules because both men were so unruly 3 years ago during their debate
trump burying biden in this guarantees another pandemic will be manufactured
the saddest part is that there is no third option
number one i like vanilla ice cream number two i like it on a waffle cone grumble grumble thats how id solve global warming mr president the question was how would you prevent a global war
they need to put the secklers in prison how do you open a legal dope house and lie that its not addictive and reward salesmensaleswomenand doctors that up the mgs of patients to assure strong addictions make 14 billion dollars and only get fined 6 billion leaving 8 billion in profit while its proven that they broke many laws along the way and many people died behind these laws broken and they never step one foot in a police station let alone a prison baffles me big pharma are the biggest dope dealers in the world but as long as you play the game by giving millions to candidate parties and have buddies in high places i guess you can break the law kill millionsstart a pandemic and still walk away with billions while a young poor kid just trying to feed his family off the black market that you created get caught with a few pills go to jail for years and decades in some instances
god bless president trump
trump is our only hope
the amount of times biden said the idea is astounding
this was way past joes bed time i almost feel bad for him watching this but he was the one that wanted to do this debate so badly now the whole world knows he has dementia and can barely stand anymore even after practicing for this debate for a whole week in a bunker just a disastrous performance having this guy as our president for the last 35 years has destroyed our country i pray trump can fix this mess biden has caused when he is elected we need him more now than ever
hey cnn why did biden have notes and a penin his hand and still fail to read them properly
jesus biden is a disgrace to america we need a president like trump
trump national issue border issue economic conditions etc biden the idea
he is saying putting is a war criminal yet from what ive seen on the front lines of the russian ukraine war ukraine is committing just as many if not more war crimes than russia ever thought about
this is horrifying out of almost 390000000 people these 2 are the best we can find our country is doomed
i feel bad for biden watching this debate
as a black man i will put this on my mothers grave i promise you that i would have never ever voted for trump because of all the silly stuff however as i listen to him i will vote for him for 2 reasons our soldiers and being a retiree and the boarders this current president has done nothing for those issue he has just made it worse look the boarders its a hot mess they are coming over taken all kinds of jobs
11616 did trump just soil himself whats that noise
how dare you accuse trump in supporting nazis when you biden send money to ukraine that has openly supported nazi ideals and have a nazi as their heroes they marched in the center of kiev with tourches but you send billions of dollars to thwm what a hypocrete
notice biden didnt even think about denying the fact that he left us citizens and troops in afghanistan
summary of this you lie what a level of debate
i think biden has dementia and they are hiding it and squeezing every bit of life out of him
the whole world is blowing up over him this couldnt be more true about biden
why cnn doesnt allow comments
can we please get biden out the running we need better options
this is cruel putting biden up there
the left is toast and im here for it
i made the mistake of rewatching the debate biden needs to do the right thing and not only drop out but resign having kamala as president is terrifying but it is the right thing for the country
why are they not fact checked live
this is like being offered two meals that you cant eat because ur allergic to them
fjb trump2024
dana is so unfair when biden stumbles she quickly moves on to another question
last week michigan had 105 of its residents registered to vote in 2020 57 of the ballots voted
i love this historic debate people finally have to acknowledge trump is better
why is biden face expression so funny
mayorkas just signed an agreement with panama oscar blue ramirez has a video on yt
today chicago announced that theyre giving iis drivers licenses for safety in other words so they can vote call your state reps peeps
i wonder why americans voted for biden hes the most ridiculous person i have seen so much disinformation coming from his end
jill biden should be charged with elder abuse for not getting her husband to step down
lies from biden he said that putin wants the nato country of belarussa and that is just inaccurate belarussia is not a nato country plus the hosts already said what putins terms are and biden contiinues his propaganda of russia neing a bad guy of course he is a war profeteer and needs justification for his lies
trump will win stop the war
jt db are horrible journalist and terrible moderatorsway to go cnn
trump is delusional
this just hurts to listen to however biden catching fades from trump tho just get old joey outta office and into hospice already
they continue accussing trump of what happened during the pandemic all the countries suffered an economy drop president trump mandate was every governor of a state should deal with it according with the situation on that state they dont like to mention that some states did better like the state of florida thanks to the governor decisions there than other states in one way i feel sorry for biden he doesnt have kamala harris and nanci pelosi helping him not like they did much anyway president trump address the nation just like presidents in the past and not reading from papers written by some other people telling him what to say trump as a president has a better military mindset than biden thats why countries dont respect biden since he took office
biden forgot to kneel down before the debate lets go brandon
im in a small town in north iowa and these people are taking over our town
dana made a motion with her hand at one point but trying to hide it they probably edited it out rita caught it on sky news
please dont let biden be our president no american in their right mind cant possibly think that biden is competent to handle the load of the mighty usa he acts like he should be in a convalescent home no disrespect but hes not capable
zelenskys wife just became the first buyer of a bugatti turbillon 45 million euros he spent 15 million in jewelry at cartier earlier this year
the only thing i heard dana bash say during the debate was how nipley it was inside
wouldnt trump be the first president to come back into office instead of having his 2 consecutive terms or leaving after one
the idea
trump will win
its funny how trump looks at biden
bro something is wrong with biden
this is genuinely sad for the united states of america biden had strong highs but that wouldnt be longer than a minute compilation because he kept stumbling over his words and on the other side we have a criminal who would only lie and duck questions
groceries doubled or tripled they didnt go up 20
his little cough is from shortness of breath which you get from too much speed like adderall hes been doing it for several months plus his eyes barely blink lol
this video has been edited from the live version that was seen on the night of the debate once again changed to help biden
biden brought in criminal illegal immigrants to get votes kill our economy to make this nation closer and closer to become a communist country the truth is our flag is nothing to feel proud of anymore god have grace and mercy on this nation
first question is already biased and not true a basket of groceries that cost 100 then is not 120 now its more like 220 also for 120 you arent really getting much for a family of 4 that may be 23 meals tops jake tapper you are a joke just like your network the commie news network
exelent job cnn welcome back
trump did more for this country than any president in 20 years joe is like an empty puppet how people in conspiracy documentaries explain the presidency but in real life a basket of groceries that was 100 under trump is now 300 under biden you think im complaining about 20 bucks
11803 fentanyl and its byproducts went down for awhile no it didnt joe i did opiates for 14 years ive been clean for a little over a year fentanyl is everywhere
poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids joe biden
this is the best debate ever
prescription drugs price has gone down and u get to use that savings at the grocery store and gas station thanks joey a couple minutes in and im fuming this should be good
one single example stood out among many statements that seemed dishonest from joe biden he said early in the debate that insulin would be down to 15 but during the closing statements that price had changed to 35 joe biden in almost certainly being dishonest to the american people and just making up these numbers to tell everyone what he thinks they want to hear in order to get the votes he desires
biden is delusional and has selected memory lost
not seeing how biden could go another 4 years
whos playing biden now
trump gas prices under 2 bidens gas prices 5 dollars and prices on almost everything has doubled because on our incompetent president
good bless trump i love him and hes our president
the man who going to make america great again
and when i was a child i thought people who ran for presidency had to be intelligent
not american but the world was more peaceful during trump
the democrats had the last four years to find or prepare a democratic presidential contender cant believe they are so surprised and shocked during and after this debate biden said he would only serve one term he should have stuck to this
biden sounds like every word he says could be his last sounds like a movie character before they die getting their last words out loool
joey is lost and pitiful
why not joe biden step down and let kamala harris run for the election because i dont think even donald trump should be president again he started many of the nonsense which going on in the world right now
this is embarrassing why biden hasnt from a single constructive sentence
the idea but the idea by the way the idea the idea
senior citizen vs senior citizen which one do you want to ruin our country
im not a fan of either of the moderators but they really did a good job not intervening and letting it play out according to the rules
you can tell obiden has a hiden earpiece why obama is talking to joe through his earpiece he turns away from the debate so he can concentrate on what obama is saying to him
4300 biden omg hes right but but i gotta think of somesomesomething
youre telling me that these are my only two choices
hey joe if you cannot perform the duties that the job you were elected to do including speaking on the debate stagehow can you be trusted to protect our country on the world stage the answer is you cannot and you have not
the next debate should take place in floridaand the next one in las vegas
kennedy is the remedy he can actually speak without insulting other canidates
climate change blah blah this ol world will be burning up soon
i lost count of how many claims were made about being the first president to _ the best ___ any president has ever achieved these two guys sound like theyre going to start debating which one of them is responsible for oxygen i breathe
wait so black people are blaming the government cause they commit crimes and go to jail
if you watched the debate and think biden won you need to seek help immediately biden has been a huge mistake has destroyed america and needs to just go away forever
i had to stop at 123and played it back at 2x for a laugh
why criticize joe biden for his part in the debate trump lied his way thru the debate does his actions fad so fast with people that he is right in his assessment that he could shoot some one and could get away with that comment has been referred to often and yet he believes he could pull this off that people are so under his thumb he shouldnt be allowed to run for any office in america please consider this before you support this ideology
biden cannot be running the country dems allow this our national security is in danger
the opioid crisis is manufactured by guess who
the truth about the last election is out a stuffed ballot is not a legal vote
trump makes a point biden the idea
the fact bidens wife allows this is disgusting get him out for america
if any of these debates have an audience and no breaks joe is really screwed even worse than this
youre fired joe
billion trump and trillion biden its a big difference in his mouth of questioning its the same hahah
joe biden hasnt even been down to see migrant camps at the boarder or the obama biden cages
you want your country back you know whom to vote
our lives were safer and more lucrative under trump
cnn is pathetic
anyone 65 and older should not be allowed to hold any government job including running a country
trump has point in everything he said
and biden says hes ready to lead yeah right lead our country into the ground dont yell at at me for complaining about it i didnt vote for it
this is elder abuse
when i was in the military trump was president he actually came to visit us in alaska i got it on video and everything so trump definitely supports the troops
because of you joe
12651 what is going on
i gotta hand it to cnn you did a great job this time
number 1 and number 2
what happened i watched the past presidential debates all so fiery but this zzzzzz
who cares
the way this debate went they came this close to poking each other in the eyes
2856 i think joe had a creep glitch or just crapped his diaper
a question for american friends with over 300 million people in the us cant you really find two younger presidential candidates every time i see biden boarding a plane i feel like he will roll off the staircase
wow i wish groceries only went up from 100 to 120 its actually about 280 now
trump is using scare tactics to scare the american peoplehow shameful biden 2024
just cause alfred old doesnt mean you entrust the joker to take care of the bat cave
just cause alfred old doesnt mean you entrust the joker to take care of the bat cave
trump definitely made a lie on the va abortion policies im from virginia and they will not terminate a pregnancy after 5 months unless it is medically needed to save the life of the mother and i personally agree with trump so to watch lie like that is very disappointing
biden is insane biden checks his watch when 12 bodies came home then say not one military died under his watch afghanistan and now 600000 plus ukrainians dead no peace deal because they want their resources and a ten year warour kids will be drafted they want war so does lindsey and lockheed martin
biden is sick and the honorable thing to do the nation can handle kamala how does biden know that there are more charges against trump in justice department
trump should be checked by a mental institution
i think trump is gonna win in a historical landslide
2126 the way trump looks at biden as hes trying to get through talkingand then he says afterward i really dont know what he said at the end of that sentence i dont think he knows what he said either yo i nearly collapsed to the floor
shame on bidenobama to purposely destroy sovereignty freedoms and the lives of all the children gone missing images me ten years from now
both old guys debate to be us leader and us is old country
yeah what a great economy biden every time i go back to the grocery store food has gone up a little more pathetic that is when i can find food on the shelf such a sad time scary times
the idea that biden thinks hes qualified to lead is proof hes not
bidens face 1800
11625 who sharted
rfk wiped the floor with both of them too bad only 11m saw it on x and somehow zero saw it on youtubecnn claimed unprecedented copyright to us debate footage
you can clearly see trump is in much better shape and the strength of his voice a big difference doing much better than biden considering how close in age they are
im starting to think cloning people is a lie the dems would have better off with a clone with updated ai tech lol
i dont think biden sounds all that bad maybe a bit soft spoken with some minor slips but i dont understand why hes gotten such a negative response
joe you did such such a good job you answered all the questions wrong no sprinkles for you joe
shame on jill biden seriously
biden is societal that he doesnt know what hes saying
biden were in a situation where the idea ofand by the way
cnn fact checker later that night or the next day debunked just about everything biden said
the simpsons
its kind of rad that trump can stop wars by refusing to provide financial support
trump spitting facts and biden dont even know what day it is
i couldnt not laugh when trump would talk and biden
trump states facts and logistics biden repeats himself and stutters non stop he sounds so dishonest and out of it well done trump
its kind of rad that trump will stop the ukraine war before he gets into office
i dont understand why cbs news had their comments off in my opinion i absolutely agree that biden screwed up majorly with his slurring and pausing and zoning out how can a person like that run the usa
how dare this draft dodger talk anything about the veterans of the united states he did nothing for them
joe biden s brain is like scrambled eggs wow seriously embarrassing for the united states
i have to ask this so sorry has anyone thought about why the debate moderators asked trump if he would accept the election results if biden wins but failed to ask biden if he would accept the election results if trump wins i really think biden would have spontaneously combusted both should have been asked that questionimo
trump deserves to be our president he has a personaty of a third world leader
i actually think trumps trying to help biden because he knows bidens just getting old
we have laws on the border too and although rump doesnt feel like he needs to follow laws biden does he did not open anything he was following the law allah hes been trying to change but has not gotten support from republicans facts matter rump just says whatever he wants wether its true or not
they goin blame trump for climate change really yall
its true about the va and choice i worked for the va for 21 years i feel nobody did more for the va and vets was president trump
trumps using 5g while bidens still on dialup
put the baby down and well decide what to do with it what is he talking about taking a childs life after it is born is called murder and we already have laws covering that trump is such a buffoon and he just says whatever he said so many things that were false i cant even remember all of them
you are right president trump
watching this i can see why biden was unable to speak coherently near the end there were probably so many things that he wanted to say that he couldnt even decide in his brain what he was going to actually say there were just too many ridiculous statements coming from rump there are so many places to check him a person doesnt even know where to start lol
okaaaaayyyyy 30 minutes is all i can handle i agree with the one guy we need 2 fresh new canidates this is like 2 children fighting over a lollipop
funniest thing is bidens gonna win again anyway there is gonna be another van full of votes out of nowhere and bam another term of president senile as opposed to president criminal
biden is a disgrace this man is our president now no wonder our county is in so much trouble whos making all these new policies cause clearly he is not the american people need answers on this and make no mistake there will be more republicans voted into office
poor biden nock nock is anybody in this voided brain
remember 8 for eggs time for skeletor to go back to cartoons diaperstrump gave to the working class economy was righteous my mortgage was 3 try buying a house under slo joe trump 2024
the idea biden is so embarrassing
we the people will have president trump back in the wh
if joe resigns in july we will jobs early as january 2025 they have to stop lying about low unemployment job filing claims they are way off people have to get back on their feet and rebuild from the ashes he created in 2020
i want trump back
trump2024 we cant do anymore liberals
biden your absurd when you say trump put babies in cagesjesus christ biden get serious
the two worst candidates in history to be offered to the voters this november by the duopoly
im sorry but trump 2024 stop it this is the man for the job he say how he feel in its shows results when he get back in the white house
hi i hope you can help me my story today is my mama abandon me for another guy and forgot about me and i need to go to the adoption center but i dont know how that is a sad story for you to help me but i am sure that someone will take me to the adoption center until someone adopt me please help me to find a home and a safe space in this horrible place for my children to live with their adoption center they need help to find a shelter for themselves to go to stay at and be safe for themselves please and i am so thankful to have a good life to be in the family please help me and my family thank you
heres a challenge for anyone brave enough or crazy enough to try it watch the debate again and take a shot every time you hear the phrase the idea youll be totally hammered by the end theres a couple other repeated phrases but if you included those too youd either die before the end of the debate or if youre lucky end up in an icu needing a liver transplant lol
the latest excuse theyre making for biden is he had a cold
joe they support trump you need to go take a nap
joe what are you smoking everyone is laughing at us no one is admiring us
does anyone know of any good trustworthy media who has done the factcheck of what they both had said they kept calling each other liars and no looking back at it i have no clue what was said was true and what wasnt
president trump 2024 maga
i hated trump in 2016 now i realize he was attacked by the 1 that wants to run the world
shame on bidens advisors and his doctor wife he is not competent
biden sounds and looks like spongebob outta water hes so dry jesus pour some water on the man
rfk jr in november
bidens voice is frail with frail speaking spells weak in his wellbeing and can effect his thought process it doesnt matter but frailty in decision making is something that is there no doubt so whos really making the decisions for him if he cant them why do you believe you need him as president
trump blatantly avoided answering questions on what he would do regarding deportation climate change and opioid addiction the moderators let it slide why is this allowed this should be on the news the debate format needs to change to not let this happen
want to see something funny turn on closed caption
theres videos from inside shows some of the putting one trump gear in front of security or cops
yo is biden simply lying or is he delusional
joe is a such a total joke this is what cnn is a joke also
as a somali finally america have same presidents as a somalia welcome to 3rd world
bidens administration was responsible for the insurrection
imagine you are the incumbent with all the advantages that entails the entirety of your partys elites support you as does the media you control your opponent is a former reality show host and the first convicted felon to run for office in your nations history a man who you could argue is so outoftouch with commoners that he literally lives in _multiple_ giant golden towers with his name on it a man who has been the medias public enemy number one for nearly a decade all this and you still dont even stand a 60 chance of winning
okay trump you have got to get elected why is so stupid know this would have happened if he hadnt given away all those weapons that you trained and russia are buying off of the other guys biden is an enemy of our state and only the voters can take care of it by voting him out
biden is such a liar
this would be so much more enjoyable to watch if they were each given plinko chips or something to drop down a board they could earn their chips by providing a truthful answer judged by a panel the options at the bottom of the board could include things like earn a presidential pardon stormy segment 50000 for legal fees medical reports revealed and a rename the whitehouse cause this is just a clownshow now
most hilarious debate ever gj biden only person who could make trump look this good
they were about to ask biden a debate question and the pause to let him counter reply what trump through at him you can tell the news people are being controlled letting him gat back at him with what you can see some personal statements instead of producing a legitimate statement
joe sound like he been running for acouple of miles without water to the debate
so hes gonna give people money for a house based on their skin colour all i need to know thanks
toefl comprehension level biden
biden is such a broadbased liar we all know when trump was president
trump lied about nothing
stop all foreign aid and close the border fjb
all i can do is laugh how can anyone consider voting for biden
the fact that biden is still trying to run for president is beyond logic
why hes keeping saying number one number two its so annoying
bidens administration get personal through the ear buds thats low and seem so desperate to people like me who can actually read people they use 1 2 and 3 so he dont get confused with what they telling him to say
biden doesnt blink too much when the camera changes between trump and him
you know i think they made the debate this way in order to be able to silence each candidate before they got the chance to put too much information out there to the public
old beast racist voice
even the pakman struggling to twist this
this is concerning both of them are not competent to be president
not only waa biden feeble but he lied nonstop
they think were stupid yes they think both of yall stupid
battle of the clones
joe dont speak anymore
watching biden lie is like watching my toddler try to lie only my 3 year old isnt in charge of the country so its not so cute with biden
someone is talking to biden and telling him what to say with an ear bud
if you listen too this at 2 times speed they both seem normal
trump can only talk about borders everything goes to the border he sucks
we hope for help for my familywe need you a lot
trump shouldnt be president he should be a witty remarks tutor
ive never heard 81 million people be so quiet
inflation is beyond up 20 its more like 210
biden is not fit to continue as potos having said that his opponent is a convicted felon and shouldnt be allowed to run to succeed the current presidentthese two are a major embarresment to the country of usa period
i mean honestly the difference between them is shocking its cruel and sick that joes disgusting 2nd wife would support him doing this and keep egging it on
trump always talks about the last topic when a new question is asked
why does sleepy joe say everything twice i think he forgets he said it already
imagine thousands of innocent men women and children are being killed as we speak because of joke politicians like these two what an irony
im a bit emotional hearing biden he sounds so old its okay joe you been here since 07 thank you retire rest
how did the us come up to this a choice between the worst trump is evading each question trhowm at him i feel like he is just unable to answer those questions and biden is just too old to run for presidency he should rest power is a very attractive thing
who else is here cuz theyre dad didnt help them out
not debate with no audience muted mics etc just an insipid show more proof bidens state
you a disaster joe nyc cops getting killed again daily why
luuuuub me some president trumpbiden is melting every answerbiden isnt andwering anythinghe keeps goimg back to provenfakestorieshahahah trump
they took your job
we used to have 99 cent mcchickens and 24 hour walmarts enough said trump 24
every time biden got stuck or froze all i could think of there is a reported internet outage in your area
this is a parody
i noticed that biden gave many data examples it is a good thing all trump does is just blaming immigrants
i could do without the back and forth of pointing fingers just answer the dadgum questionsif u can unfortunately biden can not
i came here for bidens mistakes and hilarious facial expressions
im so glad cnn covered this so their viewers finally can see what their news channel has been hiding from them these last 4 years now they know
cnn should be ashamed betting on biden
when i see this and then the comments that follow im still baffled that biden has ppl at his rallies that arent paid seriously this is insane so who will be up for the dems president elect surely not sleepy joe
it seems that trump blames everything on immigrants
joe the idea biden he mustve said it about 150 times the other thing he kept doing was running off numbered lists all scripted to a very poor memory
if debating was a special olympics event biden would take the gold
american should care for biden should let him take rest age matter sometimes
they must not have fully charged bidens battery before this he almost powered down a few times
drama and frills asidetrumps an irratic child on ground he is crazy scary for a big country like usa he has no idea what hes doingissue always in politics is people generally watch it just like a movie i hope everything happens for the greater good a strong america is in favor of the whole world
had a apt once upon a time guy in red tie gave us new windowsand new blacktop guy in blue tie cut the water in the drinking fountainslet the grass grow knee high 3 office managers later i moved out to a red state with a place that runs it properly unlike blue crumbling states banana republic
bidens wife should be put in jail for elder abuse
amazing what 10 days at camp david can do
with a population of 300 million this is the best you can offer
11334 listen carefully
1145 biden is lucky his pause didnt last another 34 seconds it was 15 seconds of nonsense as it was
it honestly sounds like two toddlers fighting im ngl these are the leaders of our country
please play the golf match
best regards excellent presidents the market leads costs and prices above a digital and physical market aimed at commoditization so how to make a difference looking everywhere observing opening previously unexplored paths with discipline creating happy people rivals separate people friends shake hands and work together not separately but for good and human development thank you for the opportunity i am a social manager with studies in the topic and volunteer work always at your service
bad grandpa is lost in the sauce the economy is absolutely tanking i talk to dozens a people everyday a lot of them in the constructionhousing business all of them are desperate for work right now they are not selling houses some are still being built but it is coming to a standstill meanwhile a house here in southwest florida was about 350k in 2020 pre pandemic now the same houses are over 750k more than double groceries are probably 80100 more expensive not 20 like the media portrayed the media is just buying their time to reveal the true data of the economy this will be sometime in janfeb of 2025 after the election
the whitehouse has become a retirement village
200 millions for ukraine zelensky and the oligarchs are buying mansions and land in switzerland cypress and luxemburg refugee ukrainians making holidays in their own land with the money they receive
that was the end or beginning of this year trump is not president
biden blames trump for children in cages but obama and biden built the cages he doesnt remember
is that why africa doesnt want to have anything to do with our money or trade with the us
forget child care whos the best president
trump answered jan 6 question very well
let this be a lesson to all you can truly accomplish whatever dream you have you can have dementia and be president in america anything is possible
poor biden cant even talk straight or at all shid i can barely hear him
we the peopledeclare our imdependencekennedy24
how come american presidents are never smart
is it normal for candidates to ignore the moderators questions like im young and this is the first presidential debate ive watched but i thought the point was to publicize your answer to the questions youre asked not ignore them
trump is a buisness man he knows what hes doing
heh my fav exchange was trump saying cmon joe lets not act like children and biden immediately snapping back with you are a child in the most proving the point way one could hope for
the jobs he created went to the migrants
cnn notes are not allowed during the debate camera immediately pans and show biden with lots of papers in front of him what a joke
good grief i felt like i was watching my 13 and 8 yr old explain why its the other ones fault just tell me you are lowering cost of living and making the benefits of having a job more appealing childcare is too expensive so staying home without a job is more lucrative keep our borders secure pay the cops pay the teachers be a decent human
it is insane that jb thinks we are so stupid hey joe we have been here the whole time and we know our everyday living has gone to outrageous prices we also know everything you said came from your ear peice what a joke
no one is killing babies after birth who believes that
whats the michael scott quote sometimes i start a sentence and i dont even know where its going something like that lol
what is it with biden number 1 number 2 i never hear him get to three oh he did get to three
wow 12 to 13 minutes in and biden just goes into cognitive decline
toss bucket combo
a vote for biden is a lose
he frl has troops dying biden is lying he sending troops to ukraine they dying bro
costed me 8 for a bus ticket for one trip inflation is killing me
i had to stop watching the cnn version because they had comments turned off i support freedom of speech
more quality memes were done under my administration
i made a collage photo of biden at the debate vs him here oh how i wish i could load a photo here to the comments either they are using like 20 filters or this is a dupe wearing a mask sadly nothing will erase what i saw during the debate i feel sad for him getting older does suck he should step down and enjoy retirement i meant to post this on his address from today
biden if im elected im going to restore roe v wade i guess he forgot he was president for the past 3 12 years and did nothing well at least he admitted we finally beat medicare
2058 2105 excuse me joebama when you were vp under obummer it was his administration that you were part of that put them in those cages
it doesnt matter how much biden stutters i will take him over liar trump hes lying
groceries increased from 100 in 2019 to 120 in 2024 is that moderator high try 300 minimum
id be amazed if the democrats allowed a second debate this was an execution
i have read biden did badly
i think joe is ready to retire but his family members are not ready to give up the gravy train and the private jets lifestyles
joe really is delusional
save yourself time trump won hands down clear concise presidential
20532057 border patrol endorsed biden i dont think so i dont believe they wanted the daily nightmare theyre dealing with today
trump speaks the truth america is an embarrassment and completely broke thanks to the liberal democrats how about letting state handle abortions as they always have trump 2024
inflation is killing all americans its not a race thing
feels like both of em heard whatever they felt like for the most part when they asked about american addiction
trump was accused of building a wall to keep other bad people outside of the us now our borders are open and we are being invaded trump is not president
this was the nail in the coffin for biden gg time for a retirement home
the fact that these are the 2 we have running for president shows how weak and embarrassing america is
voters why wont abc cbs nbc pbs and all media let the voters listen to the hur tapes
thats treason
lets get 2 gas back in the office
woke idealogy is destroying america as we know it without trump america is history
if people vote for biden my question is why he has a poor performance he too old for the job and higher prices like gas house rents and more
russia didnt invade ukraine and hamas didnt attack israel until after biden was president for months
im not very political but this is interesting
the trumpinator
one of these presidents in hospice
this is too close to idiocracy 2006
a liar vs a bumbling old man great
biden not fit to be president pure and simple
god bless you my president donald trump 2024
19481955 fiftyone years of a bad decision it should have been left to the states to decide through the vote of the people the supreme court of the united states put it back to the states subject to the vote of the people thus overturning roe v wade
weapons not money well lets follow the money
democrats shouldnt be surprised all of us shouldnt be surprised how biden did hes such a geriatric mess while trump is looking so alert focused its like night day
the idea that bafmuffmah fummuh uh uhbuh buh uhhhhm ridiculous
does biden think we cant remember what happened his first day when he proudly signed all those executive orders that screwed us from the very first day i guess we are all supposed to play stupid he sucks
what is with our current president and all these childish elementary school level ad hominem attacks
18321835 the politicians are making these decisions no its we the people joebama well at least in other parts of the country not sure about commiefornia which is run by gruesome newsom
ok 3037 this is where im just like please biden go home live your old days with your family and give this up please blink two times if they are forcing you
trump knows he will beat biden by using his powerful tactic that is to make biden gets very angry it works when joe gets angry he tents frees having a hard time to breath and talk joe needs to be more selfcontrol for the next debte or he will have a heart attack
these idiots talking about golf
benjamin netanyahu should be our president because thats who they biden and trump get there orders from anyway and thats the reason why no one respects us anymore
15341538 california under gavin gruesome newsom signed into law the ability for a newborn infant to be killed up to 28 days after the childs birth without any civil or criminal penalties or consequences of any kind what mr trump is saying about democraticrun states like california commiefornia is true
we definitely need this inflation to go down i have a hard time affording food and i remember in bidens first year of presidency that they started printing money news barely covered it but anyone that has taken a college economics class actually a beginner one should know that causes inflation i wont even get started about the border they were worried we didnt have enough hard workers and let free reign come across this new generation doesnt know how to work and some of their parents dont im 29 from a family of famers and think everyone wants happiness but doesnt want to work for it theres a slang term for todays new generation that i think is very valid they are turning into weakness and complainers i have to roll with the punches and receive no help not that i dont want it but thats how the cookie crumbles and i think a lot of americans are going into despair because they dont have pride work ethic or respect 3 jobs to stay afloat 1 job when trump was president things were better covid was terrible and it seemed like the president was trying to avoid panic which all should im so glad bidens incompetency was shown in this debate get him off the stage wait they did and he needed help
im surprised nobody mentioned that shortly after the october 7th attacks joe biden antony blinken made a trip not to israel but to iran the sponsor of the attacks they went to iran to allow the transfer of 6 billion in frozen iranian funds from south korea to qatar without the threat of us sanctions the exact date of their trip september 11th 2023 911 if you think im making this up i urge you to look it up and see for yourself that its true understand that the force that attacked israel is an iranian proxy in other words they share interests with iran and would not exist without the funding provided by iran furthermore after us seals took out the terror cell responsible for the 911 attack on the us iran allowed experienced refugees to flee iran and rebuild that terror cell simply on the basis of mutual antius goals once youve verified all this information yourself let it marinate picture the us as your family israel as your neighbor and friend and iran as an enemy neighbor a neighbor who celebrated the attack on your family and who literally funded the recent attacks on your friends family imagine if that attack on your friendly neighbor was just a couple weeks ago and today is the anniversary of the attack on your own home what would you think if today you saw a member of your household sneak out of your house pass up your friends house walk to your enemys doorstep and write them a check just seriously marinate on that for a bit
when is biden going to apologize to trump
as an non american im soo sorry guys
711 questionnaire ate lol you can do whatever you want to with the minute we give you
i feel like everytime biden talks his last brain cell is like nah fam im gonna sit this one out
i had two chances to vote for trump and didntnow its a very serious possibility
wordsmith vs old fart its so sad that we have these 2 as our choices and this panel as the moderators
amazing ly bad on all fronts
best comedy ever
can i get a tax credit for being white and productive
biden deserves this after lying about being the uniter more like divider in chief i dont have any pity for him or the ones behind the curtains that will have their fate judged in the end where their power means nothing
biden i cant think of any world leader who wouldnt trade places with me yeah cuz you cant think
what a freak show
have to choose between buffoon and senile murica you are in trouble
obama made the cages
watching how biden goes after him for covid shows they created the covid pandemic just to destroy trump
why are there programs to help black people buy homes why is there moneys available for black peoples child care why not white people
i watched this cause i was in the mood for a comedy
voting for new president is like in a 2 rooms there is full of snakes and crocodiles which room us citizens will choose to go i guess many citizens will not vote this year it will become a history for the lowest votes recorded
trump 2024 hes the man
this is crazy
you and your cronies did steal the 2020 election joe
take a drink every time biden says the idea
grocery bills going up 20 i wish
age 1329 democrat who just believes the world could be a better place age 30 immediately republican because you realise you cant fix the world with wishful thinking
hear say 4 star said it omg comedy central deluxe
at least they are good at golf so they say
remember when we use to make fun of trump cause how he talk it age like a milk
biden already try to stop food stamps some ppl need them
btw always respect your elders just dont let them run the only country on earthfreewith the one true godonly god
throw biden out
nato does nothing for us just takes our money
you have to wonder how biden got in the first time how tf is this man currently president this is embarrassing
good lord how is that guy able to stand for an hour and a half they pumped him up with the good stuff
biden holy fk new world order is really planing someting new by leting biden lose this election
horrible job for the moderators letting trump lied all the time and never answered the question horrible job
i love how biden is always looking to someone to help him
trump 20202024 fjb
god bless our elderly including joe biden hes just and i say just leniently a politician not talking about his crackhead son or his house in delaware lets hope trump wins
they have him so incredibly high yet he still cant focus fully also why is a moderator doing followups tor biden when he forgets something
that sure wasnt to hard for trump lol
at this point i feel like just about anybody would be a better presidential candidate for us
every time biden opens his mouth he just makes a random accusation of trump that could be disproven with a simple internet search this kinda forked tongued politician is exactly why americans have very low trust in their elected officials
im really glad tump is no longer orange
its almost like watching a evangelical try and explain thats right and wrong hahha
this isnt the whole thing where the part where biden has to be hand lead off the stage to not get lost or fall
341814558 people in the good old usa and these are the two best politicians your country has to offer
hillary obama and the big donars the inner circle there were lots of stupid people involved in how the democratic party is now if you were an investor would you buy if you were a board memeber you would be shunned and stomped out thats the biz they are in
donald trump we love you you are a great man and god will fight this fight for you
biden was not president in the beginning of covid he took over 2022 we were almost out of the woods
no studio audience fjb sadly diaper joe had the questions prior to the debate and still proved himself to be incompetent side note did president trump call him brandon
why does biden have to lie on top of a lie and every time he talks he makes a ridiculous story that never happened about himself and his family
laurel and hardy show

is this even a debate anymore it has more in common with a roast session
no joe its not americas job to protect the world and it needs to stop
yes our inflation is up because someone printed a ton of money and gave everyone a check the more of anything causes things to be worthless to explain you have devalued money
bidens facial expressions are hilarious
so much for the rules and shutting mics off when its the others turn
biden is weak and so loose to be the president of america
10530 i watched the whole things and right here where he says by the way and not finishing shows all you need to know
i cannot stand listening to bidens locked up voice for more than 2 seconds
from what once was the greatest economy in the world this is the worst debate ive ever heard two children blaming one another
the federal government has too much power give it back to the states
trump wins 88
while pres trump is speaking it appears that the most popular president ever is busy looking at a laser pointer on a wall
ukraines not in the usa joe maybe if you werent sending all our money is getting sent over there and nothing is guaranteed back they aint even in nato
what are black jobs
why did the moderators bother asking any questions these two fools didnt answer one and the other two fools didnt pull them up on that america is in so much trouble and therefore so are we solutions anyone
i hate to say it but trump is eating him up
how did he raise the national debt by sending billions of our tax money to other countries oh waitlol our tax money belongs in our country and nowhere else otherwise it is governmental theft
so he basically says he opened the border because he wanted a better economy and that was a way of doing so he needs to be in jail
is biden 81 or 181 i cant remember
hmmm im kinda waiting for biden to yell i know you are but what am iiii
god bless our elderly including joe biden hes just and i say just leniently a politician not talking about his crackhead son or his house in delaware lets hope trump wins
4 years of open flame grilling we are gonna be cooked inside out the upcoming years are going to be eventful to say the least
in bidens defense gas is only 349 in the middle of the summer ohio normally people are screaming about the price of gas not during bidens presidency stillawin biden2024
lets choose freedom trump 2024 make america great again
i spend 100 to fill 2 paper bags with groceries
this isnt a debate this is a geriatric slaughter and elder abuse the lesser of two evils is still trump at least he is intelligible and coherent while biden looks like a he was pulled out a retirement home and he is staring off into space
till they want power
moderator brought up a real concern w this country over ten times the people die yearly last decade compared with many decades before and there is only one reason people cannot get medicine from pharmacys that wont kill you and have had to buy what is smuggled into this country and this is either being hidden from even presidents and those responsible will hurt whoever to get their way too many are dieing and this is the only reason
where the fact checkers at somebody get rachel maddow here get these debates together
remember all the haterisms ppl spewed about obama well have fun picking between these two bozos
so what about childcare
could anyone just once actually answer the original question and not be asked what do you think about blah blah and they respond with well he said this so let me ignore everything you asked and go back three questionsstatements ago and say nuhuh
they are both clowns of a broken political system that would rather bicker then find and implement solutions to serious problems that are jeopardizing americans idk feel like rfk is better then these 2 jokers by leaps and bounds and yet all big stream media blocks him from entering into debates because hes an independent
how is it on the president that blacks are incarcerated and poor its on the blacks
dont forget sss is not the gouvernement money is us money the gouvernement cannot thistub them
why does biden have to say that is a lie every time
biden is a joke i was hoping the moderators wouldve asked the question what is one thing you respect about the other
unfortunately no real information policies or issues discussed through this debate ill keep checking their sites im voting for biden regardless simply for the fact that he is a good man who actually cares about people more people involved in politics will definitely help in the future biden2024 gogreen
joe you cant be a school manager even omg
trump talking about his presidency vs bidens biden everything he said is a lie proceeds to stumble every other word in that sentence
what is he talking about the biden
people retire at the age of 5055 in oversea countries to give way to younger people to establish their career we have an 80s year old president suffering from dementia trying to lead out of a turbulent economyits time the government set an age limit to supreme court justices and to people in congress
just let trump back in office now please this is a painful watch
yeah im voting for trump
this is such a shame of a debate its just biden making accusations of trump about things he himself has done or making claims about what has happened that either arent supported by evidence or at minimum he fails to offer up that evidence if it exists its damned difficult to listen to this old geriatric when hes talking about how he did nothing wrong in afganistans withdraw that resulted in the deaths capture and brutalization of hundreds of thousands of our allies that we just abandoned unceremoniously and then he wants to claim all veterans support him which the ones you were too busy checking your watch to pay attention to on their final trip home
biden is the saddest political joke ive ever heard of
this is something else
this is a crying shame old joe is sickening go president trump
people said he didnt answer the questions yes he did
the shameful left continues to spew tired old fully debunked lies and the big lie they really hang onto and push push push is the one about how biden inherited a huge mess economically and on the border concerning the economy covid is what killed the amazing trump economy all biden has done is preside over the amazing american people bouncing back after covid the lies about the border just amaze me everyone in the whole world knows the border was secure under trump while biden came in and wrote something like 83 eos meant to undo what trump had done for our border then biden sits back and says the border is under control even while they process the illegals by the thousands everyday unbelievable
biden will lose 2024 election
i rather live in a sovereign country with an elected president than to be ruled by a group demented narcissists dictating what we can and cannot do trump 2024
there laying
joe biden just doomed his shot at the election in 90 minutes howard dean did it in a half a second 20 years ago 90 minutes is far more painful than a half a seconds
usa had the most death during covid
trump cannot get into office fast enough
i think biden has been one of the worst presidents in american history so much uncertainty fear and inflation through the roof
5908 thousands of millions cmon bro thats not a number
biden the only terrorist that came through is the one killed 3 under his administration killed auuugh under his administration killed 3 people thats the only terrorist ashhhaii im not saying that no terrorists came through he lies then immediately tries to fix his lies
trump wipe the floor with biden i feel bad for biden hey joe go get a ice cream cone youll be okay
the rest of the world is doomed its like watching an episode of the muppet show
he sounds like an old man on a deathbed my friend said this
okthat 90s show just peaked my intrest
nato is a model for one world order i rather live in a sovereign country and not answer to undercover nazi countries one world order plans to enslave sovereign nations
watch biden closely again he is playing with something in his ear did he have an earpiece in with someone telling him what to say no wonder he was screaming we all already knew joe has severe dementia videos all over the internet of his cognitive decline earpieces were not supposed to be allowed and whats with him reading off that paper was someone in his ear telling him what number response to read watch this again
my english is week or i really dont understand what does biden says
everyone that doesnt know the real value of a dollar can and many do get hurt confusion about the value enables scammers to rob people much easier
one was campaigning and one didnt know what planet hes on theyre both not well spoken and this was not an intellectual debate
why does he make those faces though im sorry im trying not to laugh but i cant help it
allll jokes aside guys they both have valid points on each other
biden is so false when he pretends to be laughing at trump hes disgusting
trump is asked a question and hes busy redirecting by taking jabs at biden rather than answering the questions asked
biden will lie his way to his grave
the idea that biden says thee idea is an idea of the idea of his next presidency ideally lol trump2024
the idea that biden says thee idea is an idea of the idea of his next presidency ideally lol trump2024
biden every time he wasnt speaking
in our country is the social security wiped out economic power wiped out also thanks to the current german government and its still continue the wiping out the world has never seen such incompetent ministers here in germany
after watching this debate snl really needs to make a parody for this just like the previous one
i was trying to help put my dad in law on disability the man could barely walk had a deadly infection in his foot couldnt work or anything and they denied him a few days b4 he passed away so family had to pay out of pocket just to get him buried its terrible
i am a korean what the f happening in america
if they would of told me back in 2000 were gonna have a presidential debate in 2024 with a convicted felon and a man with dementia i would of been like you smoking that good dope
biden used the phrase the idea about 150 times
america is a laughing stock to the whole world biden needs to go home and be taken care of what a shame i have never seen a debate like this jill biden should put an end to her poor husbands suffering and take him out of the white house i feel for biden
does anyone take brandon seriously id love to know
yes our country had been the best country in the world until you biden got elected thats why biden has to go trump 2024
what we saw at the debate was not a bad night as many liberals described it to the contrary it was his best foot forward they finally saw a realistic picture of the guy they voted for without the liberal medias filters gaslighting and censorship
who is going to stand up for the rights of americans and not be bullied in to taking part of them away with bs from the next so called whatescare
biden is concerningly obsessed with instituting racist policies no talk of hispanic or asian families why always black vs white much more complicated topic than presented
no biden didnt fire mayorkas garland because they have been bought and sold to the cartels
this debate is like that sidelook meme all over everytime trump is talking
or choice
the us has an estimated population of 341 million people somehow these 2trump at 78 years old biden at 81 years old are somehow the best candidates to run it really
you cbt just play it and let us make a concern
you got them killedthirteen soldiers got killed under your watch you bad person
does anyone really believe that trump doesnt want to protect our seniors and our vets if you do youve been brainwashed trump is a very compassionate man
biden was flustered by cornpop
yall is this the best we can come up with joe cant finish a sentence clearly and trump wants to deflect lord have mercy
idk why people dont seem understanding biden i can clearly hear what he be saying i guess people are not paying attention or had bad earing
anybody who believes on trump is a fanatic
why does joe biden start sleeping constantly through the debate
no more trump in 2024 no more immoral scammer lier president
as chinese im so glad to see that this is actually funny and the future of us are under their hands
abortion is murder
president trump debated like a man of ethics honor truthful decent intelligent brilliant truth makes one fearless a lion
trump 2024 love from serbia
follow me
this is scary
trump is obviously a lierdo not fool the american people
thanks for nothing cnn you blew it you didnt hold trumps feet to the fire for lying and you are going to focus on bidens cognitive lapses to look evenhanded speaking of failing the debate looks weak to me pick a side our democracy is hanging in the balance i know you know this back your guy its too late to change delusional to think otherwise
vitamins energy stamina focus factor coleslaw beet juice water
both are bad trump and biden needs to answer the questions this is so painful
did anyone in all seriousness truly understand what his plans or intentions are or better yet does anyone feel comfortable leaving their country in his hands after this
biden behaved like a disgusting douce moreover no honor no ethics no decency untruthfull no intelligence
im from poland and what will happen to bellarus bellarus is already with russia for many many years this biden doesnt know history and politics at all what is he talking about
talk about rude hosts you never cut off the president of the us the way you kept doing 51 yes as a senator and the manchurian candidate still sounds like a sniveling rattletake no wonder you guys had to rig the election i think president trump shouldve told the sleepers all that joe has done we the people deserved to have had this spotlight moment telling all the corruption and trafficking biden is involved in gear up folksthe movie is getting ready for the end whenyouknowyouknow
btw this is a terrible excuse for a debate the people who are reporting on it know it all the debates over many years have been a joke its insulting to me as a citizen and im not even a highly educated or wellreared one
sleepy joe is a replica of king of white walker in game of throne lol
please trump save america and the world
this is the most disgusting censorship to remove public involvement by removing an audience the bias of microphone silencing and cutting off answers to disguise feebleness im despise this format more than the candidates being forced on us
cnn is pro trump there is such a bias trump keeps going off on bs arguments then biden needs to take in the rediculous stuff hes hearing from trump
they both should retire
those politicians that left trump like pense are rinos they are in debt to some corrupt politician like you they are incompetent
funny how not one magat can point to any president biden policy that caused inflation what the arp so if the arp caused inflation why was there 50 year inflation highs all through europe did arp pass in europe the inflation rate increased globally w parallel trends due to pandemics impact on the supply chain and was going to happen regardless of who was president corporations have exacerbated inflation with price gouging the us has best post pandemic recovery on the planet too many blindly bleating rw lies need to think critically and thank president biden for being a great president
just one more thing the scary thing is my grand kids may not grow up because this guy as access to the n codes but does not have access to common sense
biden sounds like a scratched compact disk
i just wish they would answer the question hes the worst im the best back and forth
1100 joebama has that deerintheheadlights or that oh i got caught in a lie look on his face
get rid of both of them trump attacked america on jan 6th and you just let him run for president why
yeah biden totally doesnt have someone telling him exactly what to say as he turns up his ear piece at 11043
we havent forgot how great the economy was like when president trump was president
most amazing president in the history of our country 1 president reagan 2 president trump
nothing like watching two old white men fight
so terrifying listening to biden talk is like listening to an unrefined version of fidel theres a reason why most cubans dont like biden same ideas same concepts god save us all and god save america
nato is a model for a much more aggresive union of countries each country should have a choice wether to be part of nato or not the purpose of the new world order is to irradicate the sovereignity of free nations
how many times are the dems going to make the wealthy pay their fair share
imagine if jfk were alive to see this
heres the thing we have to choose one you would really choose sleepy joe i dont think so
i was homeless for some years here i ride the bus and there are so many illegals here its not even funny i got myself off the streets but get very little help
two faces for the same zionist coin
trump was talking about how a 12 year old girl was killed by a migrant and biden literally says everything you just said was a lie i hope the mom of that girl wasnt watching when he said that horrible
soups sandwiches fish tacos burritos burgers ice tea water chillie beans salads
biden did surprisingly well now that i watched the whole debate by myself despite that trump is still the guy that the world needs right now to put a stop to the ww3 that we are in now trump is a prolife he will make ucrainian live a life again gaza at peace biden will never do those
stop child abuse world wide nation wide i see saving orphans save american jobs for the love of god
wonder why they didnt bring up the fact food is being tampered with
1835 biden lied again either that or hes that badly confused mr trump never said that at all go back and review what mr trump said joebama
talking about who is a better golfer both of these guys are completely unsuitable for the presidency
its nice to see biden in bad shape after all the wars he supported and the yearslongcrises he unnecessarily dragged his own people into sweet taste
this debate is a sad indictment on the decline of the united states you just know it is really the cia or something running the country it cant be this guy
im concerned about how many times he is talking about black families and not all americans it sounds like hes just trying to aim at one community im also concerned about his inability to hold a sentence i feel like he may even have a screen in front of him telling him what to say but he still cant get it right he needs to remember anyone with a computer can look up the numbers that he is speaking of as well do we not have any better candidates
all the luck to president donald you made us god bless
if anything was set up to favor bidenthis was it he still failed trump didnt try to take a bunch of one liner jabs nor did he try to go for the jugular when biden flubbed up this doesnt look like the tweet fest trump so many came to abhor from both sides of the aisle i actually think trump truly felt sorry for biden considering his feeble state
there is no audience joe stop saying the audience
looks like the next debate is a gulf tournament the winner becomes the president of the usa
lets go president donald trump
trump 2024 time to drain the swamp
go mega president donald trump
why does it look like trump is not really there yes it shows them there together but it looks like hes in a green screen or like hes being filmed in
we like to welcome our viewers in the united states and around the world so embarrassing the question that should be on everyones mind is who is running this country
i bet cnn hasnt had these ratings in 4 years probably never have again
both biden and trump are unfit for office they are out of date and out of touch with truth and reality biden is simply due for retirement and trump is a pathological liar also due for retirement are these two the best the usa can do americans have no choice but not to vote
this is nasty its not a debate these guys have so much disrespect towards each other and are not trying to hide it whats also obvious is that one is way mentally weaker than the other
why no one ask biden what is ur favorite ice cream flavor
hail king president donald trump
howre all of you still red vs blue we need to start over
wow cant believe the comments are actually working for ounce you can read how people in this crushing economy actually feel about brandon
i hope the rest of america is listening to sleepy joes lies that hes literally taken credit for trumps actions the writing on the wall people inflation has been ridiculous since joes been in office
if joe thinks he smells burning toast call 9eleven
trump saying its not a debate hes the worst president really shows what these two think a presidential debate is supposed to be
my 6 and 8 year old arguesdebates with reason and purpose what in the minion
just look at bidens eyes do you really think hes sober
you can see the difference in whos the stronger president just by looking at the shot at 1214 1223 trump head poised high and biden already staring downwards like hes submissive and cant bounce back from the mistake he made previously in his speech we dont need a defeated president both are terrible options but id rather trump then biden someone who doesnt get used and does things with intentions and not just because people tell him to and if biden gets elected id be crazy if he passed or was unfit and they have kamala harris as the step up sorry not sorry but america has gone down hill and its sad to see
biden is running a smear campaign on trump trump is based in facts and reality and provable numbers
they really arguing about golf were screwed
why do i feel like biden is a political plant who is really running the country
the illegals pouring across the border is on video months and months of video officials pleading with the biden administration for border control and secruity and safety literally months of interviews and videos proving joe is a liar
just did an electoral map based on current polls and trump crushes biden
horrible what biden has done to america
100 groceries are 250 easy
when grandpa is on the peruvian flake
biden is a liar
somebody needs to tell jake tapper that the united states is a constitutional republic and that anybody thinking we are a democracy is either corrupt or ignorant either way they shouldnt be a moderator
a lot of mud slinging going on here biden doing it more the trump which is surprising it really takes away from what i really want to hear about which is concrete plans to restore a whole bunch of things in us policy health care is unaffordable for most education is not anywhere near effective and certainly not globally competitive women need options for pregnancy we need to feel safe both here and from factions abroad infrastructure is still as awful as its been and we need to curb inflation getting things straight with trade and our borders these and many other things are just percolating with these guys focused on character issues biden is feeble barely able to keep on track on top of it all
is this a joke how old is this man my grandpa is 89 now and working another 4 years is just not possible the last 3 years everything went down so fast insane
theres no way biden wins this if he does i suggest all of you salute america goodbye its not gonna last for four more years with someone who cant complete one single sentence without stuttering
12418 never buuu i havijamihagfs strong statement by the us president
heres the deal this country is counting on ya
number 1 2 3 still i cant comprehend
there is no way the democrats can win if biden doesnt step down as the candidate no chance
the idea
biden has a presentation problem but we all know that the country is run by each partys machine in congress and the cabinant we cant possibly expect for biden to make decisions that will actually matter point in fact it is time for the wealthiest of our society to pay for the privilege of free economy to the extent that the needs of the retired and medically venurerable are taken care of republicans only stand for rich getting richer
anyone else get the feeling that you could run for president and win after watching this how did our country nominate these clowns i think something is seriously wrong with the system in place for how we vote for candidates
2100 biden is not telling the truth about the border he has caused a massive flood of illegal aliens coming in unchecked and unvetted some with explosives weapons and maps of where to go and what to do how many of them are probably ccp isis sleeper cells for islamic jihad other undercover agents working for our enemies that want to destroy this nation fugitives from other countries that have come to commit horrendous crimes against we the people i shudder to think of this
we still do not know what they would do for the rise in child healthcare
bidens meds wore off at 1200 mins
biden needs to retired
following bidens incoherent babbling was so pointless in the end all i picked up when he was speaking was the number of times he finished a point by saying number 1 to the point it grinds my gears as well as being incompetent corrupt and just straight up senile hes just all round annoying
why doesnt trump say that there is no way putin would attack natohe just doesnt want nato in his doorstep
typical biden wants to tax the rich yes the rich that have aquire their wealth legally but of course his request will not apply to the corrupt biden admin
biden is having a stroke trying to talk go to bed sleepy joe
pov from europe is that both your possible representatives seem even more embarrassing than the ones we have serious question for democrats and republicans alike not to discredit any presidential performance but how come these guys are your most charismatic intelligent leadershipcompetent candidates werent you the guys that tried to show the world the future
america is in a crisis due to evil people flooding the states
jb is such a joke
are these my only choices
love our president trump hes a fearless man biden is demented and a great deceiver hes gone nuts
trump speaks biden answers its a lie
biden ismis quoting disinformationing straight out lying joebiden is a despicable joke
smh trump has no proof about anything he says joe biden looks sick
both are war criminal
biden also looks as if he has a earpiece in his left ear it is in the last 20 minutes biden gets frustrated and mad looks all the way to his right expand and enlarge i think when he gets lost they tell him where to look down on his sheet of paper probably numbers
the side effects of covid vaccine can be seen in joe
watching from scotland good luck america need too get rid of biden quick
trump probably sleeps hangs upside down blurs the lines of truth with a straight face
trump for the future of the world biden is a disgrace to america sadly those of us in the rest of the world that have to live with the weakest allowed by the american people god help us all
my prayers and thoughts go out to president biden and former president trump
joe cant stop lying about literally everything theres numbers and facts disproving the things he says
biden is just lost and trump is to busy tooting his own horn
both suck matter of fact all politicians suck its all some sick joke at this point
we have a thousand trillionares in america lol
why is it up to anyone else but the one person it is effecting
a criminal to the left of you and demented puppet to the right of you hmmm how to choose
abortion is and should of always been upntonthe woman her body her future her choice second please please someone who can not only complete a thought but also not have any ilegal issues going on either personal or by family why cant we just have 2 normal ppl to run the country
funny how they say no notes allowed while biden clearly keeps looking down at his notes
the real criminals are the politicians evil
am i the only one who needed to turn on subtitles when sleepy joe is speaking
god help us
this is actually media power
america you are in so much trouble if these two are your only choices this whole debate was embarrassing to your country
