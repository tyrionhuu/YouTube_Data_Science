many people assume the democratic party champions civil rights but history tells a different story since its inception in 1829 the democratic party has a troubling legacy of opposing major civil rights advancements it defended slavery instigated the civil war and resisted reconstruction efforts the party founded the ku klux klan enforced segregation and obstructed civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s conversely the republican party emerged in 1854 as an antislavery movement its founding mission aimed to halt slaverys expansion and eventually abolish it this stance faced setbacks notably the 1857 dred scott v sandford case where democraticappointed justices ruled against citizenship for slaves abraham lincoln the first republican president led the nation through the civil war and emancipated the slaves following lincolns assassination by a democrat andrew johnsona democratopposed lincolns plans for integrating freed slaves into society democrats continued to resist constitutional amendments abolishing slavery and granting citizenship and voting rights to blacks amendments passed with overwhelming republican support during reconstruction republicans secured rights for freed slaves electing numerous black representatives to congress however democratic resurgence after reconstruction reintroduced racial oppression through laws like black codes poll taxes and literacy tests enforced through terror tactics by groups like the ku klux klan even president woodrow wilson a democrat supported segregation and promoted racist propaganda decades later significant democratic opposition stalled the civil rights act of 1964 while republicans overwhelmingly supported it overcoming democratic filibusters despite historical injustices democrats shifted strategy seeking black voter allegiance through government assistance programs yet these policies have often perpetuated dependency and harmed black communities weakening families limiting educational opportunities and undermining public safety in assessing the parties roles in advancing racial equality and civil rights understanding this complex history is crucial it challenges the narrative of democratic leadership in civil rights revealing a legacy marked by resistance and failed policies that have impacted black americans profoundlycarol swain,NONE,NONE

very least a graveyard crew of 7 per state maintaining our countrys registry these i wholeheartedly believe key when building upon holding and in keeping a career there should never be despondency if theres an issue should we not be alotted to onthejob training if theres emotional turmoil should we not be alotted onthejob resources if were to be hired initially should we not have job security in every job position then theres border protection which is absolutely imperative key fundamentals of democratic policies like maintaining womens rights my body my choice in her right for an abortion equality in the workspace and full equality in general fighting for our citizens and trying to be the voice for everyone lowering our deficit focusing on climate change in every aspect from agriculture and permaculture to species on the brink of extinction rehabilitation and reassimilation to finding better pesticide and insecticide products that wont harm our critical benign insects like pollinators and seasonal nomadic to stopping any new big oil and gas development agreements working with all our world leaders to create policies best for us as the united states of america but also best for our world globally and so much more i would change so much of our marginalized communities as i can surely stress that its these citizens who take the brunt from every level the disparages of our system can seem unbearable and starting from the bottom all the way to the top one step at a time is how well enact a more equitable society but im still too young vp only we need to come together as the united states of america namely we all must work if weve need supplement of our govt as nationals we must volunteer at the least strictly in maintaining our society every one of us united states of america nationals deserve housing a job and financial aid maintaining one designated building in the heart of every downtown in every city to supply these needs will promote so much growth in such a rough market that we do currently face building upon our democratic leadership that i follow in direct cadence we must focus on police reform criminal reform and in fixing our mental health system building upon from the bottom to the top the middle out focusing on creating jobs in all sectors in semiconductors food processing manufacturing and absolutely focusing on bad banking practices and in fixing these issues in predatory lending triple loans reliance on corporations too big to fail then theres even housing reform 1 deed per citizen and or persons with dependents negotiable not mandatory implementations1 house 1 apartment complex 1 lease 1 corporation 1 entity 1 building highrise simple its clear to see that the real estate market is leading our economy and society without a single thread of oversight and its with shortsighted policies like these that skew misrepresent and shatter the current divide of our current american society immigration reform process and deportation with a negotiable warning or added criminal charges if the subject is already within the system and these undocumented crossings are continuous refugee asylum reform strict background check and applicating process case management oversight with weekly 1 hour appointments mandatory job seeking 3 per appointment governmental subsidies never be granted 10 years supplemental housing never be granted 10 years filibuster reform perfect proposals instrumental acts lifechanging bills imperative amendments that are yielded on the floor with a system in place of votedupon of yeays or nays unless getting at least the simple majority in the house 218435 and concurrently the simple majority in the senate 51100 theyre dead on arrival and the only pressure we have is filibustering eliminating motions that bring bills to the senate floor eliminating filibustering amendments and eliminating the noeffort filibuster would give every senator a voice but not a veto homelessness initiatives 1public loos in every city 2public electrical outlets in every city 3public laborready locales to work for at least 2000day in every city as these basic necessities are not only overlooked but unprovided as it stands whereas public defication is illegal whereas loitering is illegal whereas businesses bar our public from even using their services without exchanges of

double mandatedpayments with massive interest hikes risky mortgages that necessitate paychecktopaycheck 20year payments and these practices benefit mostly these entities while leaving so many of our fellow americans in close to impossible arrears judicial reform when so many massive discrepancies credible unjust lawsuits getting completely swept under the rug with dismissals incredulous taking sides and onesided judgements we need an infrastructure system in place to have oversight over these types of scenarios a much more involved supreme court financial regulatory reform bad banking practices affect our entire nation on nearly all levels from the bottom to the top with a select few able to regulate and it is allencompassing measures to assist our fellow citizens with a risk

question 1 of the debate was about inflation the very first words out of bidens mouth were lies 1 well you got to take a look at what i was left when i became president what mr trump left me fake the condition of the economy was not due to trump but due to the pandemic and due to governors who mandated the closing of businesses in their states he was not responsible for that condition other than to say it would have been worse had he not done the things he did what mr trump left me suggests that what was left was of his doing and it absolutely was not 2 we had an economy that was in free fall lie people were starting to get vaccines in december and things were already rapidly returning to normal by late january things werent falling they were rising 3 the pandemic was so badly handled many people were dying and all he said was its not that serious just inject a little bleach into your arm youll be alright objectivelylie lie lie a the pandemic wasnt mishandled they did try their best supplying the cdc with the resources to do its work doctors not politicians lead the response if social distancing and masking were not effective i wouldnt blame the administration or even the medical scientists who were limited in what could be done there was no great silver bullet they missed a great and effective grand thing that would make all the difference it was small things that had small impacts b many people were dying thats true but anything that comes after the statement of all he said would be a deliberate misrepresentation unless it contained all of what he said c the statement he attributed to him was nothing even remotely close to what he said and it wasnt even based on something he said it was based on a question he asked someone while not addressing the press something he found interesting that statement was a complete lie and deliberately misleading anyone who heard it trump never even used the word bleach he did use the word disinfectant a person with a virus is infected to disinfect a person infected with a virus is to inject an antiviral medication a virus killer antivirus is a disinfectant because it comes in contact with a virus and the virus dies antibodies attack infections the therapy monoclonal antibodies used man made proteins that acted like antibodies in that they bound to the virus and destroyed it as they disinfected an infected person and it was an iv injection they actually did inject people with a type of disinfectant 4 the economy collapsed there were no jobs absolutely false businesses couldnt hire because no one wanted to work businesses had to struggle to get staff to return as he was taking office tons of jobs no people 5 the unemployment rate rose to 15 lie he asked us to look at what he left us joe took office late january of 2021 did he not the month of january 2021 had a 63 unemployment rate and was coming down nearly half a percent 4 not as bad as joe states it and improving the rebound had begun the difference between 63 and 15 is huge double the 63 to 126 and you are still way off by thousands and thousands if you wanna say he wanted to say thats how bad it once was he should also give trump credit for getting it from 15 down to 63 but as you listen the intent was to make biden look like he was the one that conquered the 15 unemployment obstacle no he spent trillions taking us from 63 to around 4 his goal was to make his achievement look better than it was next was some pointless words with no claims 6 we created 15000 new jobs i put that face because of his next statement we brought out ahem in a position where we have 800000 new manufacturing jobs false this cant be accurate if you have 800000 new manufacturing jobs how can you have only created 15000 jobs which one is false because we arent that bad at math that we cant see one or both are fake numbers you cant call it truth ps giving government contracts from money the government doesnt have and thus spending tomorrows money now is robbing future tax collections that enlarges the money supply thats how you caused the inflation he actually gave one of the answers to thr question here we created jobs with government money its the people who took these jobs and spent their paychecks buying stuff that caused inflation good luck in getting him to acknowledge they over stimulated the economy and that did it hes probably not smart enough to know that,NONE,NONE
