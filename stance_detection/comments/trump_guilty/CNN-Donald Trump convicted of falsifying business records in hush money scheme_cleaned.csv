i just wanted thank the left for re elected trump dont you ever learn
history will never erase this 34
so do people have blackmail on the judge some of the injustice is caused by hidden crimes like sex with a 9 year old girl
umm what crime did he actually commit
im here for the maga tears ooooooh they are delicious
fantastic save our country vote for biden even is you dont care for him he is the only choice if you want to remove the sanity that is happening in the republican party
trump 2024 ups wrong news channel this is the one that imports democracy from ukraine
it is illegal for donald trump as a convicted felon to posses firearms he can no longer be in control of americas military or weapons he can no longer control the secret service he can no longer control weapons of any kind he can no longer be commander and chief give one year for each felony at mardelargo 19th hole of course
thank you alvin bragg for bringing trump back as president in 2024 maga 2024
technically not unprecedented redcoats made sure every signer of the constitution or voice of independence became a criminal its what tyrants do
if you dont understand this ruling of 34 counts for trump then search up trump rule 34
both trump and biden are using our judicial system as weapons against each other they both need to go and we can hopefully get our country back
dont like trump and have been a democrat for years but this trial was bs yeah yeah hes guilty but what about the millions of dollars coming from china to the bidens without any explanation that doesnt affect us more than this hush money thing dont understand the glee over his conviction and the hate for him either we are accepting too many biased actions because of it wait till its done to someone we like
but yet killary klinton is at home in her mansion drinking blood
trump is a rockefeller op
just curioushow many members of the jury had unnaturally colored hair and referred to themselves with pronouns and made it a point they use said pronouns
its all a charade but not that it matters considering trump is controlled opposition anyway
the wicked are guilty against god you accuse a good man like gods son was accused of false charges your modern day pharisee
hamas was guilty against god
the president of iran was guilty against god
that lady go a teacher kicked out of her seat in the jet and was nasty to kavanugh

we will never let him sit in a cell always remember that im calling on all patriots to take direct action if they attempt it
on behalf of donald trump thank you cnn for the additional 10 million votes
convicted felons lose a lot of rights was the founding fathers original intent for convicted felons to become presidents or even be allowed to run for president i dont think so no one in their right mind can conclude this what will the originalist supreme court think about this issue while each state may have slightly different penalties there are some common rights that are almost always taken away in california convicted felons will lose the following rights voting rights ability to travel abroad gun ownership jury service employment in certain fields public assistance and housing parental rights no one should be above the law not even trump even if the constitution does not ban convicted felons from becoming president with all the principles in the constitution and our laws the only conclusion that follows is that convicted felons are banned from becoming presidents this would had been what the founding fathers had concluded had they come across this issue no reasonable person can conclude otherwise
bet he wont do not even a day in prison just watch
and the communist news network spews again
the zionist lobby pressures trump to fund israel with weapons to kill children in order to get their support in elections they will delete this comment
he breaking records and the gop loves it
wheres melania many people are saying she is planning a divorce is that true
amd you people that think this is good are rhe reason are country is the way it is keep voting for that joke we have in office trump was a good thing for this country you people ruin everything
cnn is such a joke
do you think for a moment that the majority of americans belive the bias liberal media or that the democrats are not just corrupt to the core
is the law for everyone or just for some is he imune just because he was a lousy president
only dishonest people will vote to elect trump again
to those who are willing to listen along time ago there was a man who hated the government he was loved for the way he revolted against those who sat in power by his words and acts he led to many violently atrocities for his nation though the government would rather avoid bloodshed they wished to hold their authority unchallenged so this man brought out the worst in them they would violently harass the peoplewhile looking for him even if people were innocent they would be harassed just for the warning of what would happen if they discovered something about this man eventually the man was captured and sentenced to death but something unexpected happened awhile later there was another who went out to help others he would heal the sick feed the hungry and would help those many believed were beyond help this challenged the government in a different way because now this one wasnt crossing the line they wouldnt cross for evil but was crossing the line they wouldnt regarding helping others the people dragged this one to a judge and seeing that the cause was out of envy the judge gave the people a choice they could either have this one released who had done no wrong or they could have the man that lead to the lands desolation set free but the people would not allow their eyes to be opened so they allowed the man to be sent free and had the healer sentenced to death the one who was set free was given the name barabbas and the one who was sentenced to death was named jesus this is the storm the world faces today for 4 years the one who is condemned now has not been in office and many plead for his judgement and condemnation still and some still love the chaos he caused and want his authority to return so they may reap the benefit of it but very few see that the court room has been recreated again just as it was barabbas and the son of man known as jesus for no one who truly knows the son of man denies his words and he willingly allowed himself to die because he didnt want man to succumb to being unforgiving and merciless beings for any cause for that causes them to decay away many may be healed at this time if they count the cost from where they have fallen and build back up by valuing what they have heal those who are suffering do not commit to violent protests and the actions which follow them forgive without turning off wisdom search for how you may do these things with gentle hearts even though it will be a hard road regardless a gentle pace makes the work easy many say now that it is not as dark as it was during years before because many deaths are not occurring but the amount of unforgiveness is higher now than it has been before and the loss of life is a small result which will come compared to the other consequences the world is facing now leave stories like this alone storms like this will come and they will come again but take each day one step at a time and you will have heard the reason the son of man was willing to die so many may find life even beyond death the way the truth and the light the bread of life the home of love the joy of a child the language of the eternal nation the written words which shall not pass away the building blocks which one may use to unlock the doors where anything is possible the blood of the lamb john 115 genesis 13 genesis 9816 exodus20117 matthew 1 matthew 4 matthew 57 matthew 91017 mark124144 luke 74050 matthew 13 matthew 19 matthew 222346 matthew 2325 matthew 281620 luke 101742 luke 23612 john 753811 john 84859 john 1317 john 3 revelations 11 revelations 16 dont let the apathy of the world cause you to loose hope this is the spirit of the frog where no moment of darkness is worth being thirsty for the love of light and when no moment of light is worth letting go of the darkness one loves to hold onto but the spirit of the son of mans words will heal anyone who is willing to accept them then you are ready to turn the page onward to the last chapter toward a beginning without end revelations 22 those who are trained in the light the entire book is at hand count where you are so you may help yourselves and those who will go with you revelations 122
whoever has not sinned may throw the first stone jesus christ trump is being convicted by people who do the exact same crimes if not worse that he does
i guess the one thing you can say is trump keeps making history
you cnn liberals are completely brainwashed by liberal media we the people have 34 more reasons to vote trump
how did they get a jury of his peers how many ex presidents are alive
i can watch this on repeat every day until his next guilty verdict happens
this should now open the doors for all convicted felons with felonies to vote and run for the presidency of the united states of america if a police officer committed a crime and was convicted of the crime especially a felony is sent to prison and his or her rights to vote are terminated and cant ever be police officers again so why can pinocchio trump the convicted felon be allowed to still be the president of the united states as well as vote why the double standard this should now open a pandoras box for civil rights attorneys to file a class action suit to restore all convicted felons rights to vote as soon as they are released from prison whats good for one then it should be good for others fair is fair we the people are all equal so why one is allowed to still vote and be president but others in his shoes cant qualifications to become president of the united states is that you are 30 years old and up and not a convicted felon like i said a cop cant get his job back in law enforcement if convicted of a felony so how does a ex president have that privilege a convicted felon has no rights by law so trump does civil rights attorneys here is your chance to make history for convicted felons since it seems trump gets a hall pass
ok lets be hones this is all bs why arent they telling us what the hush money was for on all 34 counts where is the evidence behind behind these claims
its a disgrace that someone found guilty of 34 felony charges by a jury of their peers can run for president of the united states and its even more disgraceful that the socalled party of law order and family values supports the criminal trump not 48 hours after the guilty verdict was announced trump and his maga boot lickers were inciting violence again as a former pretrump lifelong republican i will never vote for a republican again i like presidents who dont break the law and shatter the lives of everyone stupid enough to get involved with them voting for my country
should stormy daniels be charged with illegal activities
dont argue with bots
you sure you want to go down the political prosecution road liberals two can play this game if geriatric joe isnt committed to the home first some bribery issues will come up in a republican administration
what might be trumps nickname in the big house
could have said guilty of 34 counts instead of repeating 34 times de same thing omg waste of time
why was trump tried in district court by a district attorney for alleged federal charges
no one is above the law except a democrat amazing how this lawfare is failing trumps poll numbers are going up and joes are going down and trump made 60 million since this verdict and if you dont think that this is all happening with out the approval of joe biden then i got a bridge in arizona to sell you from the front porch you can see the sea too by the way if the judge sentences trump to jail his numbers will sky rocket in popularity see i play baldurs gate and in a part of the game i had to fight this monster and every time i damaged it it got stronger anything the socialist democrats do to trump he only gets stronger one more thing i keep seeing these 34 counts postings it was 1 count broken up into 34 counts its like if you and a friend were smoking a joint and passed it back and forth 20 times and the da charged you with 20 counts of distribution of narcotics
so ive been seeing videos on youtube where black people are saying to other black people that support trump that they arent black how does this even remotely make sense yes there are tons of black people that support trump which obviously proves he is not a racist so i guess there is an agenda after all that a bunch of black peoples refuse to get sucked into and really want a president that puts america first i applaud these people that refused to get sucked into bullshit agendas
i think nikki haley now regrets supporting trump last week
ooohohohohoohhhthis is something new so it means other rich americans dont do that or they are not tried for it until they want to become president
many people dont want trump they want the anticrist
lets say it like it is around 50 of americans are prepared to vote for a 34time convicted criminal as president after all these years no one is surprised that this criminal is a republican no one should be surprised that his mentally backward supporters are primarily potential violent criminals who threaten the judge and the jury and therefore have no understanding of the rule of law or democracy
all i could think about when he counted all these felonies was dj khalid saying annnnd another one another one another one
just stand down trump and stop embarrassing yourself your family country
ha ha little lefties this only makes trump stronger just like raiding mar a lago did indicting him in ga did etc how do you people not see that his polling has jumped and his donations have set records yet you actually think this is helping your cause youre just blind stupid and of course ignorant he will win the white house and goodbye to this ridiculousness hopefully he goes after huge payback too
i do not support trump only because i believe he is part of the bigger globalist plan but this 100 secured his win im getting the fuck out the country asap
a load of bs
fake judges fake courts all across america
you guys should be ashamed of yourselves you guys counted 34 counts of supposedly the same thing falsifying records when he has accountants everything lawyers and what does his businesses have to do with stormy daniels a prostitute nothing
cnn is fake news and is guilty of lying to the american people for decades
i mean these all sound good and all but from every one of these ive looked up and there related charges there all lowest of the low for felonys all thats going to happen is he has to pay a bucket load in fines again only proving the point for the rich payable by fine means legal for a price and even if he does time behind bars he will be well fed kept away from other inmates and given lots and lots of treats and extra stuff for being rich and behind bars with trumps money and fame you mind as well call these 34 misdemeanors because thats how they will be treated
lets assign a fiscal to all people to all saints of new york
justice served
this is not a hush money case this is an election subversion case the orange felon is finally being held accountable for his criminal behavior which means lady justice needs to be praised for holding strong god bless america
who gives a shit make him president again
trump a convicted felon is now a convicted felon i feel obligated to refer to him by a fair title donald trump past preside t of the united states a convicted felon will now be the first convicted felon to gain the republican nominee before becoming a convicted felon he a convicted felon will now run for president as a convicted felon
the country falling apart and this is all they are focusing onthey dont care if trump is the salvation of this country as long their pockets are filled
finally fdt
so putin and biden are now the same when it comes to treatment of political rivals we knew this but its proven now sonothing has changed really
the beauty is that the precedent has been set now and biden can be prosecuted for his actual crimes the sad part is now we are officially a banana republic
just like the election rigged
someone let me know where to attend the riots when crook joe biden is elect in to office again election theft convict joe hunter for being the first crack head in the white house someone find that laptop
fcnn
id rather have a convicted felon for president than the idiot we have now
200000 illegal immigrants were on that jury these are terrible nasty people everyone agrees how many of them cast their guilty votes by mailin ballot all of them i dont know but thats what people are saying the defendant in this case
the first felony conviction of a former us president wasnt for the iraq or afghanistan wars illegal cia coups drone striking weddings or spying on americans it was because trump misclassified a 130000 payment for a porn stars nda tells you everything you need to know
oh michael so very very proud of you after everything vonshitzenpants has put our country through but especially you your family you hung in there through it all you fessed up to your faults paid the price then some now its trumps turn after he threw you this whole country under the bus for money power still hes at it still lying still grifting still whining doing all he can to grab every cent of power glory for himself destroy everything our beloved country stands for this is law order at its best you the meidas mighty the nydas office judge merchan those men women of the jury are to be commended to the heavens god bless you all i will personally be forever grateful to you all
trumps lawyers are so fired and not getting paid lol
all you dems are finished november 5th 2024
as if all the other government officials havent falsified documents pleassseeee remember lance armstrong getting caught for doping and as if nobody else in those races were dopingtrump just had the spotlight on him since day one
so of all the over 300 million americans it is only president trump who has falsified so called business records in america and must be convicted this is nothing other than political vendatta and witch hunting american politics descends into the gutters banana republuc what a shame
now a convicted felon
what was it hes guilty of again
its only unbelievable because we were uncertain that he was actually gonna be held accountable because he never has for anything else
trump derangement syndrome is all too real mainstream media believers are all too dumb
how did trump even agree to alll this
glad commie news network on the kno
poor jake he kept starting every statement with remember michael cohen is a liar knowing trump is the gloat he really wanted trump to be found not guilty sorry jake the jury has made their decision clear in 95 hrs thats how guilty he is jake
its all not rosy as many people are led to believe with this verdict ofcourse trump has done many criminal offences which previous president hasnt and i am not condoning any of them but the most important thing the left has to remember is that this is the man almost half of the country voted for in the previous two election cycles celebrating justice is well and fine but people on the other end are pissed and as a matter of fact categorising them as dumb and stupid will not take you far as kimmel often does people have legitimate interests and one has to recognise and discuss them if 90 except for fox and others of mainstream media is not able to understand what half of the americans say then there is something seriously wrong it begs the question whether they are in their own bubble this just increases the polarisation i am not an american citizen but i admire it in many ways hopefully it can sort itself out the world really needs a counterbalance to china
now can we have a presidential candidate that isnt ancient
this would be a very smart time for nikki haley to restart her campaign trump is now disqualified from running for president biden cannot run unopposed that would be a disaster for this fragile place were at with american democracy
the radical left have convicted trump for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind
it dont matter he still going to be president 2024 this is corrupt af when pedophiles and rapists get nothing smh where my rifle
if you can make that leap of logic why cant you put hillary and joey in front of a jury
there are millions americans who can be a better president than trump just leave him in jail and move on with our lives and country
im canadian and i know many people as well as me that are donating to the trump campaign to help crush the swamp aka radical left that are executing putin tactics on their political opponents new york just bacame laughing stock
the clintons spent days and tax payer money shredding boxes of documents in the white water scandal see wheres theres a 2 tiered justice system in this country
this is lawfare plain and simple and we all know it biden is just like putin he knows he can win in an election so hes trying to put his competition in jail this is going to backfire on the dems so badly
count 35 guilty of mass brain washing in the first degree
unpopular opinion im not a fan of trump but honestly that man is almost 80 years old and is facing justice for the first time so i just think its to damn late he got away with it for 77 years but hopefully less people vote for him
i explained over four years ago d trump was the last trump of god the warning that everyone needs to get their heart right with god or go down with him and biden who is bidin his time so the people can return to the truth and be set free christianity missed it too why because like judaism who missed it first they teach by the carnal mind the enemy of god the seed of the serpent the false prophet all religions teach by this method which is why the heart remains the beast that goes through all kingdoms and nations without being transformed into man in gods image and likeness that man is jesus god forms himself into man jesus within our heart the full stature of the inner man of our heart christians dont teach this adam is messiah he is the first adam in whom we died and he will be the last adam in whom we are made alive when adam becomes messiah as planned before the foundation of the world god didnt change his mind adams son is the born again adam the last adam the son of man and we are all members of his body we all become the living stones built upon the cornerstone christ anointing the yachidaonly son so the house temple never falls again the living stones the holy and royal priesthood david and aaron are the way god hashem builds his final temple the tabernacle of david a house of prayer for allllllll nations peoples egos will all fall because the ego is gog of magog the mountain of the mountains that will all be laid low by god when messiah the anointing rises within us bringing adam son of man to life along with moses elijah the prophets everyone god will suddenly rise in his temple his stony hearted people and in an instant he will destroy their vessel of vanity their ego and win the war of gog and magog so where do the jews fit in the jew is the circumcised heart of adam eve in whom we died hence the heart is wicked above all things and when this heart gives birth to the messiah anointing because he is not a physical man but gods image and likeness hence a life giving spiritual man vov in yhvh who is born through the heart to reveal the abomination of desolation in the heart holy place where it ought not be mathew 24 and once the abomination of desolation in the heart is revealed the anointing destroys it dan 9 because there is enough oil to cleanse the inner court or holy place hanukkah so eve the heart becomes the mother of all living when the heart is circumcised by the messiah who also gives life to her husband the carnal mind because this is adams curse since adam is the mind that fell to bring nothing good from the earth the serpent was created crooked by god and is adams will and the crooked is made straight by the messiah or the oil because it lifts the serpent up here is the resurrection of all three adam eve the serpent a three fold chord that will not be easily broken again if adam does not find the anointing within himself through all his members the stony hearts israel from the good ground mark 4 john 16 which is judah who took a vow to bring the anointing the good root of adam to the world nahum 115 then there will be a dead adam just recycling through dust dust dust because the dust is the serpents meat all its life to overcome hell death and the grave adam eve and the serpent have to rise above the dust and it is through the anointing through the messiah if i had not experienced this i would not know it was true but since i did on the jewish feast days of 1992 i know its true ignored for 31 years only proves that nobody wants to hear or see messiah because he ruins the party of self of the vessel of vanity that has its own ideas about how things will go through politics and religion that just keep making everything and i mean everything worse every day every minute the crooked serpent yetzer hora lashon hora does not love you hashem loves you but the serpent does not love hashem do not kid yourself that he loves him he may not be able to do anything outside of hashems will but hashem has given him free reign over you till you do teshuvah repent back to the good root of adam the messiah if you cant see his free reign as all the problems in the world then you can stay in exile with him hashem will allow it till he destroys him along with all the people who prefer him the carnal cursed mind seed of the serpent and false prophet just spins tales and more tales and never comes to the knowledge daat of the truth because it can not know the truth or god or the things of god and yet the world goes after him and all his nonsense and there is no one well i am here but there is no ear to hear me no one else can explain how to repent and where the messiah arise from within us because messiah went into exile with adam as a seed but he wont rise till we deny the yetzer hora and till we do teshuvah repent back to the good root that is within us but we ignore it in favor of the evil root that rules through our heart and to tovias viewers amazed at his intelligence speaking of how wonderful they have it because they know the true god hashem i say if you were tasting the lord you would not be close to ww3 i cant believe the strong delusion of people in religions all of them all of abrahams religions are a curse upon the earth instead of a light to the world abrahams children were supposed to remove adams curse but they just multiplied it billion fold and sit around congratulating themselves while billions keep dying
wow this was a truly ridiculous way of breaking this newswell done cnn this is why nobody takes you seriously anymore
dont want a felon to be the highest representative of united states of america no for president
such a loser at everything he does because hes a fraud the only thing trump will become is so much more pathetic and irelavent leading up to the big loss at the polls in november
the states need to make it illegal for a felon to be on a statenational ballot this still being a candidate for president should never be able to happen again
trumps campaign donations website keeps crashing this is the icing on the cake thank you dementia joe
lol did he really have to read all the verdict counts it literally feels like a cheesy saturday night live sketch
just cant hear this enough i really want this as my ring tone
something in the american justice system seems to still be working its just too bad that americans are so resistant to letting it work for them and a lot of kicking and screaming precedes justice of happening especially when the rich and powerful are concerned
hes just going to abuse the appeal process now this isnt over our justice system has too many ways to manipulate it for this to be over
great news finally i think the republican party may also be celebrating this guy was out of their control
the tantrum they threw in 2016 is still ongoing playing right into the communist insurgency strategy destroy faith in our institutions you won a major battle with the deck stacked against him in a kangaroo courtroom farce lets see how long your celebration lasts
lock him up lock him up
weaponization of the legal system just like in a dictatorship
black male watching from londonin response to my trump supporting neighbourcould someone please give me the proper criminal name for the 2nd criminal charge that trump got found guilty onmy neighbour claimed that nobody knows what it isi dont believe that for a second but i would be so grateful if someone had the proper name for trumps second criminal chargethank you
a liberal da a liberal judge a liberal jury with a couple that admitted they didnt like trump and gagged he was hanging before the trial even started congratulations democrats keep it up and youll have your banana republic
lock whom up waiting for someone to write an ironic song parody
the angry oompa loompa bought this upon himself thinking that he was untouchable and he could do whatever he wanted even though the judge kept warning him and he would just ignore the judge and now hes going to jail forever
just look at that face he must have been born like that
do you really think that saying the same thing over and over again makes a better point or are you just trying to impress on us that you can count that high saying that he was found guilty of 34 counts of the same thing would have given us all the same information without boring us to death with look mommy i can count to 34 arent i a good boy
he has only gained more votes the more biden looks like a puppet and not our leader as more horrible policy rolls out from this historically awful admin trump will be our next president
what a country our two best options for our leadership are 1 a felon and 2 an incompetent incoherent and infamous liar maybe theres hope in 2028 sure not visiting ny anytime soon they allow violent criminals to roam and convict a past potus for what exactly could never understand all i know is justice in ny exited long ago good luck embrace and enjoy your chaos
congratulations donald you finally got 100 of the vote
the man is guilty of slapping cheeks wtf didnt bill clinton clap cheeks in the oval office i dont care trump 2024 we need him in office
failed fake hoax scam sham charade after failed fake hoax scam sham charade in this banana republiclevel kangaroo court show trial of election interference
this will still drag on for months as obviously an appeal will eat up timethe american justice system is exhausting in its present formtrump will now play the victim and be using every method he knows to get donations to his campaignsickening
finallythis spoiled entitled con artist is held accountable he will never admit wrong doing for anything his mislead followers need to take off the blinders and see him for the manipulative criminal he truly is hes not a victim hes a prisoner of his own wrong choices
the jury has spoken donald j trump the j is for joker is a convicted felon america is greatagain
republicans in 2049 donald who never heard about that fella oh wait he was a commie hired by hillary and obama to make gop look bad i never trusted him
this all will have come as a total surprise to anyone who spent the last three weeks watching cnns awful coverage telling you how trump was going to be exonerated
guilty on 34 counts wonder if hell see a day in prison
joe biden will now be indicted the minute he leaves office by a republican da who will take this page from the democrats playbook the powerhungry democrats put their party above the country and opened pandoras box by prosecuting and potentially jailing a political opponent bec he threatens their power im ashamed to admit i voted for these clowns years ago this case was manufactured by a local da who campaigned on getting trump but has no authority to prosecute a federal elections case that both the fec and doj said there was no crime and by a corrupt democrat judge in a democrat city with a democrat jury let this charade go to trial
will trump be going to prison he could get 4years per each count
the judge was actually joe biden in a mask and all the jurors were biden family members according to trump f maga
it was good while it lasted
lawfare by democrats and despicable 100 casting my vote for trump
he will win on appeal very easily half the people commenting on here didnt pay attention to the trial at all lolguilty yayy but you didnt even pay attention to it idiots alot of shady shit happened with that corrupt judge and his instructions to the jury and last i checked the defense has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt hes guilty which they failed to do smh you people are stupid and dont know the law apparently
bill gates dr fauci other puppets of the new world order conspired to unleash a biological weapon against humanity to shut down the worlds economy for 18 months and rig an election and zero charges were brought against them george soros funded the black lives matter antifa more recently palestinian protests which collectively have caused over 1b in property damages zero charges were brought against him joe biden and the fbi lied about the laptop from hell which showed numerous images of hunter biden smoking crack having sex with underage prostitutes even when they knew about it before the 2020 election zero charges were brought against joe biden hillary clinton used a private email server for public communications lied to fbi about it and bleached the evidence zero charges were brought against her many of those emails included strange references to pizza pasta hot dogs and other pedophilic symbols with the podesta brothers who are known patrons of pedophilic artwork that they display in their homes zero charges were brought against hillary clinton
this conviction is perfect proof that america is too stupid to remain free
clearly election interference due to bidens incompetencedems have no faith in him
democrats are running a one party election bribedon or no one i am voting for trump anyway

1 trump must have known that cohen wasis a dishonest character when he appointed him and usedtasked him to carry out unlawfullshady dealings that alone speak volumes on his integrity or lack thereof 2 the bigest lie ever lets make america great again fact is that usa was is and will in the foreseeable future be the greatest nation in the world irrespactive of his destructive actions usa dominating footprint om all spheres wordwide is prove this 3 his narsistic character lack of respect for women and failure to take responsibility for his indiscretions failures lies etc is there for all to see and make him one of the most unpredictable persons ever
nothing is going to happen to trump because all of this legal crap is his campaign because he had nothing to campaign on our justice dept didnt even assign a special prosecutor until two years after january 6

convicted felon donald trump is so arrogant he never thought such a thing would happen convicted felon trump must face law just like anyone else convicted felon trump will try to convince people he is a victim but convicted felon trump not above the law
all i can say is this if he is not given a jail term like everyone else they your justice system is clearly about white privileged he needs to be jailed otherwise you are going to have everyone appealing there sentences siting trump trial case whats good for trump is good for all americans astonishing we all are waiting with bated breath it can only be jail time more pending

maga snowflakes out in full force to let us know how totally not upset they are
so the biden vs trump debate will take place between 2 6 pm on a wednesday or thursday at rikers then they also have visiting hours on weekends between 8am noon but who wants to wake up on a saturday morning listening to trump cry whine through a tin can sounding intercom system on the convicts side of the glass partition
history made guilty as charge on all counts amen
trump just handed biden the presidency with this verdict all biden has to do is stop screwing it up with all the tax hike talk and he will win stop hiking tax and stop talking about tax hike no one wants to pay more tax please for the love of all the country take this win without screwing it up with your stupid tax hike
hmmm yeah im gonna still vote for trump in 2024
who should play trump in the tv miniseries im thinking docudramedy so maybe john lithgow he did a great portrayal of roger ailes in 2019s bombshell
so hes going to prison and wont be out president
trump should have been the 2nd president to be found guilty after gw bush for his crimes against iraq
now lets hope this convicted felon is incarcerated and not merely given probation a nice 1218 month sentence in a nys mediumsecurity prison somewhere in northern ny state
they shouldve started with this stormy daniels thing years ago instead of the russian collusion obstruction of justice jan 6 et al we had to endure this was such an easy openandshut case
2020 the democrats bought in covid 2024 accusing the republican candidate of fake crimes the democrats really cannot win on merit isnt it
convicted felon is the new propaganda by the fake news media they have been waiting to run on for thier paid masters this has been their plan all along
makes me want to vote for him more and more and more
is falsifying business records a felony charge or misdemeanor injustice corrupt justice system in new york city
the real threat to democracy is the fake corrupt news media and the lawless democrat party lead by corrupt crooked joe biden
the real verdict will happen on november 5 where real independent mind with common sense will decide
joe son are far worse on every level of humanity and imagine if trump became the mayor of my town what then
so beautiful a moment of endearment for the weak and discriminated i dont believe in god but i most certainly believe in reaping a shitstorm when you sow pure undiluted hatred trumps place is in prison best way for this arrogant hatemoner to learn he should also be sentenced for contempt of court
i dont like candidates that have been found guilty of 34 felonies
as a nonus person from another first world country yes about time
im pretty sure biden just wants to get out of that debate
fantastic karma has no expiry date convicted felon donald trump now must face the penalty handed down by a jury australia australia

i would also like to say that i will rewatch this video every single day when i wake up for the next month just want to make sure i heard it right
bro got his lawyers off craiglist

saddest day in american history
i have already told my iphone to put this in as a holiday every year cant believe it finally happened
i love america but im very disappointed right now the legal system is broken
you cant pick 12 democrats from ny bias jurors this is tyranny
i cant wait for cnn to report whos doing cocaine at the white house still voting trump 2024 fjb
we now officially live in a banana republic whether you love trump hate trump or couldnt care less about trump its undeniable that this was a weaponization of the justice system against a hated political rival the democrats in a deep blue state fulfilled their campaign promises to get trump their hated and feared political rival by any means possible they weaponized the justice system repeatedly until they finally found the right mix of judges jurors and fabricated charges where they couid get a verdict that went their way its a blatant weaponization of the justice system and its unconscionable those who have a visceral hatred for trump have proven time time again that they will say or do anything to defeat him those same people who accuse their opponents of being a threat to our democracy are in actuality the biggest threat to democracy and the biggest threat to fair equal justice under the law the trumphating main stream media who are supposed to hold politicians and the justice system accountable for misdeeds or at least ask tough questions instead cheered on the procescution the credibility and voracity of the charges werent important it was trump and thats all that mattered guilty of everything guilty of anything just get him meanwhile they remain uninterested in the antics of the biden family except to make excuses and look the other way the democrats have always been vocal about the corruption and bias within law enforcement and the justice system they point out the false convictions and the people convicted falsely because of that corruption but now when they have their own target the hated guy that they must get anything goes corruption and weaponization of the justice system in this case is just fine because the ends justify the means
if trump climbs in the polls the deep state may assassinate him welcome to communist america without a shot fired
now that you wanna push this kind of stuff trump will win the election you shouldve left it alone trump 2024 this country red
i dont respect any government that would lie on people yall been so cruel home president donald trump
now we have to chose between a convicted felon and a guy who wasnt prosecuted because he was old and senile
judge finds trump guilty the jury was handpicked by judge merchon they were told to find him guilty and they did
so its all the same charge zzz trying to make this man look like a mexican drug lord saying he has 30 some charges i cant believe americans are making such a big deal over these petty charges call me when he actually does something harmful this is akin to lying on your taxes does that make you a horrible person to be ostracized from society no it does not he isnt hurting anyone its not that big of a deal im not a supporter of his but we have more important things to be worried about in this nation and everyone knows it the media is just a distraction lets focus on the economy financial equity and the standard of living ok nobody cares about this trash story and the obsession the media has with trump
18 million felons eligible to vote in the us looks like trump just picked up some new supporters
trump finally won the popular voteall 34 of them

okay ive heard of double jeopardy but cmon now thats infinity jeopardy why so many charges for one crime
he should move all his wealth to russia as a punishment to usa
what a load of crap
now lets harp on jared and convict him
communism has prevailed
im sorry but it is unfathomable that trump has the momentum to win with 34 felony convictions i dont care what you think or what you believe are you seriously gonna stick to your party and let a convicted felon be the face of our country i get it wed rather pick the lesser of two evils trump and biden are extremely unpopular but we dont have to vote for either to me a trump presidency is the nail in the coffin for american stability id much rather take my chances with rfk jr at this point i encourage everyone who watches this to open your mind and inform yourselves fully of at least trump biden rfk
what comes around goes around all the presidents will be brought to court in the future trump 2024
its the same charge worded 28 different ways
i will have to revise my plan to fall asleep during my trial and refusing to take the stand if i ever commit a crime
a jury of his peers not the deep state not some political appointee not some secret cabal but citizens of this country have found trump guilty of all charges
joe biden is next with the congressional investigation of money received from china russia funneled through shell companies with hunter biden of course complete denial
kerp quite cnn and stop promoting evil
nice graphics
america just had another 9 11 what a shame
and he will not serve a single day in jail because the system is completely corrupt and there is a chance he will be the next president as well how to sum up how broken america is right there
america is healing
a conviction without a crime vote trump24
it was a shame and politically motivated americans are not stupid this is no different from a thirdworld country using the legal system to bury their political opponents sad day in america
im going to teach my kids to count to 34 with this video
thats bigly guilty
why does trump think he doesnt have to obey the law thats what jails are for
this is my new ringtone
and how many more cases does he have this is just the first not good
united state of america must quickly be punished and imprison donald trump
trump is guilty and i am very happy because the whole world will become a better place to live especially in the united states of america joe biden for president of usa 2024 to 2027
no 1 is above the law except if your 1 biden colluding with ukraine on tv as vp 2 hillary deleting 3000 classified emails 3 obama sending billions of dollars to iran on a plane 4 bill clinton on jeffery epstein island 5 nancy palony hiding the jan 6th full videos for people to see 7 jamaal bowman pushing the fire alarm on purpose so were even more determined now to vote for president trump now you reading this instead of cursing screaming n howling at the moon like you lefties normally do remember facts dont care about feelings so is any of the 7 things i mentioned is a lie
lock him up lock him up
thanks new york hey businesses come on down south where we treat you the right way trump 2024
these are the really sad times mutilation teenagers and convicting guys for their manhood in the name of gender equality which is against nature where everything exists in duality
these are the really sad times mutilation teenagers and convicting guys for their manhood in the name of gender equality which is against nature where everything exists in duality
hilarious
it was a beautiful verdict from good people from both sides of the jury the most beautiful just trial in history billions of people watched now put orange turd under the jail i mean just lift corner of jail up throw donnie under and let it drop now enjoy mushroom cloud of cheeto dust erupt from beneath
interestingguilty on 34 counts and never explained what he is actually guilty of no crime is named yet
if dems had a braintheyd be dangerous there was no falsifying of business records trump was paying his lawyer cohen it was marked in the ledger a legal expense what else is he suppose to call it when paying a lawyer a lunch at fcking mcdonalds triple facepalm
question since trump was found guilty for hush money does this mean bill clinton can be charged with his 15 hush payments some were found dead so does this mean a formal investigation into why the clintons paid for the killings of numerous people asking for america
wray will stage another insurrection now
but not for warp speed murders let that sink in
he wont do a day in jail guess hes way to powerful regular citizen years put away life
yea terrific newswe applaud the jury
count tresson your allguilty
sic semper tyrannis this is why we have the 2nd seceed now
guilty or not guilty shame on those who want their president to be a rapist fraudster and indicted criminal for crimes against the united states of america
i wonder if poor donny is wishing he never had run and won he was put under a microscope he seemed to know on election night he was in shock he never really wanted to be president he just wanted attentionwell he sure got it
a felon cannot vote so does that mean that a felon cannot run for office
he cant vote for himself
what say the people of america
the world is laughing at how low america has fallen
ineffective and effective assistance of counsel
bounce those checks
obama drone strikes dozens of innocent children and nobody bats an eye trump does the dirty with one pawn star and everyone loses their minds
the trump children have taken stupidly to a whole new level
hows he gonna squirm out of this one
just want you all to know that democrat judge prosecutor jury and state against a republican was a big mistake and you will pay for it
jail that pos
this is b in this country is dealing with the most awesome president i cant believe this is happening
hes a convicted felon he cant own a gun he cant even vote for himself hey shitzyourself isnt it past your jail time
about time hes finally accountable for his crimes taken 8 years
if the jury convicted on all 34 counts i would think deliberations would take longer than 11 hours to methodically make sure convictions were warranted on all 34 counts
so sad while this circus happens we have soft on crime policies
your life is sooooo messy how you want to be a president to take care of the country
how many jurors will be killed by magaots and trump cult members
it is amazing that you still cannot state that trumps crime was election interference he did to whole thing to keep the voters from knowing what he did are you still trying to become the next fox propaganda
whitecollar crime hell receive house arrest or probation at most
karma found him finally all those contractors he never fully paid people he hustled on scams women he abused american service men he discounted and at the end greed and panties took you down enjoy prison food
we know he most likely wont be imprisoned we know hell drag out the appeals process hell huff puff and lie and brazenly protest his innocence we know all that but whats great is that he had to endure it he had to sit there while cohen spoke while stormy daniels spoke when the guilty verdict was read out 34 times no shame or remorse obviously hes incapable of that but perhaps a glimmer of pain regarding melania or barron or even his deceased parents that can never be taken away
now thats a spanking this man baby deserved
such a fraud trump now he will say all jurors are corrupted blah blah
that means trump cant even cross the border to visit my canada we dont let in felons
this is the most brainwashed comment section have ever seen
guilty of all charges made by a radical marxist da funded by an overseas marxist billionaire and convicted by democrat marxist judge who spits in the face of impartiality democrats have jumped off the cliff here yet again
guilty on all accountsgo to russia
every republican with a few working brain cells had to be dreading this moment
what do you expect especially from a convicted liar and criminal like disgusting trump send him to rot in jail
what do you expect especially from a convicted liar and criminal like disgusting trump send him to rot in jail
now tell me how a man with 34 felony can run for president of america but in the same usa a man with just 1 felony can not vote how this make sense
trump should take all his businesses ad money out of ny state
putin has truely influenced this country manipulation of the criminal justice system by a political party criminalizing political opponents and weaponizing law enforement great job fascists had this been held in a district that wasnt bias as hell i think a lot of folks would cope but when everything is meant to be bias from the jump judge jury district and result we say fuck no what ever happens to this country going forward know its due to the progressives ripping us apart you cant say its worth civil war to go after a famous person paying hush money most of dem hollywood does it and no one cares cant say its for secret docs when so many dems admit to doing so for free cant say its for evaluation of property which is a business norm its fascism controlling law enforcement by a single political party for party agenda the nazis are rising and ignorant college educated people are chanting for it with the media in their corners some day we will watch movies like schindlers list about folks just like them
trump can finslly say he won a popular vote now
sad to read so many comments cheering for such a shameful trial this is the end separation of powers our judicial system is corrupted
justice a poem humpty trumpty sat on his wall humpty trumpty did feloniously fall the long count of thirty four lets give him many more
all small secret phones are out now until july 11the sentence date trump his lawyers his council team familys will makes phones calls and arrangements for him to have probation andor fine sentence but they will do all for him to not have a prison sentence jury and court parts done it is the political parts now wait and see
god bless america i know this verdict wont do much and its probably all for show but maybe just maybe well see some actual change within our beautiful country as opposed to the gerrymandering and bs our leaders are pulling
when republicans get to the white house they will even go after the grandfather and the grandchildren of biden and clinton
so your home is only worth what the government says its worth now so if i over sale or under sell a home the government wants the difference or the banks take it and felony charges and that includes renters being if the owner loses it to the bank they homeless am i wrong somewhere on this because it seems like i should vote for trump now
oh this is good news justice for one small part of his corrupt conman life of misleading and groups of people hooray
if trump is thrown in jail the american people will surrender to the democrat party but will they
if a single felony is bad this sob has to pay for all 34cant wait to see what his punishment will be
i hope the jury is protected especially as this goes up on appeal and stands maga is going to lose their minds
im glad because it will make him more popular than ever trump 2024
see its not just that he was found guilty its that he was found guilty on all charges he cant even argue that he was found not guilty on some of them the jury was unanimous that is damning and his appeal is going to be a serious uphill battle which i dont think will succeed he will now forever have be known as a convicted felon and the thing is this is the least serious of his criminal charges he still have to face those the walls are closing in hes been found liable in a civil fraud case found liable in his case of slander and now found guilty in a criminal case of fraud the clear evidence of the fact trump is a fraudster is overwhelming and its only going to get worse when his other trials finally go forward he cant hide from them forever he can blame and deflect and cry witch hunt all he wants but this is all on him congratulations donald you are a felon and you completely deserve it
a great day for america and the rule of law magas champion loses bigly again and again im getting tired of all this winning i hope his sentence is weekends picking up trash in the subway and cleaning toilets in the port authority
this just guaranteed trumps victory in 2024
somewhere hillary clinton is laughing her ass off

conservative news outlets and trump sycophants are going bathit crazy calling this a witch hunt ignoring facts and the law they are willing to throw the baby out with the bath water to support this convicted felon fraudster lying conman unbelievable isnt it what respectable country wants a convicted felon as the leader of the government the audacity to blame biden the democrats and the doj of conspiring against him is ridiculous he is the only one responsible for his actions he paid to cover up his adulterous affair falsifying business records to hid the fact no one but him hes guilty and hes a liar

articles of impeachment exhibited by the house of representatives of the united states of america in the name of itself and of the people of the united states of america against joseph r biden jr president of the united states in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors article i abuse of power article ii dereliction of duty
this has sealed the win for donald trump you now have a martyr folks he has been charged with ridiculous things that have not been considered in a courtroom for years just like every other liberal plan it makes his poll numbers go up every time
theres nothing democratic about the crooked fake dnc mafia and their kangaroo courts those who support it for their own malevolent and personal interests are also throwing away their own human rights and now go down into history in infamy as the judases that betrayed great america
shut the hell up trashy cnn
couldnt happen to a nicer guy
delete the justice system
straight to appeals he has not been convicted of anything
whew
you have to read each one lol what a joke you are cnn
hello melania going to stand by your man forgot its a transactional marriage
trump is a con wicked man
guilty on all counts
when the sixes rotate to the nine the elite the leaders the lapdog media and all their professionals who steered the people away from self responsibility steered them away from neutrality to then polarize the people into bondage heaving one sided selfish attacks at so called political opponents both foreign and domestic to further elevate the power and wealth of the privileged few all while ignoring vast environmental destruction due to an overpopulation of consumers chasing more and more ignoring the chaos and confusion descending into anarchy and ignoring the lack of peace and cooperation that is sending the world to war will have their arms legs and heads from their controlling torsos and fed to the starving swine
you can hear their reaction lol
now spend the rest of your short life in prison
the sad part is this wont change the minds of many if any of his supporters they are the same types that supported hitler to the end
pyrrhic victory all you have to do is look at what it took to find him guilty if you think it was legal or just you are literally part of the problem democrats can never win on ideas they are the weak side of the human condition democrats just made the country weaker today nothing more trump will be the next president congrats
what a sham trump 2024 we stand with him and israel brandon can get rekt
it happen to alexei navalny and now it is happen to donald trump
i still would rather have trump as a president than biden 4 more years of biden will have me looking the world over for a better and safer place to live
justice prevailed
trumps going to win for sure because if this
america wants to see true justice
their running their news of the conviction like a damn election results
cant wait for snl version of hush money trial
since it has been deemed unconstitutional to recite or study gods and jesus teachings about proper human behavior this demonstrates that the issue is that the usa cannot claim that its laws are superior to gods ten commandments or jesus teachings about our responsibilities to god and our fellow humans in 1948 and 1963 the scotus declared it illegal for students to recite gods ten commandments or jesus teachings about our duties to god and our fellow humans before 1948 reciting or studying these teachings was not considered unconstitutional but now we have a legal system that does not uphold the us constitution it has been deemed unconstitutional to recite or study gods and jesus teachings about proper human behavior therefore corruption of the american legal system is an unavoidable side effect of legal workers having an education where it has been declared illegal to recite jesus instructions regarding our duties toward god and our fellow humans there is no valid reason why american citizens should not memorize and frequently recite jesus instructions written in matthew 54347 matthew 712 matthew 191819 matthew 2026 matthew 2221 and matthew 223640 those who disagree with this statement should explain how our nation could enjoy more freedom if people in government were allowed to act against the teachings of jesus
guilty as charge for all 31 count he cant be untouchable forever he is not invincible once hes convicted
this is truely an unforgettable moment in us history we are now on par with stalins soviet union
guilty to the 16th power
who cares geeze
now lets see how many buisnesses in ny state will be charged with falsifying records merchan thanks the jurers knowing that there never was any possibility of president trump being aquitted on any single charge much less all of them this was and forevermore will be the greatest travesty of justice in american history this kind of trial i would expect in china russia iran venesuela and several other socialist communist and marksist countrys
for those of you who dont understand why this is a blatant corruption of our judicial system look at it this way imagine you got pulled over for a dui several years ago which was a misdemeanor now imagine that today the courts decided to purposely change the level of a dui to a felony and then they came and arrested you and prosecuted you for a felony now imagine that you were the only american citizen that they did this to every american should be concerned about judicial corruption used to damage a political opponent like this thats called socialism its out right to have the choice of which candidate we want for president without interference theres only one current administration that is a legitimate threat to democracy
if its a minority they want the book thrown at them if its trump they want him freecommitting more crimes the tough on crime party lol
jews did this and trump keeps praising them anyway
thank you jurors mr bragg and your amazing team for upholding the law regardless of the individual

and watch he will be the first president on probation lol what a joke all this for what just throw him in prison already
my god and the americans are allowed to vote for that guy i feel sorry for your country
the verdict is not unexpected trump is guilty of 34 felony charges falsifying business records in order to hide payments to daniels in an attempt to buy her silence to keep information from the voters in 2016 its not the only instance where he tried to tamper with the election process including courting russian influence and of course j6 plus the stolen documents case which are other cases yet to be tried the rule of law holds but its being stressed and will be for the foreseeable future
as an independent i can say that was not a jury of mr trumps peers i can also say that who cares are country is being invaded and my small business is barely surviving
his 2nd charge is coving up a payment his lawyer made thats not a crime this system has tried to lock me up for nothing now they do it to a former president no respect on the democratic side sad day indeed
all he do win win win the most wining anyone has ever won
this is all wrong we all know witch hunt media hype
yet war criminals obamabiden and bush walk freedisgraceful
so the next photo i will see of trump will be trump being let of in handcuffs and a lovely orange jump suit if he gets a fine or probation i will lose my mind

you all are dirty as hell
trump is angry he is headed to 5th avenue
all the judges that ive seen interviewed since the verdict say he wont go to jail its a class e felony and he has no priors what the hell was all this then they all knew that even if this happened thered be no punishment
what do you expect you had a kangaroo court with the kangaroo jurors so what do you expect youre going to get definitely not a fair trial all the way around biden if youre watching this your turn next
its official fake presidents day 05302024 every year just to remind us we almost lost our entire country trump really was going to sell america out
flush the orange turd
lets hope the judge has the guts to send the convicted felon to prison
party tonight
when trump is president i cant wait to see him go after biden n all his crooked minions the judges n prosecutors
90 that was what dems needed to stop him from being president again
the republican party should disqualify him from running and put in the runner up
entire corrupt system hates and fears trump guilty
just donated to trump for president not for the reason you think justice system was weaponized and whored out to serve a political party this country is in big trouble the dnc is tearing this nation apart
i think im going to set this video clip as my daily morning alarm i cant imagine a better song to wake up to each day
trump won the popular vote finally
but he gave millions to charities
hush money i thought he was just paying for a bj
could this please be the beginning of trump disappearing from american politics etc
yet no accountability whatsoever on biden on the afghanistan pullout open borders signing over our sovereignty to the who etc etc etc etcetc
mother teresa
lock her upi mean him you get it
hes definitely crooked now following this conviction by a jury can he really call joe biden crooked now
when is cnn trial for falsifying news still voting trump 2024
i always knew he is 100 percent committed to committing crimes it was a perfect score
cover up to steal an election
peers my ass
now for the next court case
cnn youre guilty of all 34 count cnn youre guilty of all 34 counts cnn youre guilty of being online discussing news station cnn news you are guilty of any association with abc nbc msnbc you are all traders of the united states of america youre going down god bless donald j trump our next president and that is what it is not much to do to help me god i tell nothing about the truth one nation under god individually and justice for all you guys going to get justice up against you guys want me to take everything mother cnn guilty of treason sitting in guilty of being a traitor cnn guilty for protecting the lives of this great nation cnn guilty and thats the truth nothing but the truth so help me god
1751 falsifying business records has been a crime since at least 1986 before then i guess that it would have fallen under a more general fraud charge
a sad day to new york and america new york judicial system is death no more justice to be found you are a democrat you can commit a crime and got away if you are a republican you are guilty even without crime a very sad day for new york and for justice
that was seven or eight years ago and theyre just trying to do it now of course its in new york
this could be a rigged trialconsidering just the other day his ralley in the bronx had over 20000000 attendantshmmm
by this ny democrat jury
thank you face smiling thank you jurors for following the law
he will see the executive mansion only with binoculars not top secret clearance for intelligence briefings so long donald such a beautiful trial they all love me on the jury and confimed i was a racist felonies narcistic guiltyguiltyguilty and a blackman charged him
they just elected president trump america seized through this crap and we know whats going on and you guys are part of it and hopefully when he becomes present hell charge all of yall for treason
if only there was a more concise way to report this news
well he finally got the majority of the vote
you bet your ass those bible have a huge discountnow trump bibles was 5999 now 599get em while thier hot
lib not even child groomers get this many felony charges rep exactly our point not even pedophiles have this many charges this will be overturned and america will soon find out the lying thieves democrats really are
trump is built for pressure biden could never handle this
a jury of 12 ordinary citizens have more patriotism better judgement more courage and higher integrity than nearly every republican senator who betrayed their oath and betrayed their country by failing to convict the convicted felon for the january 6th attack on this country that the convicted felon planned incited and sat back and watched unfold republican senators you are a disgrace and these jurors just showed you how to do your job thank you jury for defending democracy you are heroes
yuuuuuge crowd at the big house waiting for him
traitor trump 0 chance to win in november just cheat if u have to biden stay in power no matter what cheat like traitor trump did
so i guess bill clinton is next for paying paula jones 850k to shut up go away or maybe adultry in the whitehouse while on duty as the potus no why the double standard for dems vs republicans
now is the time for all you americans to loudly demand his sentence is based on the past cases of others precedent if his charges are based on his short term mediocre presidency rather than precedent then the workers of the us need to all go on strike until proper justice is done
they did this during election year corruption at its finest its crazy how divided is the us instead of uniting against others
the fix was in joe biden will now be indicted the minute he leaves office by a republican da who will take this page from the democrats playbook the powerhungry democrats put their party above the country and opened pandoras box by prosecuting and potentially jailing a political opponent bec he threatens their power this case was manufactured by a local da who campaigned on getting trump but has no authority to prosecute a federal elections case that both the fec and doj said there was no crime and by a corrupt democrat judge in a democrat city with a democrat jury who let this charade go to trial and who violated judicial ethics on many occasions that will lead to this case being reversed on appeal
convicted yet i doubt hell be punished for it hes the teflon don of mob bosses and will never be punished to the full extent of the law because he has the corrupt supreme court in his back pocket
this country has now became lawless you sheep are in for a rude awakening
at least you guys picked a cool thumbnail trump looking like a g
everyone talking about the same thing nobody talking about what the punishment would be
the question is what are we going to do about it this sonofabitch will get through the cracks like he always did and worse than that he will be our next president as for me im leaving america for another country ive been planning it for years and if the country im going to asked me to give up my american passport i would do it in a heartbeat this is how toxic our political debates have become
let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and those that exist have been instituted by god therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what god has appointed and those who resist will incur judgment for rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad would you have no fear of the one who is in authority then do what is good and you will receive his approval for he is gods servant for your good but if you do wrong be afraid for he does not bear the sword in vain for he is the servant of god an avenger who carries out gods wrath on the wrongdoer
listen folks if the democrats can do this to trump the democrats will do the same thing to you never ever vote for another democrat
trump guilty on all 34 counts let the whining begin no convicted felon for president jail trump now vote blue
the system works vote bluepleeez
i got the most perfect verdict believe me djt
fake
absolutely fantastic news
trump should have been taken into custody immediately after trial pending sentencing
just came to say fu cnn
those jurors are no ones peers
trump literally just won the election
maga fantasy world hits the brick wall of reality at break neck speed
oh what a day what a lovely day
nothing is gonna happen to him sadly
a stormy verdict forecast in new york today
its a beautiful day in america
trump is now more desperate than he has ever experienced in his entire affluent and charmed life he said it himself with these words the real verdict will be nov 5th so now the clock is finally ticking on him a lost would mean after the initial hubbub trump will shrink into a little man caught up in trial after trial shuffling from courthouse to courthouse hell fade from the front pages to surface on when other convictions come down a fitting end to a truly bizarre political saga
lolthis is the biggest pile of cow crap i have ever seen
the only shameful thing are the republicants coming out for him and fluffing him up im guessing the house gop will pass some meaningless resolution condemning the verdict trump is akin to john gotti now
wheres that small loan of a million dollars now
all of these charges and you can all go to hell
when you believe michael cohen to convict then you have no morals
thank you to the 12 jurors because justice matters
loser trump and his grifting family is done
if you guys agree with this bs then you are blind to the weaponizing of our judicial system this was all a witchhunt by the democratic party today im ashamed to ever have been a democrat voted obama but november i will vote for this so called felon
biden is the reason for inflation in america
i had a crooked judge a democrat judge a democrat jury and the judge would not let trump have any witnesses and the judge tell the jury they cannot leave today get a guilty verdict this what you do in a third world country
no man is above the law and that also applies to whatever trump is
the sad state of american politics
jack odonnell former president coo of trumps casino barb res former exect vp of trumps co were both on cnn at 740 pm and they both stated finally hes been convicted of his crimes barb worked for trump 18 years knows his cons schemes well they also warned of his vindictiveness eg the jurors prosecution witnesses now have to be protected from the fanatics within trumps cult as hell continue to incite them with his constant lies
witchunt bullshit what a joke
cohen went to prison for trump directing him to break the law the man who ordered the criminal behavior should also be guilty
justice finally
from the river too the ocean
thank you all this only solidifies he will be elected president this year he just won the black vote for being found guilty compton has trump flags all over the place right now and its crazy
stop i can only be so erect at a time
i can imagine him thinking those arent my peers though im above everybody
perfect score
so does this mean that trump cant vote for himself in november serious question
count von count sesamestreet
how can this clown possibly be in a position to make a run at the presidency after this what will it take for the trump fanatics to face the facts about this guy are you that blind america
move on jake the entire world knows trump is a scum bag this is not news news is why president joe biden is backing netanyahus genocide of palestinians in gaza
trump 2024 for prison yard shot caller
mad props for all the jurors
a masterclass in repetition
still not voting for genocide joe
four more years of biden and this country will be 100 in war with russia and china we will be a one party system there will be two classes rich and poor christians will be not allowed to practice their religious beliefs first amendmentgone second amendment gone people will be surveilled like in china you will own nothing and like it you think democracy was upheld here for donald trump and his supporters democracy this was the biggest step to rid this country of being a democratic republic
michael cohen went to prison for 3 years after pleading guilty to the exact same crimes cohen didnt publicly attack the jurors the family of the judge the prosecutors and others donald trump must go to prison for the 4 year maximum penalty on each of 34 counts 134 years seems right vote blue
glad we dont have to worry about him being president again
all bullshit
at last grabbed
the people calling this justice are scary they cant be saved
all this for a presented we wanted but we can all agree on biden after right whats the next fuck up for 4 years how we fighting a system that cant even be a functional system having people locked up being victims and locking away more of the suspect lookalike crazy we think of old cases being solved with todays era do we have to wait another generation to get justice when all yall do is ticket the hardworking ones corrupted as fuck how you expect people from project leaving when you 53 hundred less in rent they have to live in that poverty they been wanting to escape obviously there tryna coupe being realistic most thugs only have a mom and shes to bussy maintaining the house hold but yet they think they brothers love them why they forget about you in jail and cant find no way back but to play victim system is fucked and killing is a confidence to these youth crazy to think most these murders came from somewhere they family wanted to give a chance too
now america is like the other thrid world countries political
democrats are celebrating ya bums
yall have no idea that ww3 is about to start as the same time this happens i hope you guys are all ready for the draft
pinocchiofound guilty
how much you wanna bet that not 1 charge will hold up on appeal but thats not what this was about was it its gonna backfire lol
as soon as it is perfectly established that he is ineligible to hold the office of potus putin is going to show america what a traitor to his country trump really is because he would be no more use to him
you couldnt make me go to nyc these were cohen invoices lying stealing cohen let that sink in dems make a hero of the devil to try a stop trump time for americans to take our country back 2020 was an obvious falsification of documents by intelligence officials in the hunter biden report yet they do this to trump over invoices and bank entries in 2016 talk about criminal
we are officially a 3rd world country under the most corrupt regime this country has ever seen still voting trump 2024 and just donated to his campaign the site is down due to traffic looks like a lot of people are doing the same
yippeeee american democracy won
it is unbelievableweaponizing the doj against another political partywe fkn columbia now lefties are trash
this is a no brainer for this to get overturned rules of evidence was not followed that alone will get it tossed but democrats knew this all along ruthless politics biden and the establishment are in for rude awakening
how is this clown even a presidential candidate
guilty guilty guilty the system does appear to work i live in canada and have been obsessed with this case to the point where my husband thought maybe i had a problem i kid you not a bird pooped on me this morning before work and i absolutely knew the verdict would come in today guilty i am so very happy for the usa right now i wish you all luck in november
woke globalists that is

djt reminds me of de niro as al capone in the untouchables threatening bitching at eliot ness all the way to prison thank you bob de niro
the end is near for our freedoms
it will be overturned its just a matter of time meanwhile they will program you for the next 6months with the phrase convicted felon
if you think trump got a fair trail you are blind to justice and only have eyes for your party trump is innocent and is now a martyr for freedom and the american people
thank you judge and jury for helping trump win the presidency in november
stormy daniels the booty that saved democracy
holy s
american has no right to point fingers at any other nation because america no longer ais a constitutional republic we are officially a banana republic
communists are running amok the weaponization of the american justice system to silence or crush any political opposition should be alarming to the public we are in a slippery slope for the life of our great republic we are heading for or are already in a silencing police state if you oppose the work globalists you will be crushed
ok i would be going to prison for at least 20 years what will he do
so this guy is guilty of a felony for paying a mistress off and trying to hide the payment thats a felonyfederal offense for hiding mistess payments
donald trump just became the nelson mandela of americaevery ex president alive in america should fear and embrace this new system of justice in americaif trump is convicted after 8 yearsjoe biden will be convicted in dayswe all know he is not clean not to mention his family
he loves criminals now hes one himself
thank you jury and judge for your courage and service to the truth
wow 10 minutes to say they found him guilty
you mean to say that a republican was found guilty of a crime in a democrat state in an election year oh nooooo
trump has a rap sheet as long as my arm lol
ok prison now
my popcorn on this day tastes so good
democracy prevails if you dont like it move to russia with donald
now on to the sentencing arguments ten years hard time done deal
this will only boost his polls
if i win it wasnt rigged if i lose it was rigged
there is a god
at least nixon had the dignity to resign after disgracing himself this convicted criminal does not have any integrity whatsoever nor does he feel any accountability or remorse hell just keep on scheming and his followers will keep denying and living in a fantasy world
don lemon sucking up wonder why hes sucking on to get that job back remember cnn got done leaving now after the verdict goblin for a job back and he cant wait to get outside of the smear the former president god bless the former president do you want to know his name donald j trump a true a true hero god bless you later i give three hearts to donald j trump
what about joe sending money to the taliban and storing documents and records in his garage no ones charging him for that stuff this all is a setup starting to look more like a jake paul fight

he finally made america great again
boohoo don lemon sucking up to see msnbc i guess thats what station he was on i dont know he just a damn phone cnn maybe hes on that anyway it doesnt matter so hes really crying he wants his job back and hes doing real good job of sucking up
but his due process rights were violated by a biased democrat judge and jury who prosecuted him for federal crimes in a state court
guess when he gets reelected trump will have to get his doj to actually take hillary to court an then of course biden will be in court untill his passing so hope it was worth it guys
34 different records were falsified at 34 different times
i cant wait to vote for this great man god bless donald trump

are you legally blind and have the government pay for your food and well being or are you just a rich person that doesnt even look at the prices because youre entitled did you actually do proper unbiased research or just read headlines of controlled main stream media the entire country is hurting core inflation is up 13 since biden took office groceries are up 50 fast food has doubled gas is more it was way more until biden needed to get votes 14 million illegal immigrants have crossed our borders crime and human trafficking is up murderers and violent convicts being released with no bail atf are killing people serving unannounced search warrants the deficit is the highest its ever been in the history of america and our schools are indoctrinating the kids how blind can you be we need to come together as a country this is not about dem or repub this isnt about race or religion this is about a place we all have to live together i beg you do proper research with an open mind and you will see things very differently if you think this trial was handled properly you are infact blind and have not done your due diligence try again dig deeper and this time ask the right questions then make an educated well informed decision the very fabric of our country depends on it

87 of the jurors voted for biden no surprise when you weaponize a judicial system against your political opponent funny how everyone loves to say orange man bad but not take any accountability for the disaster of an administration biden has had so far its all smoke and mirrors to keep attention away from pedo joe
i want to say hello t i foxnews hello you all wrong foxnews known all along trump is guilty
election interference at its finest
as an atheist thank god still springs to mind
the american people know that this is a sham trial

found guilty of 34 charges he can even be sentenced and still can become president and literally be president from prison i didnt think so but just read an article on this maybe im wrong id like to be because it doesnt matter which party one is fromone shouldnt be allowed to run with even just 1 felony
what really happed in merchans court today with trumps conviction is that the flag of tyranny has been planted our legal system in the united states will forever change for the worse vote trump24
three more indictments to gonobody loses in court like trump
still waiting on hillary illegal acts pelosi insider trading acts biden circumventing congress keeping confidential white house papers when a vp a known illegal act whomsoever left cocaine in the big house during a tour etc etc etc oh yeah the laundrring of funds thru ukraine by joe and his son and election tampering 81k votes god save america
definitely going to look more in to this
the image of the judicial system have to be protected specially by the law makers the world its watching that bullt of political persecution you can see it third world countries no in the united states of america but america has proven that no one its above the law and thats what we have to project to the world
only scotus will determine case outcome nobody else none of scotus judges will be recusing themself those are the facts
its gonna be awfully embarrassing for biden when voting stats show half the country would rather vote for a literal convicted felon than four more years of dementia dan
great example make america great againthank you
horseshit
its just a disgrace them coming up with a verdict
guilty america is greatagain
this is ridiculous every document is a charge and why isnt biden charge with treason
shock of shocks law fair at its worst all based a proven liars testimony shame on them all
now this will make america great again
even in jail he will be the president donald j trump thank you
its just a big game we play in todays society those with the money and play the game will be the winners because they do what they are told those with lots of money that are honest and hardworking people are the ones that will lose because they didnt follow the game take a look at what happened in canada truck drivers bank accounts were seized because they tried to be for the people protesting for a good reason
1 presidential convict down with 1 more presidential convict to go
thats quite the resume for the so called law order president
what a fabulous day in history i see a lot more lawyers not getting paid
this is what happens when the guy whos entire life is built on lies and cheating isnt allowed to lie and theres no way to cheat
theyd rather falsely accuse an innocent man of things that he didnt do then keep rapists and murderers out of this country via the border
so bogus what a circus court hopefully this is overturned before the election
guilty of being americas greatest ahole
congratulations usa rico take all
rigged by a judge who is a democrat donor along with his daughter and an all dumbocrat jury welcome to our banana republic
alright so now hes been convicted what does this mean for the election can he still run if he wins can he overturn this verdict and exonerate himself up till now trump has seemed bulletproof and able to get away with anything what will this conviction change going forward
so basically half the countries vote wont really matter anymore wonder if thats ever happened before they couldve had the trial after he lost the election civil war 20 caused by a porn star will be one for the books
gulity but is he actually going to jail 100 ĥis pamper must be getting crowded as is magas
finally some good news
thank you jury
sentence large fine and community servicemaybe probation
now thothe appeals start
cnn is so pathetic you call yourself journalist ha ha pitiful why dont you pathetic people tell the truth this is a setup from the corrupt justice department corrupt judge unbelievable that cnn shows lies and pushes bullshit lies like the russian lies from hillary clinton and justice department fbi proven hillary and democratics paid the lies impeachment 1 and impeachment 2 all lies now hillary and jill biden with this corrupt justice department making up bullshit to stoptrump i pray to god we will get justice hillary needs to pay for destroying america and if the so called journalists at cnn and other outlets have any dignity or feelings for whats right help save america 18 million illegal criminals coming into our country is on purpose to destroy america for hillary clinton to get revenge open your eyes people please
the government can convict a grape for falling off the vine
im not gonna lie finna start getting prepared for war and a great depression trump getting framed
and trump thought he would be found innocent next thing trump will say that the jury was paid to find him guilty trump really believes that he is above the law poor sap he forgot to come home from fantasy island the plane boss the plane
i was expecting a ah ah ah at some point
this was a political prosecution an aversion to democracy it is a sad day corrupt prosecuters thanks to bidens judicial system
the bests new of the year no boty is over the law god bless america
now what we really and truly need is for donald j trump to be thrown into prison immediately for his crimes we dont need him to remain free while he appeals this for years and years and years and drag this on for years and years and years while he stays free and still campaigns as president that would truly be a travesty trump is guilty he needs to be incarcerated immediately not a slap on the wrist not home confinement still living the life of luxury tweeting his madness 247 trump is a fcking criminal trump is a fcking traitor now lets punish this criminal and traitor immediately the way he should have been punished long ago
as they used to sayhiphiphorayyyyyyy
the simplest answer is usually the correct one now what do you think is more likely the whole world is wrong and they just do not like trump because they are prejudiced or is it more likely that trump is simply a slimy criminal and that that fact has now been proven and the criminal donald trump has finally been found accountable for his crimes that is of course the more likely and correct answer how can trumps supporters believe that the entire world is prejudiced against trump for absolutely no reason at all that is sheer stupidity the correct answer is that donald trump is a slimy criminal and traitor and he is finally going to be made to pay for all of his crimes thats the true answer
we all know that this criminal will appeal all convictions we must insist as one voice that he be placed in custody and held without bond through the appeals process he is found guilty of 34 felonies a known flight risk and now because of his compromised nature an extreme security risk to the united states of america no excuses we want donald trump behind bars now
if this idiot doesnt see jail time there is something seriously wrong with the us justice system
i wonder if trump wasnt running for president if this trial would have even taken place
we still want him as president the last 3 former presidents did more crimes than trump
this was the plan all along to make t the nnext prez
he still gonna win
trump isnt it past your jail time
welcome to prison trumplow
now take the biden family to court and broadcast it for the next few years
as if there was a doubt that this show was going to have any other outcome what a travesty
wwiii is right around the corner and they will bring back the draft because enlistment rates are at a all time low biden voters should be drafted 1st this is what you voted for
and they thought that january 6th was bad
sentenced doesnt mean jail they already explained he likely wont get jail time for this due to his age and no prior criminal history
the heavy democratic control county in america as a jury pool not to mention the activist judge to go along with the da who campaigned on finding a criminal case against president trump sad what democrats leadership has done to america
trump gets convicted and biden gets a free passdoesnt make sense i will never trust the system againthis is wrong what they didthe system is broken forever
if the country allows this verdict to stand we are in trouble as a nation judge should be in jail for prejudice and nut allowing a true defense
the only thing would shame the usa is if he bevomes president
the nexus point
cold champagne and traitor tears its so good i broke out my krazystaw cheers
whether youre left or right today is a sad day for america trump just won the election
everyones guilty
so sad for americatrump2024
america on the road to actually being being great for once
even cnn cant hide the fact that this is bs
so what
cnn cant handle exposing truth on currupt hochul biden friend instanly deleted my other post
this is b
all of yall are so happy but not even realizing that this pretty much sealed the victory for the orange man
trolls look at this clown salivating every time he says guilty what a fool do you think americans care about 12 new yorkers opinions 2024 president will have a fake felony just like cnn fake news pure garbage
cnn and all those with tds may be loving the outcome of this trial but with dr dershowitz former harvard law professor emeritus and dr turley law professor at georgetown university being democrats and seeing that this trial was a total sham all that judge merchan alvin bragg and the jurors whose names will be posted have done is increased division between democrats and those for america more and more democrats will see that this was a sham trial dr dershowitz stated that even if trump appeals they will find him guilty simply because they are all democrats heres the thing though 1 this was a misdemeanor initially but 2 the statue of limitations had run out on it so whatever guilty verdict was made it was illegalby default this is also from dr dershowitzdemocrat
it took the judge 2 and half minutes to get the verdict and poll all the jurors it took jake tapper 6 minutes to tell us
he going to appeal to the supreme court and you know they already paid off
guilty on all 34 counts donald trump is now a convicted felon
who cares we just need trump to lead the nation vote trump
trump 2024 i will never vote democrat again this is sad
sham trial during election year this political persecution will only help trump win back the white house
a great day for democracy
meanwhile hunter biden ignores his subpoenas from the house and isnt held in contempt cocaine in the white house joe is making millions from the chinese and trump baaaaad sheep
he must be disqualified from office
2 weeks to slow the spread
crazy that there still practically 5050 chance this headass is out pres again
honestly i cam here for the comments bout it
a jury of his peers i seriously doubt he had any peers on that jury
i like candidates who arent convicted felons
sup 34 whole family is that oh fella miza let me know when they put him in chains what you say they might not do that he might just get funds that he wont pay yeah because you will never lock him up even though hes the biggest criminal this plantation you call a country have ever seen hes bigger than gotti hes bigger than the founding fathers hes bigger than jack the ripper and it keeps getting worse and yell would rather watch him do what he does hoping to sit back in the white house then to do something about himhe will always be a stain on the white house
your as evil as joe biden
people in jail are feeling cheated
not even a federal judge not legitimate state court cant charge felony
jesus save these people for they know not that they have sinned bless them with the courage to take off the lenses to free themselves of the evil they do in gods name amen
oh crap now i have to vote for trump how can i possibly miss the opportunity to vote for a convicted felon for president all my life ive voted for unconvicted felons for president 2024 may be my one final opportunity to vote for the real deal
you just got him elected
this is a sad day in american history ill still vote for him for president we should all be ashamed
the united states government has quickly turned into a crooked clown show putin and un have nothing on plugs and the demonrats im ashamed of the current administration prediction if there is so much as a handcuff put on president trump the shiff will hit the fan like never before in the history of the usa hint exactly what china is bribing branden for but hes too dumb and greedy to realize it jimmy carter has a smile ear to ear
what if the supreme court overturns it
totally disgusting
as long as hes racist theyll support him
i loved to hear that from jury
america is officially a banana republic
waiting for epstein island visitors to go to trail oh wait they are all democrats
it starts the civil war soon the new ag will indict obama clinton and biden
man hes in trouble oh boy
cohen brought the house of cards down so far he made trump a felon and took a half billion out of his pocket plus 30 thousand thank you cohen for ur service youve redeemed yourself
whens biden n son gonna be charged
the great pumpkin crapped his pants his xldepends didnt stand a chance so he did a little shuffle and he did a little dance melania stayed home and packed her bags for france
they flush the commode on him
first time in a long time i believe americans will not allow this weaponized rigged biden judicial system that is obvious prevail while our country is being invaded by illegal immigrants on bidens open border plan putting america and americans last americans know the world was much more peaceful under trumps leadership and there was no inflation everyone was much better off and america was much more safer he protected this country fiercely and it showed americans know biden can not beat trump at the ballot box so he is resorting to third world dictatorship tactics that are disgraceful biden is in 5th stage of 7 stage dementia how long can they keep injecting him with drugs that last about two hours before a speech looks like even the dope they are giving him is not working as well after his speech in pennsylvania pitiful
democrats maybe useless at governing america but they sure know how to persecute political opponents
joe biden will be found guilty once hes not president democrats just opened pandoras box dont think republicans wont do the same to dem politicians in the future
donald j rump convict
there is a god thank you to the jurors
yesss donniethefelon
wow i knew he was going to be found guilty before the trial ever started i must be psychic like they say what doesnt kill you makes you stronger isnt it obvious what they are trying to do eight years of kicking and hes still here now thats what tough is lets go brandon
well as jimmy kimmel said according to trump they would have found mother teresa guilty of banging stormy daniels
all democrat jurors gee imagine that
let the cases against clinton obummer and biden and hillary begin
soros court is fake and manufactured
wait i didnt quite catch itdid you say he was found guilty of a felony for falsifying business records and was the jury of his peers very unclear
all political its a joke looking forward to voting for trump in november go trump
i am a never trumper i didnt vote for trump in 2016 or 2020 i will in 2024 you cannot jail your political opponents and say that you stand for democracy
in a way this has really helped all the republicans running as 7 democrats i know feel if the democrats will come after trump they will come after anyone they are 7 people of 4 races and their families agree if this keeps up those 7 will have many many more that say the words that best describe it never again will we vote democrat thank you cnn for your hate that is allowing new republicans to come out
he was found guilty for the same reason oj was found innocent jurors were scared
this is the funniest trial ever democrats are so scared of this man that they cant find a real way to stop him meanwhile they are destroying the country and no one goes after them i really hope he goes after all these crooks when he is president
for all yall thats excited do you even know who your next president will be
and he will only be sentenced to probation and fined this wont change the minds of his sycophantic base trump is only going to cry out that the trial and charges were all a sham and his prosecution has all been staged to cheat him out of being president which his moronic base will believe while the documents case which by any metric should actually put trump being bars is being slowly snuffed out
justice will be served in november
just because left liberals weaponized are government and judges to go after trump doesnt mean he j guilty because the left have weaponized their partners to go after trump and thats the only reason that hes guilty if you bring in every left liberal and use taxpayers money to do abuse them of wrongdoing you will find something against them specially if they weaponized judges lawyers even the state that is being traded they will find him guilty and we know that biden obomahillarynancy schumer and the rest of the left are guilty 100 percent
you got trumped
cnn is trash fake news
long overdue for this snake oil salesmen traitorcudos to the jurors
this is progressive we all should vote for the first felon nominee to be progressive well now we must wait the appeal
and just like that hes has my vote
trump 2024 fjb and the whole machine
must be a good day for democrat corruption fraud fear and interference democrat judges democrat prosecutors democrat juries trying to decide americas elections weve seen a few democrat wins where they seem to celebrate through their media but strangely not popular in more public settings sorta like a beijing biden regimes election authority being more of an historic disgrace than any legit leadership
say yha so say you all 34 times guilty
finally about time this fraud be accountable for his actions
politicians spend 4 years chasing and convicting a man not in office anymore but they dont care about the open boders and letting all kinds of immigrants come in with wide open doors
corrupt officials of the court are out of controlthey are just making up false charges for a jury paid by the dems to do so this is 100 anti american and treason against america by the lefts puppets any questions about election interference nowthis is clearly election interference being carried out by the biden administration puppet brigade
how is hush money to a whore a felony but crossing border and not getting charged for anything fascist folks banana republic no more fair elections
oh surprise said no one selective prosecution is persecution of a political rival
welcome to the nazi states of america all politically motivated by the democratic nazi machine
all right murica time to prove to the world that justice for all you preach really works put his fat in jail also now that youve tested the water with this porn hush money trial lets get on with the other more serious federal and state georgia criminal charges
this is sad how much more please him along
it was a huge win for trump and team
i hope trump gets on you tube to find out what average sane people think of him thank you 12 people who have restored my faith in the unitedstated of america i love you
i guarantee that nothing will happen this is just a waste of taxpayers money
did donald trump steal the 2016 election with this scheme to bury another sex scandal right before the election you betcha bigly
bs when ny is allowing muslim community patrols to go on and idiots find trump guilty sounds like there are bigger issues to worry about why isnt that being reported on
these jurors are not his peers the judge is corrupt and compromised for the democratic party this is anti american
so with any case that takes place in court it sets what is called a precedent so what does this mean for the rest of america it means that if you have ever made even the most minor mistake on a piece of paper you could be convicted of a felony now and now the game begins if you hate trump and you made a mistake on any legal piece of paper or document your life will become a living hell if you are 40 years old and you made a mistake at age 18 on some paperwork you will have the opportunity to have multiple counts of felony charges just like trump it could be the most minor of mistakes but it will count as a falsifying documents charge
doesnt matter the left has to keep trump on the ballot they have no choice he will win the primary and then they will put him under house arrest hell run the country as a criminal if he wins because the idiot leftists are too afraid of a free election and they arent convincing anyone opposed of anything
34 counts all guilty
feelings of sadness we are not much different from the bananas republics in central america if he is guilty joe biden and the other four presidents should be taken into custody for their crimes god bless america all i can say is good luck because well need it
about time
bullshit trump 2024
golden shower shoes incoming
omg how much more of this bull crap gulity of whatis there no hope god help us this country is crumbling we need n honest president n they wont let us have onethe ppl spoke n the democrats dont care
on all 34 counts he should serve some timeno one should be above the law jail him too and take him off the ballot hes a criminal two vote blue and lets get honest people on the ballot
straight bullshit trump 2024
everything in trumps life says jail
lmao jake ya could have just said guilty on all counts would have saved us all a lot of time there
they should all expect to be brought up on real charges soon starting with biden
and i will still vote for him over that joke in office right now
thank you my lord it is a very bright day for americans
thank you for making sure donald trump will win in november
all this should have been done long ago he should have been convicted for all those people he has not paid to build the casinos i hear some words of wisdom for anyone who feels inclined to vote for him because they believed in him any president that has ever been president that their state does not carry them to an election has never been a good person nor president
i think we have something much bigger to worry about like a biological weapon they unleashed on us they killed my uncle in the hospital and nearly killed me not only did i lose a crap load of money but i almost died im pretty sure it was an attempted murder by poison by the chinese government or the american government while going to the drive through every time i went there and the money changer seen me she went to the back to do god knows what literally a couple hours later i felt weak and heavy without any energy on a cool halloween day then gain 3 months later the exact same thing visiting the exact same place and the exact same thing she left her position at the register to do god knows what and bam i got covid again we have bigger threats than a former presidents taxes this is distraction to keep our eyes off of the killing of tens of thousands of palestinians
shows zionist rule the usa
a joke without a doubt this case is an easy appeal everyone can see it even the leftist media looks shocked lol the agenda is slowly disintegrate trump
these were the best jurors ever
all this politician like marco rubio and the speaker are playing with heart and soul of america they are destroying the only thing that bond the united states of america and the respect that the whole world have for the us the law the belief in the judiciary system history will tell the us before trump and after tump very sad see the usa getting destroyed from within
happy gilmore aint gonna be shit afterwords
hooorayyy 34chargesfelonmoveon trumpguilty
oh st woooah i def didnt expect this i figured hed skate by dude is a felon now take that donnie woo
my biggest fear is how dumb and divided america looks to the world easy targets for extremism may god bless america
shocker ny soros backed da with a ny corrupt commie judge with a ny left wing jury i take what is election interference for 500 alexlol what a corrupt judcial system
biden and his son soooo innocent
im surprised you dont have the chat turned off because you communists suck january 20 2025 reconing have a nice day
be ready for the financial slap on the wrist hell recieve followed by no jail time and his next presidency
these 12 jurors are american heros
jail time dt
so when can we put hillary obama hunter and joe in the stand for thier crimes
its now official he is a criminal and a traitor
john trump junior for president matter of fact the trump family for the next 30 years for president
good job cnn your puppet musters successfully driving us all to hell you want proof just look at corrupt power around the country as well as all the wars around the world
this idiot wants to get rid of the constitution because he wants to be a dictator however what a hypocrite hes trying to utilize it right now
nt do the crime if you cant do the time
praise god hes making america great for the very first time in history america you are rising back up and us democrats are determined to protect our free way of life so you losers can finally get lost
paying a prostitute not to ruin your life is a felony slaughtering thousands in the name of bb while being led around by the easter bunny nothingburger
well trump is bringing all the corruption out thats why they are doing this they dont want him to be president but he will probably win the election
lets see democrat court democrat jury who would have thought any other outcome
guilty on election interference in the 2017 election
this trial is just as botched as the oj simpson murder trial
the kangaroo court the country has become a joke
in brooklyn new york they was hidden tunnels with a bloody bed what happened to that
whod have thought trump would be convicted by a democrat jury in a democratic city with democrat judge whose own daughter is fundraising off this trial that a trial was even possible because democrats passed the law that extended the statute of limitations to bring a suit against trump can you not see the political partisan bias around this whole trial
nobody is above the law nobody
that judge most to be paid pretty good
how in the world can anyone convicted of a felony run for presidentthis is crazy
america has fallen
and even with that this clown can very well become the first convicted felon to be nominated president of the united states if you do not vote just assuming he will lose
you are beautiful sarah i am so happy merry christmas everyone
so he should go to jail right id be going to jail if i was guilty of just one felony
the whole crowd answered let the responsibility for his death fall on us and on our children
fec doj and irs all said years ago there was nothing there and dismissed these charges this is a clear case of election interference by corrupt democrats who are terrified
thats no life long republican thats a tricky biden supporter probably a friend from delaware where biden is bribing everyone with goodies before the election
bullshit this is pure witchhunt fjb
the event is near
thank god that should let the air out of his tires found guilty of 34 felonys trump a convicted felony no real surprise but amazing hes not getting away scott free with breaking the law the sad part is he can still be president and wipe his record clean
is rhis one case or 34 cases did he do the alleged falsification 34 times to stormy 34 times wasnt she already awarded are taxpayers paying again for this paper tiger trial something isnt right with this story
this doesnt change a thing he is still going to win
whats funny he can still run even as a felon
the only real possible justice would be a minor fine and perhaps only 6 more years as president instead of for life
dont love trump but liberals are losing touch with reality im still happily voting conservative for the first time this year trump for president
lol does he cap about that bull shit
my question is will he serve time or get a slap on the hand
trumpdid make america great again with his wsupremacy
lock that motherfer up forever
guilty yippeee
and yet crackhead hunter biden lies on gun form which is a automatic felony and has yet to see court hilary deletes thousands of emails amd gets a ambassador killed and never charged guess yiu just gotta be a democrat to get away with crimes
hes going to appeal like always he still wont get jail time we all know this
he is not going to jail because he was a president
trump was absolutely railroaded by a sham joke of a justice system disgraceful
where was this case held at again
so a pornstar gets her pay load
for all the people that thinks this is a good thing watch what will happen to our economy from now and on not that i liked trump but he was our only best bet
so jury system sucks when oj was found not guilty and when trump was found guilty those are the only times the jury system didnt work ok i got it now
about time now when is he going to prison so i can dance the jig in the streets
our 2025 president has 34 felony charges
a disgraceful historic moment thanks to republicans can we be done with him yet
made my day champagne bottles popping nite if celebration
and he is still walking the streets dam you would have thought he would have followed the law since he was so adamant about locking hillary up what a bad dude the white supremacist couldnt save him in nyc
sickest thing to ever happen in this country the corruption of the justice system in new york
trump is currently being measured for a custom made orange jumpsuit make criminals accountable again
he cant even vote now lmao
so this is law and order whos next peoples they have a taste of blood they wontt stop here
fucking bullshit
so our past president is a convicted felon and our current president is an unconvicted felon bend over people if they can use the entire crooked criminal justice system to get trump it will be easy to get any of us for spitting on the sidewalk likes 69 k at this time and probably as many dislikes but we will never know
so does this mean joe biden won the office by default
it comes to show that you having a good lawyer can help you have 34 guilty counts and get away with all of this with no jail time or probation
there goes our boarder there goes our country ai will end up controling all of us and taking away all or most of our jobs with corruption at the highest level bible prophecy is right going right on as predicted
rip usa
i will only vote for convicted felons from now on
so what youre telling me is that a guy is getting convicted of a crime that was supposedly not even said in the courtroom by a judge and buy a jury the judges daughter has gotten 180 million from democrats yeah so he should be recused and then the da walked into the courtroom to try to intimidate the jury basically saying yeah you dont commit them i know who you are and ill come after you this will all go into appeal and well get thrown out because of the fact that the judge is absolutely need to recuse himself because of his daughter also the judge didnt allow the fec expert to take the stand and testify so youre charging somebody with fec crimes and youre not allowing an expert in the fec to testify it sounds kind of wishywashy to me or maybe it was because that expert was going to show that there was no crimes
lock him up please
and theyre prepared to file all these charges again and take him back to court when he files appeals
hey hillary and sleepy joe what about you youre next up right nah of course not cause youre probably behind some of this bull ish the country will remain in its current phuckery state what are you gonna do absolutely nothing oh wait you havent since you went in salute to you for jacking it all up
best day since my children were born
thank you lord
we the american people president trump were with you we know this is bogus we know this is one of those bidens move let me speak for allamericans we are with you
we love respect honor and appreciate donald trump as our president of the united states of america with biden s money deals with communist china and hoarding his garage full of classified documents when he had no rights to them at all we witness trump being treated like this the entire world now knows the corruption and weakness of our country with the biden administration and the state of ny biden administration is responsible for the great divide of people now we add the division of the states corruption grows we believe in trump he is a true american today and tomorrow maga 2024 he came forth for we the people we asked for him we still want trump with or without a demo gone demon a traitor or a biden whos been hidden or a puppet on a string whether its in his basement at the beach or an ice cream shop we are now the laughing stock of the entire world and all its weaknesses have surfaced by lowlifes god is watching judgement day is for all not just trump the good shall prevail democrats have no limits as to how far they will go to keep a republican from returning to office their goals of selling us out are still in progress they have been trying to ruin trump for over 8 years now fearing he will expose their corruption and put them behind bars we as a nation will not fall demos gone demons go to h
ofcourse he is convictedthis was the bidens trump card this is the fraud continuation from 2020but keep in mind trump is always 2 steps ahead democraps will fail and fail badly
oh goodie were on the way to making and keeping america trumpless again vote blue and keep that lunatic out of our precious white house
trump wethepeople passtheword passthewordkjb trump2024
cnn acting like they didnt know what the verdict was going to be before the trial started classic cnn bs
you shouldve done what bill clinton did after monica got given a government job to keep things quiet after he got caught lying to the people about getting head in the oval office
fake fake fake fake
finally expresident donald trump is just like any citizen found guilty of all charges i hope they will put him to jail he may probably look good in orange
george washington and the signers of the declaration of independence were also deemed guilty criminals by the opposition
comment if you like trump
a well deserved justice no one not even a former president should be allowed to commit any form of crimes all are under the rules of law
i guess doing something bad or illegal only comes to light when joe biden needs to win yall are blind asf
lock him up
he can still run for president though stop crying
dont waste your money going to law school make up your own rules
put the idiot in jail for 20 years and do not let him run for president
its about time hes held accountable for his crimes hes been dodging and blaming other people for his crimes for years i had hi hopes but never thought it would happen ya hoo
i will still vote for him in nov even if hes sitting in a jail cell so with all this trash it isnt gonna work
im on the toilet giving birth to a democrat
this is the worst country to live in sad i was born here in this world of bullshit america is a 3rd world country now trump leave him slone go for the worst people but no they go for trump saad day
they better pray he never becomes president or they all screwed
what a joke payback is a bitch biden trump 24
its a sad day for sure in our nation but i have to say that the jury did their duty to our country republicans have been hadbad by the former president hes been a fake all his life from fooling the faithful to foolin the fans snake oil salesman is all he is he told everyone that in the beginning
go after trumps enablers those are the criminals trump is just a useful idiot an asylum is where trump should be not proson
we differently will win on his appeal
and once again criminals should not be on the ballot vote blue and make america great again and get rid of all that nonsense that read bought you
all throughout this trial i really thought at best it would be a hung jury i cannot express the level of relief and hope this verdict has given me through these very very very troubling years because of 45 i started to seriously question what america and americans were becoming i thought this is not america and this not how americans are i began to think that maybe i was wrong about that and that we would go the way of how many societies have and become something horrifically unrecognizable i realize that 45 aka bloatbiggest liar of all time will appeal but this verdict is so restorative to my faith in the country and people that i truly treasure we really are better than what the almost decade of 45s presence has indicated now the only thing is to ensure that that pathetic wannabe dictator fraudulent and lying pos never ever gets near the oval office go democracy long live a free america
i honestly dont believe you can find enough people for a jury in nyc smart enough to even understand his charges or the complexity of the bs theyre trying on him
the crooked goverment is being supported by criminal minds who hate america voting trump
trump is guilty as sin trump for prison 2024
i think we already found out we are living the consequences of a rigged system with biden in charge your telling us stuff we already know trump2024
if trump isnt on the ballot he will be the first write in candidate to win the presidency
look at all the lawless scumbags who shout acab and fly blm flags outside their homes cheer that a man was just found guilty by the same system they have zero trust for hilarious
take down the statue of liberty this is no longer america we are a fullblown banana republic
why not make it a even 100
hes a stain on americas underwear
we know this wont change the election at all his supporters wont care even if he shoots people on 5th ave so whats next why do we even bother to allow someone who doesnt even promise to play by the rule of the election into the election in the first place
this will be overturned on appeal
wwiii is right around the corner and they will bring back the draft because enlistment rates are at a all time low biden voters should be drafted 1st this is what you voted for
trump 川普 2024 all the way
this is what happens to naysayers who go against the nwo rip america
justice shall prevail
how much did it cost new york to pay all these juriors off for working in a kangaroo court
its a day to celebrate too bad this isnt the end of having to hear about trump
good day for dems horrible day for the us with the entire world laughing at usconvicting a former president does not look good no matter the situation and here come the comments
dont you go to jail when convicted you know hand cuffed taken by bailiff to booking put in cell remanded until sentenced or is that just for us poor folk
sad day in the us
and the farce continues law used as a weapon appellate actions will be interesting
wonder if it will be a 34 dollar fine and slap on back of hand or given the key to nyc
ya know the aclu is constantly running ads on tv wanting money where are they at or are they nothing but frauds
so he must pay a zillion dollars
those are all misdemeanors what was the linking crime statute to upgrade those to a felony
lol at headline hey cnn you left off at the end convicted by a biased democrat donating judge and a jury of democrats nice try though
of all the dirty crap the clintons and bidens have done it should be clear to anyone who is honest and with half a brain that this has been purely political how shameful this can happen in the us
theyre trying to block his election cant you people see whats going on
just a total travesty and you wonder why people dont believe in the system anymore
funny how trump can get convicted of a crime that michael cohen admitted to doing himself what a complete shit show
it was not a jury of his peers there are prodemocratic party jury that was threatened if they found him not guilty and this was definitely reason for the democratic party to try and influence the election that judge needs to be prosecuted as well as the district attorney
cnn has the daunting task of protecting pedophiles at all cost that must be exhausting
glory be
thats what anyone would get for trying to expose the corruption in our government
i will vote for a convicted fellow in november trump2024
best day in america history
there is no justice system anymore in the united states it has come down to do what i say or else you had teachers lawyers l professional people on that jury and lawyers oh did i say lawyers
i love trump even more cant wait for our first felon president hes gonna break that glass ceiling lol trump 2024
such bullshit
cnn is a joke they know this trial was corrupt and chose to ignore it
the democrats are having a orgasm right now but i feel it will be taken to a higher court and overturned
cohens having a great day
biden knew he was going to lose this was his only choice
what bs
fantastic this will guarantee trump is our next president fjb fkjp
but biden is elderly man with limited memory so he will not be charged for any crimes he has done nor obamas nor bushes or clintons specially wifey nor crooked insideer trader pelosi people need to wake up
literally proven to be criminally dishonest yet hes still gonna have people voting for him at some point they have to realize how stupid they look right like how do you spin this in a positive way how can you honestly think to yourself yeah this complete convicted fraud is who i want in charge of the country
34 times is kinda a lot i couldnt get away with it once
to be continued
congratulations democrats you just sealed his victory in november when trump wins this in appeals this will be a complete waste of money and all for nothing congratulations you just played yourself
lock him up
this is what we call fafo glad justice is still alive in america
if biden and the democrats can do this to a president trump they sure he can do it to you
thank you democrats for the great defeat in novemberwhen a democrat will not be winning the presidency
cnnfake news and the us medias are making the country destroyed one day when the us became another communist china all the people who have supported joke biden and believed the stupid cnn will know how you lose your freedom because of your own stupidity
team blue is full of sheep as they sell out the greatness of our country
this is a political persecution against trump this is incredible in this country
this is all bullshit we latinos are still voting for trump no matter what
great america is going down the toilet with biden in charge longer better buy guns and ammo to protect yourself and your family
ridiculous on to the supreme court and trump now has my vote
well lets be real he did it so this makes sense
falsifying business records in the first degree in furtherance of election interference in 2016 convicted felon donald trump republican candidate for president cheated in 2016 by falsifying business records in the first degree
lock him up and while youre at it lock up little donnie jr eric and lara
just a biden buying votes
you this is just fuel for a reelection right
trump 2024 it was a scam of a trail our for fathers warn of this type of goverment
woo hoo finally
this is one of the happiest days of my life im so happy now im going to sit back and continue to watch trumps dimise its been proven in a court of law by a jury of his peers that donald j trump is a disgusting pathetic treasonous traitor who has no redeeming qualities period
the country will be safe again when trump is sent to jail and serve a long jail sentence
american just got great again
hihi big theater in america vote for bidden bidden is the best president
no true american believes that
hallelujah its a great day for america the traitor in chief ex prez is guilty as charged lock him up already
you should be ashamed of your network cnn you should thank donald j trump thats he is the only way you get ratings up stupid misinformation news broadcast corrupt bastards
trump was right no other president has done more for this country than me unfortunately the more is all bad like committing crimes lol
if he doesnt go to jail the justice system is broken if any other us citizen convicted of 34 felonies we would do jail time even the staunchest trump supporter has to agree
so a felon cant vote but can still run for president wow its time to allow past felons the right to vote
the fact that no cameras were allowed in the courtroom is proof trump is treated with kid gloves the fact he isnt already in prison even more proof this pos has bended and manipulated our judicial system in ways none before him have he deserves the most severe punishment possible by law f maga
why do more people hate trump for who he is rather than biden for who hes not
he cant vote now now is pelosi et al going to be prosecuted for insider trading
was there any other outcome in this liberal court
finally trump is held accountable for some of his lifelong crime spree
every developer in new york has just been put on notice the average person has no idea how damaging this case is to the future of the city
can cnn spell fire extinguisher
now he should damn well spend time in jail starting right away
to be honest im quiet surprised that he has been found guilty of all charges and that gives me strong hope in the future this man is a well known crimial and should treated as such hopefully his campaign will stop sometimes soon and leave the place to another republican gop if you waited for a moment to change now is the time
now dumbasseswhat was his crime this man just told you 34 times what the crime is so get over that rhetorical question
draining the swamp
we must stand together now every night at 6pm sound your car horn 3 times until november 5th this could be the start of patriots uniting peacefully
justice is served
it was like music to my ears
rule of law
found guilty on all counts by a jury of his peers people cant wait to hear how alina haba and all the rest of the pieeyed maga true believers are going to spin this
lock him up immediately
what happened i must be behind on the times
we now live in a third world country
if person with a single felony cant vote why someone with multiple felonies qualifies to run for president
cant wait to see those poll numbers climb even higher
yeah i mean i buy that he did it but so many businessmen and politicians do stuff like this then get away on technicalities but him they decide to crucify never was a big trump fan but going to be voting for him out of pure spite now this is the biggest political witch hunt since the republicans went after bill over every single little thing they could
in the immortal words of ice cube today was a good day
this is why donald j trump will be our next president america knows the truth
none of it matters trump 2024 maga
ef you are a demonrat you cand be above the law
trump will be the president and no corrupt judge will block that that trial was a total joke trump will appeal and win this only will solidify the will of the american people people will vote for trump like never before
your out bye trump
well now ill be voting for trump
total bullshit
congrats obiden you still wont beat him trump 2024
how much did they pay these jurors
lol trump cant vote for himself lol
didnt cohen get caught lying
is he able to run for president after the verdicts
now the steal is really going to be on now he got no choice but to steal the election
91 34 57 more guilty verdicts to go
today is a good day for the usa no one is above the law we just need to see how much his privilege is going to help him during sentencing stay home in jail would be a disaster this asshole needs to go to jail even if the secret service needs to go in with him or removed as his personal security team
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssss jfc its a party in the usa
this is bogus the judge probably has done worse those without sin let them step forward
this bullshit was rigged from the judge all the way down m
why cant a convicted felon vote but a felon could run for the highest office

dang trump they trying to nail you
trumpo the clown guilty
i know you all at cnn are popping bottles congrats

nelson mandela was convicted still became president of south africa i feel like this american story will have a similar outcome

the revolution has begun
you are so proud of this a corrupt jury filled with democrats two being democrats lawyers hope cnn goes down and never recovers god bless you president trump america is with you we know what these democrats are doing

i think the useless repub should start a campaign of investigating dems for hush money cases
the media so lies
not guilty judge juan merchan is not following the constitution of the united stats these are all bugos sheme
the count from sesame street is losing his mind
i guarantee if you checked all the party affiliations of everybody involved in this court case you would find that the juries is all democrat and the judge is democrat and everybody thats prosecuting donald trump is democrat this is the most horrendous thing i have ever seen in my 70 years of life this is just a political move and it will not work now we may see the wrath of god like you have never seen it on the united states of america and thats what im hoping and praying for because this was the worst thing ive ever seen in my 70 years of life
i am sure in new york it was fairlol
this really only pisses people off more the judicial system is beyond repair at this point and itll take at least 2 decades to rectify and heal blacks browns whites are all for trump good job you opened a can of worms for people who were on the fence trump is 100 winning the election now
trump will appeal then lie his ass off threatening political violence and gaslight like never before he put in the fix with judge cannon because he knows shes in control and no real oversight in florida note that he put the screws to the cases he could really do time over this guy is a straight up career criminal and now an official felon trying hard to be the dictator of the united states and they will definitely wage a serious problem for decent americans because trumps lies are infused with evil intentions and vengeance
kangaroo court and circus show
this is a disgrace for our country ty for showing us how far this corrupt government will go to try to stay in power you just made trump our president in november trump 2024 time to drain the swamp

that lady porn star did her service and got paid why the hell she is playing victim
oh hell yeah lock him up
the crimes that he is convicted with for those who dont read is business fraud he couldve avoided all of this if he had just paid stormy daniels upfront but since he wanted to do it in such a roundabout way and kept trying to cover his tracks he ended up committing fraud after fraud tldr if you write a check that says for rent and yet use that money for lotto scratchers but then claim you used it for rent guess what you lied
theyre going to let him go because hes a white boy
all this does is make me dig even deeper in my account and donate to republicans the liberals will of course cheer for now but be very careful of pushing conservatives too far with injustices like this
heres to 4 more years of funding wars that have nothing to do with the us taxpayers woohoo
the usa has become a 3rd world country
hitler was locked and won so trump has a chance they are both the same

this country is so fucked
australians will not let a convicted person stand for an elected position in fact even being charged would be enough to get you disqualified whats beyond strange is that trump is still likely to stand for election and further that cannon down in florida seems to be putting him above every other citizen how is any of this possible in what pretends to be a democracy
ohhhhhhhhhhh guilty thank you new york me and my family will celebrate
isnt it coincidental all these court cases are popping up in an election year
trump just won the election
corruption at its core sorry ass people
anyone who believes in our judicial system you are a fool im not pro trump or pro harrisbiden but our system is damn joke
the economy in the shape its in because of the new york stock exchange turning tricks with hookers and snorting cocaine they two falsified records and not one of them was found guilty and president trump is found guilty

the us is a failed state

now kennedy popularity will sky rocketi will repeat this and i mean it with all my heart if biden is reelected the united states is finished
today democratic corrupt justice system and corrupt judge who gave his own criminal injustice instructions to jurors making it impossible for fare due process is criminal its far from over appeals to come trump2024
bro the fact that cohen lied on the stand and admitted to stealing 30k from trump is wild and trump still got convicted our country is run by democrat dictators and ripping this country apart from the inside out
the media and the judges are as corrupt as joe biden and his cronies they are all trying to demolish this country want to take your freedom youre guns youre money f all these people
worts day in us history democrats are corrupted
did anyone expect anything different in new york and of course cnn has to read all 34 to try to make a biased point this whole thing is bllsht and everyone knows it and everyone knows it will be overturned on appeal but you have your talking point now well see how far that gets you
trump 2024 you war mongers have fun going to war with russia you do realize we have a thing called the draft

heres something that i dont understand we hear in america will ground our children as a form of discipline to show them that there are consequences for their bad acts for not following the rules if you will not just outside the home but within the home we try to be fair with our discipline so it makes no sense to me it never has and it never will make sense to me that the very people that support donald trump will ground their own kids to show them that they have to pay consequences when they dont follow rules but they are p because donald trump has to answer too and pay some sort of consequences for his bad acts and not following the rules so it makes no sense to me it never has and it never will make sense to me that the very people that support donald trump will ground their own kids to show them that they have to pay consequences when they dont follow rules but they are p because donald trump has to answer too and pay some sort of consequences for his bad acts and not following the rules
donald trump just won the presidency
true patriots found the corrupt traitor stinky don guilty don on all 34 charges ill bet his maga mushheaded supporters are having an epic pity party
so he didnt ruin the country its all personalgood to knowwake me up when you find a crime against america electioninterference
this is music to my ears finally some accountability this is a beautiful day for this nation
more complete bullshit all be overturned by a real court not a democrat party
what a
whats odd is 0 humans can apparently name the actual crime that was committed not the judge prosecutor or jurors it would be comical if it happened in some other country guess well see what the red state attorney generals decide to do in response
what is hilarious is that trumps support website is down due to the number of people sending donations but more than anything else bragg and others have not figured out what they have done they just set a precedence now obama clinton biden can be charged and tried for their crimes but their crimes are real with serious penalties
complete fucking sham bullshit kangaroo court fuck the left wackos
maga2024 full speed ahead
sad day for this country a true banana republic
is he going to jail
you do realize you just handed this man the presidency
guiltysuprise suprise supriseas if you didnt know going in that no matter what the defense presented he was going to be found guilty of everything including spitting on the side walk well see what the appeals court finds this was a show kangaroo trial and most americans who are not rabidly anti trump know that if anything this will make him even stronger
he never actually committed any crimesomebody with deep pockets bought paid for the so called judgeda the jurors no way on this earth did all them 12 jurors find him guilty on 34 counts deep pockets paid them what a dern disgrace
what a total crock it has set a lovely precedent though huh
imagine if they applied the same rules to all the democrats in office right now how much hush money was paid to the judges and lawyers to go through with this the bidens are disgusting criminals all politicians are it only applies to trump because they know if he runs again theres a 0 chance of biden winning
i will now be voting for trump i was undecided but this sealed it something just isnt right
you are innocent until proven guilty now you are guilty donald
finally all 34counts i believe that warrants jail time
well that finalizes his victory for presidency this year trump2024 baby lets go
if he doesnt do prison time for 34 felony convictions the judicial system is irreparably broken i did 5 years for 2 nonviolent felonies
since everyone is talking abt trump verdict now isrl is planning to how they can unlive as much innocent people cant get exciting it seems
all this for what lol nothing going to happen he not going to jail and a will be president
this is soo wrong what theyre did trump the jury will pay for what they did to trump i hope the protester goes after themi really do trump is not going to jail this bullshit biden the one that should be in jail go after them protector
the unbelievable thing is how a kangaroo court of the biden admin can do this in the usasad day for america
im still not giving up on trump
i thought coen was the one that took care of the books shouldnt he be found guilty of something
trump is still the best prez always has been always will be and biden and hunter remain without fault
like he was going to get a fair trial in ny the apeal was filed five seconds after the verdict its not the same place it was when the trial started ny dems are fed up with their leaders its going to be a whole different set of eyes looking at the apeal
bs complete miscarriage of justice am definately now voting trump 2024
trump still got my vote and many many others
this is a travesty of justice the fact that he is repeating the same count verbiage individually further cements how ridiculous cnn is and how politically motivated this is democracy is dead under bidens corrupt administration and the democrats machine
travesty and those celebratingwill regret this day
well this makes the 2016 election invalid due to trump committing crimes to win
guaranteed reversed on appeal what a joke
goddamn 34 felonies wont do one day in jail what does it matter really
and this wont take 1 vote from trump
wtf ny communist u happy now
cnn fake news just like how this was a fake trial yall have nothing on the man trump 2024 yall just made the rest of this country go red
fjb i dont care about all you woke democrats fjb donald j trump 2024 he is and always will be our true president
total bs this is a complete sham
regardless of the verdict which i hear in your voice an evil victorious tone with every guilty i want to thank you on behalf of all conservative republicans for your relentless coverage of this bogus trial and subsequent temporary conviction that will be overturned on appeal but either case it is because of the liberal dems that trumps approval and polling are through the roof much better than us on the right could have ever imagined the liberal dems hands down handed trump his reelection come nov 5th 2024 our sincerest thanks for the free publicity through his persecution that we all americans observed the political lawfare that has been continuously used to suppress him but only makes him more desirable trump 2024
im sick of the corruption to what a crock of shit meanwhile biden has sold us out to the chinese while biden supports hamas and iran
trump2024 i will fight for him
welp were screwed
isnt 3 felonys a life sentence without parole so what is he doing out
hatred rules the day and the most powerful force in americalets see what path this takes us downbe proud of yourselves americans for electing a derelict to enhance your hatred towards another personover half of our country wakes daily to see who they can hatecount yourselves successful and remember this time in your lives as the unraveling has begun
a predictable outcome from a partizan court
trump has been cheating and scamming people for decades its about time hes finally held accountable now lets get the other cases to court
this has to be the worst day of democracy ive ever seen
what about all the kids biden has sniffed no hush money there i call bs fjb
goofball has to go thru all 34 lol
look at biden and his chinese coup not going to stop him being president 2024 trump still got my vote trump give hush money to the democrats so they all can shut the f up
such a sad thing joe biden has done to mr trumpi can no longer support the democrats in theyre destruction of our countryi will now reluctantly give my vote for donald trump only because i do not agree with tyranny
this is so vile and jury prob was paid by dems hush money this is corruption at its finest
he has my vote now
dont care if hes a convicted felon im still voting for him felon trump 2024
damn biden is cooked when he gets out of office if this is all it took for trump to get convicted
im on the toilet giving birth to a democrat
al capone 1 felony for tax evasion trump 34 felonies for rounding error
sentence should be longer than his second full termappx 68 months two for each convictionthough i doubt he wins
corrupt judge and court im really voting trump now
rule of law above all
im not saying this man is a saint but this biden thing will not stand with me we are closer to world war then ever and i cant help but think this shit would be different in a more positive way then the sycophants we have in power today
surly a felon cannot run for office correct
hes going to be on probation in his 200 million dollar estate
the victim of an extortionist convicted what a bunch of shit
unfortunately all you guys are doing is helping him and making him more popular
his legal team will definitely appeal this case and they can easily buy time for six or more months where as other cases will not go to trial before the general election so chances are that he will come out ahead and win the election
trump will appeal like he should
im still voting for president trump if his name is on the ballot and if hes not im not voting
not even child sex offenders get this many charges
if the felon has a go at the jury can they sue him
lock him up the evidence was irrefutable it would not be questioned with any other person in america he has been a criminal his entire adult life he was never the person he protrayed on the apprentice that was pure fantasy and that is what mainstream and cnn sell dailycomplete fantasy about a life long cirminal that fact the his worst crimes are being blocked by corrupt judeges that he appointed is traitorous behavior
now send his disgusting ass and face to jail
best news all year
maga is guilty trump is done felony ex con president
so now trump cant vote for himself because of disenfranchisement of convicted felons right
im scared hes will bothering us muslim arabic iraqies
this juryjudge just elected trump congrats

he will be the next president of united states
welcome to communism under the democrat party same think they do in russia
dont think this is gonna stand up on appeal
do not rejoice when your enemy falls and do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles lest the lord see it and it displease him and he turn away his wrath from him almighty god sees all

trump 2024this kangaroo court rigged against trump judge told jury go home talk with your family what real judges say dont talk to anyone talk to their family about the corrupt money put into their bank accounts cnn fake news
we are now no better than any banana republic lady justice has been raped and murdered
no one is above the law and biden your next these crooked politicians if this truly isnt about politics then i except to see mr biden and his brother and son charged they r worst than trump
trump will not sleep well tonight expect a all night truth social rant rage and threats lol
melania must be so proud
seems he is the entire swamp
and with that the usa has officially become a banana republic i was already eager to cast my vote for trump now i am extremely eager
thank you jury for no favor impeached felon and 57 charges to go
when you got individuals like joe biden and donald trump and its your only choice to vote for i mean what do you do nobody else stepping up nobody else wants to nobody else can whatever the reasons are we are looking at it people
find somebody else to replace this idiot for president hes fucked up already
how much did biden pay the jurors
its all bullshit this world is nothing but a joke corruption is all government bullshit
america is already great it shows now we dont need to make it great again
so i guess hes out of the race
and i bet you jack shit nothing happens to him like some protected neanderthal on the conservation list
kudos this corrupt trial has won trump the election wait and see
the democratic party machine seems to have a sinister hold on power of the federal judicial system and new york city judicial system democrats have done a complete disservice to the american people and the systems they once believed in
thats oka cause you liberal democrats will pay for this i cant wait to sit back and watch the repercussions from this
its a sad day in america i have lost my confidence in this country convicting a man for what i believe the jury was handpicked to rule against him there goes our economy and our money
disgusting orgy of corrupt people rigging it from the beginning just wondering what this so called justice system will do to the average citizen now
a misdemeanor elevated to a felony by saying a federal crime that never occurred was covered up we live in a banana republic
takes notes all men and women you will reap what you sow
and still there is no defined crime im an independant im voting donal j trump as of now
democrats feel that in order to save democracy they must destroy democracy what a shame maybe the democrats should try sound policy instead of election interference get your popcorn ready folks what is good for the goose is good for gander joe and other swamp creatures will have their day soon enough we the people will make it so
finally law and order prevail king rat goes to prison the people are not stupid long live the rule of law and democracy
so what are the sentencing guidelines id like to see him taken into custody and lock him up
hell lose some vote from the moderates of his party and some of the independents that might have voted for him but just like his gag order violations ten he will not likely spend a day in jail thanks to our twotiered justice system
yawn as an independent who watched this trial from beginning to end i think ive decided on voting for trump such a sham i bet not a single person here can show me the damning evidence the proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty in case anybody says im just a trump supporter i voted for obama and biden
trump is so tired of all this winning
i was here
this country is now officially one big sad joke
our country is in so much trouble and you fools are too full of hatred to see it very sad and scary times we are in the party wont hesitate to come for you just keep that in mind
i hate you and everyone at cnn
only in the republic ny total bs and the rest of the world knows it
wow the paid russian trolls are awfully quiet today lol
trump just won the election
look at all this winning
i dont drink but i think im gonna go out celebrating tonight
cnn can kiss my ass you people are just as crooked as crooked joe
here comes the appeal
trump is sentenced to 4 years in the white house
new yorkers zuck
we love you trump
this is not good news trump found guilty biden has done worse treason but biden will go free what kind of justice is that are you happy now joe i bet you cant wait to get to the microphone
what about all the other presidents that has done wrong even the president we have now
enjoy it while you can children ithey will throw out the charges on appeal
everyone who is happy smiling and cheering are exactly why this country is in the toilet its okay though hell pardon himself in january when hes sworn back in office
found guilty 34 times in 11 hours pity hell never see a jail cell
all he has to do is pay them goos
i just donated to the trump campaign
let this sink in according to 10 usc 504 any person who is a convicted felon is prohibited from enlisting in any military service
not his peers his peers already said hes not guilty these are demons
wont change anything potatojoe still gonna lose to this clown good job dems
all of this could have been avoided if repubs had voted honestly when they impeached him the first time
now do something about it
you just declared war on the american people then war you shall have
still voting trump in nov 2024 you just made trump a martyr for the cause of saving america from corruption you big dummies
can anyone tell me what exactly he did with his money he got charged for spending money i dont get it
sad day for america the dems will turn this country to new russia
i dont believe anything this a hole says
i will take a felony rather than a corrupted nancy or brain dead joe thanks
and your reward is 4 more years of a dementia patient
this a good day for america
the corrupt judge and jury were going to convict trump whether he was innocent or guilty trump got fuck by satanists you tardos won the battle but god and his warriors will win the war bank on it
congratulations for convicting a presidential canidate to elimanate the opposition we have now officially become a dictatorship country
guilty of all 34 charges yes con man traitor is guilty
bullshit trump is innocent
make america great again
great news for america the usa cant have this thug return to the white house he would put the country at risk
fact hillary clinton and obama both have been guilty of using campaign funds illegally let that soak in they were guilty they just got slapped with a fine if this is not the prime example of a two tiered imbalanced justice system i dont know what is wake up people this is corruption
we are now south africa stand by
amazing what happens when you do not permit a defendant to present a defense
about time the law catches up to him
420 a felony is a felony it doesnt matter if its a big felony or a little felony if a low level felony disqualifies me from working at a bank then it definitely should disqualify me or anyone from being president of the united states
prepoll rigging we are becoming a banana republic with kangaroo courts this is what happens in 3rd world countries
these jurist didnt have any guts they didnt understand what they were doing they asked for the instructions and the corrupt judge would not let them see the written instructions or they can ask questions this is not over yet and anybody who thinks it is let me hold my tongue so youtube doesnt kick me out of here
coke head hunter runs free seems fair right
total bullshit gi get hunter and the big guy
and yet he can still run to become the next president of the us as a convicted felon
this is history
leave this man alone wtf
what a sad day for our country
a criminal with body guards paid by gov i think he can be a worse criminal now
im happy hes been found guilty again but will he serve time he has a bunch of nuts that still want this jackass as a president even though he is incapable of telling the truth
did bill clinton pay paula jones the 850000 on the books
who cares trump 2024
this is law and order keep this fascist away from a job that can wipe out democracy
wha you gotta be kidding wheres the evidence there is none this is sick
and his poll numbers will soar
justice served
bought and paid for dem jury judge these are all lies going to appeals court and supreme court straight away dems are demons jesus prevails trump 2024 and beyond maga
this injustice just increased his supporters and fired up the voters to make sure djt is elected potus in 2024
what a travesty
trump 2024 lets go
hell yeah lets send billions to support taiwan too
trump finally won the popular vote
communist news network
bided should be pulled into court and the conservatives get to pick the judge and jury what a sham
the evil of capitalism
trump will be the rightful next president on inauguration day 2024
witnesses texts and recordings whod have thought this is just the beginning
what a joke youre all guilty just so ya know u didnt pay taxes on that lamp u bought at a garage sale 9 years ago ago
democrats do not believe in fair elections democrats have now committed political suicide by launching a 2nd civil war the first time democrats wanted to keep their slaves and their power but now its strictly about power
its about timeget rid of this stupid man
and he just won the presidency dems show the world how evil they really are corrupt dems cant stop him deal with it
congratulations on proving how corrupt our justice system has become
did this mean were stuck with biden for another 4 years
all of you are fools
now its bidens turn to be convicted
about time hes held accountable
not one person is going to change their mind about voting for donald trump
man theres gonna be ketchup on the walls tonight
wait what about statute of limitations
how can we allow this man to continue his campaign for president where is the line
sooooo what does this mean for the next election
hell still win the presidency this fall
white people dont go to prison theres two justice systems in america
how much were they paid by the jugethe mose corrupted court in this state
any state that convicted felons cant vote need to take him off the ballot
we need mostly peaceful protest
hillary needs compensation as had the popular vote but lost to this election fraud
lol to all you trump deranged sheep celebrating this just guaranteed trumps victory
is going to become president and you guys are trying everything to stop it
is bill clinton next
donald trump just secured the election today he will be our next president
trump will always be a better pesident then any of them
of course hes obviously guilty lock him up
the fakest trial ever
the first of many convictions to come they have only scratched the surface of his criminal life
his donation center crashed because of the volume of donations coming in as a person of color i feel i can relate to how hes been treated hes a fighter
clarence thomass wife paid for insurrectionists to be bussed to dc remove him from the supreme court sent botch body mtg back to georgia its tome to clean up capital hill
im still waiting on hunter and joe bidens charges oh wait there are none double standards maybe
sham trial will be overturned
all these commenters are the same people who say trumps a tyrant amazing the blinders you guys have on
they really dont want trump to be president again
i hear the democrats are changing their mascot from a donkey to a kangaroo
not one honest person on that
for some reason when trumps picture was being shown and the caption guilty of 34 counts was displayed i kept hearing the theme song for baretta
45 can go home for a longggggg nap
karma is a mf the things that he did to them young boys when they were alleged raping a girl in new york has come home to roost
guys trump will be ok he is still going to win you just showed that the justice system can be weaponized against political opponents as an independent who voted for biden this is an utter disgrace and obvious sign of corruption trump is a piece of shit but that doesnt justify what was done today come back to this comment after the election and read it again after hes won you need the middle to win this is not the way to do it
this is so much validation for the costs and trouble taking him to court justice matters
boy youre all gonna be really mad that you won a battle but when hes president realize you lost the war
trump we the people have your back vote trump 2024 the insurance policy at work lisa page peter struck chuck schumer there is more than one way to hung a dog trump obama get trump at any cost democrats try to get trump off the ballott america the world is watching people why on earth would you vote biden in office for another four years biden is in plain sight showing the world he has dementia cannot dress himself cannot find his mouth eating his icecream how on earth can he represident america
its the only way the democrats could even get close to winning this election and as far as braggs as of now will need more protection than trump and biden combined all the democrats want is the same thing they wanted before when they impeached trump they just want the lure of being able to say that hes a convicted felon he will not only be a convicted felon he will be the first convicted felon to win the presidency unanimously
of coursefound guilty by a jury full of trump hatersa biden supporting judge and a crooked pig of a prosecutorlike bidenthis to will failappeal incomingthe left just shot themselves in the footthey wont feel the pain right away but they soon willfor all their criminal efforts to deny us a vote they will fail and fall hard
i believe i can call him guilty trump or trump the felon or trump the convicted felon
of course hes obviously guilty
did bill clinton pay paula jones the 850000 on the books
i hope hes locked up but l doubt it happens
here people want america to be a third world
it will be overturned on the statue of limitations
hanging jury of democrats by a trump hating judge and prosecutor
he just won the 2024 election thanks biden
and if you think these are the only business records that hes falsified in however long hes been a businessman i have a wall in china that i want to sell you
wellthat was unsurprising and truly irrelevant to anyone who has their mind made up to vote trump into office it may result in some gleefulness by the left but it is irrelevant to half the country and youve now successfully made trump the underdog have you learned nothing sigh
they need to toss his butt in prison
hes not going to jail and can still run for president dont let the liberal media fool you we got this maga 2024
communism at its finest 12 traitors and a corrupt judge and a communist news network good fn grief
don the john the con the felon
this is some str8 bs logging expenditures as legal fees is exactly what you do when you pay a lawyer moreover his accountants do the payments not him directly this whole case was built on nothing more than assumptions and lies we might as well throw out law and civility at this point the dnc are bolshevik tyrants and their followers are indoctrinated pawns this is more reminiscent of the ussr than the usa at this point anybody with a bidenharris sign is fair game they are not humans or country men
this only strengthens trumps case that democrats are nazis he wins you lose cnnsucks
is it possible to appeal
lock his ass up
wonder how much the jurors were paid
its so sad convicted with no crime this will backfire in november
bs go after biden obama and the clintons this is bs if he is guilty for these obama hillary clinton and biden deserve the electric for treason and corruption chair trump 2024
its sad all the sheep in the commnets but im glad you are all still willing to be slaves so i can be free im sure thats over all your heads
and nobody cares about the railroad still voting for him trump 2024
he ia about the most dishonest business human being the country has
biden bot thread biden you will still lose america hates you
wait till trump is president n goes back for all involved these bs charges will get dismissed in a few months watch
trump 2024 what a petty crime trail lmao while biden is funding the war machine
dude really youre just going to read them all in order even though theyre all identical zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
see this is why i dont care for politics u never have a person thats good enough to care for the american people but when u do find someone that does ends up a felon too much corruption everywhere sigh
wow he can count
stalin couldnt be prouder of this star chamber conviction
he will appeal and he will still win the election i will be voting for trump
what the crap biden and pelosi are actually guilty of real crimes
ny is corrupt as hell
so when is clintons trial
sounds good now what will happen anyone else would be sentenced to prison
palestine never existed
the only crime committed was otisville cohen stealing 30000 from president trump
yes past your jail time chump
trump is a legitimate businessman
none of this will prevent him from becoming the next president
america just became communist
lets see who wins in november i cant wait to taste all your leftist tears when donald trump is named the 47th president you will all be able to blame yourselves for him winning people see right thru all of this
okay now that we have trump down can we please investigate how sleepy joe has a 10million dollar net worth making 400k a year as a president we have nowhere near a decent president to elect this next election might as well end the year with a bang
all of this over hush money payments but god forbid you ask about why clinton correspondence are found deceased by self infliction despite the impossibility of the scene presented i love that all of these counts are about financial scrutiny but lord forbid that finger gets pointed at any member of the dnc that doesnt oppose the en masse ideology of the party in question good luck folks
a sad day for trump and therefor the world next south park probably
yeah everybody knew the fix was in a long time ago no surprise bet his poll numbers go up
cnn is bad
at last america stood up for justice god bless america
the self proclaimed genius not a genius in business at all
this shit is becoming frighteningly familiar a political figure goes to jail his followers martyr him making his more powerful then he kills all the jews only now itll be all of latin america
could you draw it out a little motre
next will be biden
fake news dishonest judge
you wouldnt have any news coverage if it wasnt for president trump because thats all you talk about and when you do its all lies

judge merchand has handled all area of this complicated trial with the utmost professionalism honesty and control of the most difficult defendants ever thank you judge merchand for controlling the mostb difficult trials in usa history judge merchand should most definitely be om the supreme court in fact he should be chief justice he knows how to run the court for justice and control
sad day our justice department has been weaponized
34 charges for the same thing
who cares if he paid money to a porn star did he do anything corrupt in his position as president if not then trump 2024
what a sad day for america just another reason for sleepy joe biden to remain at the wheel
strange bill clinton paid paula jones 850000 to go away silently yet there has been no investigation
if jacob is unable to understand the charges falsified business records he is not a bookkeeper wow wtf well half the country will be ecstatic
our country is in for a real awakening we all have buried ourselves may we all go to prison who go against the machine
i should not delight so much but i do karma is a bitch didnt get that memo

makes me proud to be a american again now can we please see him thrown in jail like we would be if we were found guilty remember lady justices is blind so please judge dont take her blindfold off
f yeah higher inflation for the next 4 years i love high interest rates vehicle prices high utilities high groceries and fuel plus the border is being invaded daily

the judge is sold out and corrupt its outgageous for a clerical error if he were a democrat no problem lie steal cheat all good

this will definitely give trump more votes 12 sick democratic jury and judge that makes 13 sick people trump has more than 60 million people behind him and counting

wow demobrats are gullible this verdict was bought before the trial even began not to mention so many rights and the bending of the constitution please it will be overturned all biden and his weaponized administration did was make trump stronger biden you will be in hospice care before november
meanwhile cohen on the prosecution admitted to stealing campaign funds for his personal use

all of you are fools if you think this is a good thing you have no respect for this country or what it stands for we are doomed as a country
lmao the dems are going to be running scared after the nov elections
mr trump i am sorry this country has persecuted you at every turn if you were a clinton non of this would have ever been a blip on the screen i am ashamed that this country has continued this campaign of harassment
justice wins
i can not believe he can still become the president if he wins in our constitution that is crazy a president in jail or house jail to run our country we need that changed not felon of any office in usa should be allowed to run or serve our country from senatorcongresshouse of representatives and president and vice president geez

yep and hillary and biden walk free tells us why big corrupt government needs voted out btw hillary was found guilty by the fbi biden was found with illegal documents he stole as a senator lied about the hunter laptop with the whole government backing him meanwhile an invoice trump never filled out is his proof lol one invoice counted 34 times after the feds said no crime federal crime that cant be prosecuted by a state fjb stop the fentanyl train
so who will be the nominee now that donny is ineligible as a convicted felon much as i despise trump he was our best hope for gettting rid of senile joe hopefully theres somebody out there that can replace our current kook
vladimir biden is pleased by this outcome
we are officially a banana republicas you were salivating buttwip gave authority for ukraine to use our weapons to attack russia us military attacked the yemen capital nato announced there are 12 countries are prepared to attack russia welcome to the hell you built this will easily be overturned but you will still be stpid vote trumpearly and often
may you all be ready for your own legal issues to come up may we all get what we deserve and yes none of us are close to perfect
this is what the russians do to their political counterparts absolutely disgusting
and now well get to hear magas go crazy
2 tier justice system but thats okay he will still be the next president unless they assassinate him like they did epstien to hide their crimes seeing how schiff wants to pull his security detail if he goes to jail which tells me thats exactly what they plan to do they arent even hiding it so now when trump becomes president he can go after every political opponent because they did it and theres nothing you can do about it because if one can do it so can the other
lock him up
that will make more people vote for him
this is so unnamous its gonna be tough for even him to find something to pick atbut hell do what he does best and nake up bullshit trump fans seem addicted to shit dinner so theyll eat it uprest of the world
no one can save you from your own demise 6 years ago this man had everything and now he has nothing this is gods planet
a phony trial based on testimony of a liar and a prostitute the left is absolutely nuts
so if trump gets a 2nd term he could technically be impeached on day 1 these felonies were committed during his 1st twrm as president
welcome to america smh
jake you know the guy is guilty he tried using running for president to try and shield him from being prosecuted we seen it in plain sight gha lol
a low day for americans to bad for the left this will do nothing but help trump win 2024
orange jumpsuit to match his orange warpaint
what did you expect new york is chaulk full of ass holes including the judges and jurors
falsified business records imploding economy and war
a jury should take 2 or more weeks to go over all those counts they wanted to go home for sure
our country has fallen trump is a criminal so is biden these are the two candidates we get to choose to lead our country our country has fallen
what a joke verdict you just made him political prisoner atleast the jury deliberated a couple hours longer than the oj trial
donald trumps a felon
congratulations left wing americans now you can have biden for 4 more years stealing your tax money and giving it away to illegals ukrainian oligarchs and woke bs

clown court system
well those of you who hate trump should be very happy right now but you remember that theyll be a day and ill be after the elections and you will get up in the morning and you will realize that all of this was for nothing because donald trump will be your president
now we can continue to talk and hype up trump and his court drama until he is reelected fun times
this absolutely sickens me when will someone go after the treasonous criminals that are running this country now trump certainly isnt a perfect person but he who is without sin can cast the first stone bush clinton obama and especially the biden family will answer to a higher power than all their filth money they might think they have won but just watch this is just the beginning of their undoing
just got trump elected
make sure that you send your campaign contributions to the legit trump website trump2024
overturned upon appeal
if they can do it to trump they will do it to you democrat corrupt election interference
and still the best president of the united states of america trump 2024
cnnfakenews

ny uses fake law

horseshit
cnn has the wrong analysts such a disservice to their viewers all along they spun the testimonies without putting it into context cnn did not prepare their viewers for a possible guilty verdict when all the facts pointed to exactly that those of us who actually read lengthy daily court transcripts of this trial did more research than this inept media outlet ppl will unsubscribe there are yt networks that put in the time energy and have attys to dive deep and provide context of all of trumphs indictments and trials
wait a minutethen who are we going to vote for now cant vote for a felon damn it
congratulations to we the people

hes not guilty this is such a sham
what a joke this judge should be thrown out
when will the corrupt dems be tried hillary pelosiinsider trading sewell sleeping with a chinese spy govt secrets given away bob mendez fraud bribery pay offs biden bribery withheld to get a prosecutor fired to protect hunter joe 8 charges of sexual abuse this justice department is owned by this administration as the fbi ira etc what a farce sentencing a republican but all dems go free satan protects his own

does this mean that we as new yorkers can bring court cases based on this case doesnt have to commit a crime just think that a crime might have been committed and a proven lier can testify and lie and now that is factually testimony and now new yorkers in court are guilty until proven innocent wow this court case can change new york forever
communist news network disgusting whats happening
i wonder how much money was paid to all of the jurors for this
it was a fine verdict everyone is saying a perfect verdict the best theyve ever seen
what goes around i hope trump returns the favours when hes elected

this is policitians using the justice system to take out an opponent all these charges are bs im still voting for him this year
he still has my vote because all of you are idiots for believing this was in any way shape or form the fair and just trial he was guilty the day he stepped foot in that courtroom and every single one of you know it because like he said it was rigged from the beginning who thinks otherwise has clearly been brainwashed and should probably move to north korea where you fit in
this is absolutely sickening
now lock his ass up throw away the key and dont ever let him out again so much for his theory about a witch hunt
chad daybell and trump on the same day hallelujah even if only will actually get punished for real
convicting an innocent man do you dems realize this will make him a martyr

there is no condemnation for those who believe in christ i rejoice in the justice of god praying for my president 2428 he will prevail you will see even if corruption won for a while god bless our president trump i can wait to see him in the white house
this is obviously politically motivated you can hate trump and acknowledge that there isnt one comment thats visible pointing it out 90 bots comments being deleted seriously this is not a good thing he cant be beat fairly the justice system has to be weaponized like never before right before an election come on
if i could vote for him 10 times this november i would you guys just mythologized him forever

doesnt matter if he does no jail time at rikers
nolets go after bidenhunter nad hillary
all a sham by corrupt media and treasonous democrats that cant win the 2024 election on merit
will his name be removed from the november ballot if so i would recommend that condoleezza rice take over in the gop presidential ticket
our country is screwed
the fact this guy isnt in jail yet is absolutely mind boggling
and he will still win lmao
such a sham trial fisrt the judge is bought off second the could find any valid accusation so they just try to frame him third the jurors were carefully selected for their left biases the verdict as judge said does not have to be unanimous i wouldnt accept the juror in my local area usa is communist
the trial was a waste of time the jury had him convicted months ago stalins spirt is disgusted by how corrupt the courts in nyc are an assumption of guilt is not how its supposed to work
where is the epsteins list
hes going to appeal right and these charges will eventually become nothing and our justice system will remain a joke for people like him
about time ny has been taken advantage of since the 80s
his mugshot gained him so much more publicity i cant wait to see what this guilty verdict does for him trump 2024
me my family and lots of friends will be voting trump in november 2024 you cant keep a good man down
guilty of what the prosecutor and judge instructed them if they felt he did something but didnt charge him with anything this will be tossed out
its what weve known all along mental illness is a real thing
these judges are absolute criminals they are breaking the law dont forget they can do it to you too
now he will sky rocket in polls democrats are the most corrupted party on the face of the earth
the court was not rigged and you are the disgrace
corrupt judge daughter is a dnc operative told jury about nonexistent alleged crimes guided them to reach a guilty verdict judge didnt allow defense witnesses scolded defense witnesses told just they didnt need a unanimous decision which is absolutely unconstitutional 2630 mullins dollars for a campaign slogan if you think this is ok then you are as corrupt as the democrats
lets keep it going lets get the uniparty out or are we still chopping off baby dks
guilty bc hes guilty simple no man is above the law he should be treated like any other convicted felon lock him up voteblue this roevember
this is the person republicans wants to represent america a felon wake up america
a lot cnn fanatics here what biden guilty of smh america is done smh no more fair justice
what difference does it make not like there are going to put him in jail
so when they gonna start holding criminal politicians responsible and puting them in jail
its bullshitwowthe country is so asleep and on the verge of a real ass wippen my vote trump 2024
so is he still allowed to run for president good luck americans
cnns whole staff is commenting no organic comments on here sad
and the biden family is not guilty of anything
my heart is soaring
all of the judges and prosecutors and jurors in all of these indictments have been bought and paid for by crooked communistic joe biden and george soros
he just won the white house trump 2024
well at least youre calling him president now lololol gitmo for all you corrupt criminals
doesnt that mean that hes no longer allowed to run for president
on todays menujustice is served
its bullshit dosent change anything hell go on to a landslide election then paybacks a bitch
where is bidens guilty verdicts what about the cocaine in the whitehouse worst of all why is trumps sentencing coming in july usually sentencing takes a long time so why so fast because the election is coming fast thats why he is being railroaded by the liberal lying machine if we go through with this we should follow up on bidens charges
judge says we know the prosecution didnt prove he was guilty of anythingbut if you think he was guiltyits ok to find him guiltyfk democratsfk anyone who votes democratand fk cnn
trump just got new voters democrats and liberals love felons
still voting trump in 2024
i am so happy trump is now a convicted fellon americas go to your local booze store and party city cause this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
thankfully biden and his weaponized justice department still havent figured out the farther they weaponize their branches of government against the american people the more the american people want to vote them out of office this is already under appeal no time will be served until trump becomes the best president in history again the real trial will be november 5th and bidens failed policies are being tried
a least he was awake for this bit i hope he felt each charge
thank goodness
how can someone be guilty of using funds to conceal a crime when no crime was alleged let alone proven oh wait nyc
sham trialtrump 2024
im shocked a kangaroo court found him guilty
juries you guys have made the whole world proud good job guys
this will only make him pres trump stronger just watch god bless and to hell with the satanic new world order
they just made him even stronger
they lived counting these off one after another reminding everyone so often that is a felony effin crazy
anyone who believes this was a fair and just trial is a danger to our society
isnt going to stand and he will only get stronger and be our next president and anybody who supports politicizing the judicial system is fine has no clue of what this just opened up
dont drop the soap
hes been a felon for a very long time but now hes legally a felon
yet half the country still want this jackass as our president
cant wait until his polls go up even higher and make yo left wing clowns look even dumber you idiots just made him stronger
nobody is above the law
thats flat wrong
usa has turned into a third world banana republic in persecuting political enemies hillary obama biden can now be prosecuted for manipulating books and pushing russia gate just as how liberals prosecuted trump
he could have saved time by syaing he was found guilty on 3434 felony crimes
todayjustice in the home of democracy prevails
doesnt matter we expected this democrats are scared dont blame them but the trump train is rolling full steam ahead
lock him up
boomerangs incoming nothingcanstopwhatiscoming
not worried about it if dems try to keep him from the white house it will mean another civil war
clown world
venezuela cuba the former soviet union and now the united states the funny thing is that you demotards think this was a real trial this was the political persecution of the leading opposition party
i prayed for this for justice to happen to trump in this trial because it shows that right from the very beginning before the beginning he lied he cheated he broke the law in order to be elected we the american people were lied to by him we would not have voted for him to be our president if wed known the truth about him
oh yes lets celebrate
guilty with an asterisk
if you have the best attorney that money can buy and you still are found guilty by objective jurors that both the prosecution and defense agree upon i got one word for ya and that is guilty mr trump
this will be thrown out by the supreme court and the court will fast track the issue these were all misdemeanors watch
this country has gone to shit harris must have given joe a good one blew his mind can no longer function wow trump will still be elected book it
lol democrats are only helping trump
we will still vote trump ass wipes
now can we convict the current president for all the crimes he has committed and can we get him removed from office for not being able to pass a mental health assessment
a celebration for this scumbag finally getting his just desserts
whos surprised that a mob of democrats found him guilty on all counts nobody a new low for the democrats
gets overturned on appeal
finally justice is served
now america is great again with this verdict
everything trump has been accused of that has gone to trial hes been found guilty of or responsible for absolutely everything
based on this cnn is guilty as fack
how can a convicted man run for presisdent any man
he is still going to get reelected doesnt bar him from running and this will just expand his lead even further
seriously what a disgrace that this criminal can still run fr president
lmao democrats should run to the hills now that they have set this standard
the world is coming to an end the anti christ is against our great president donald trump
gee i guess all the corporate media were at a different trial judging by their coverage not jiving with the realities of events
we are at war
the final blow to any kind of hope that our entirely corrupted judicial system might yet survive
they just got him elected
the democrats shiuld be guilty for cheating the election
i wonder has anyone paid 8500000 to take out a full page ad in the new york times calling for his immediate incarceration
election interference by the marxist ny jury
when can we expect a list of the jurors names and addresses if one honest juror would have voted not guilty we would already have all of their information
donald trump is waking america up to how corrupt the mainstream media is hell win in a landslide after this sham of a trial
why the fuck did youtube delete my comment
still gonna win as it should
a day to celebrate
whats up nexterection
great clinton next cant wait we need equal justice
honest questions for my friends on the left if trump wins anyway what next 9 years numerous impeach efforts and now weaponizing the legal system what next if he wins
aaaand out come the trolls
the dallas mavericks and the minnesota timberwolves play game 5 tonight of the western conference finals with dallas leading the series 3 games to 1
this just sealed his ticket to the white house
its called karma
sham democrat election interference plain and simple
music to my ears
good thing its not russis where they actually kill their political opponents trump got it easy
its about time damm
im still voting for trump 2024 lol is there an echo in here ill never vote democrat again
he has the best felony charges
thats was fast and easy
justice
they just open a door dont cry about it when it bites you in the ass
time for him to fade into the background
da alvin bragg and his team undoubtedly but definitely have honestly perfectly fulfilled every single assignment on their job description
lock him up now
next to be found guilty hunter and hillaryoh wait they are dems never mind
woohoo there is still the rule of law
wheres the evidence there is none
now that donald trump has been found guity of alot of his crimes it will make his co conspirators think twice next time they try to break the law
well cnn you should be so happy thisthis should be a party time for all of you
cletus will be upset he couldnt count past 30
cant wait to vote for trump 2024
justice perverted
thank you stormy
just saying all that everyone is too afraid to say or too lotal to their dictator
all you did was get them elected today thank you so much i know 2025 is going to be much better
34 guilty
has the riots started yet
anybody with a brain in their head nose of jurors got paid off
thats 5 we still have 29 felony counts to go just a wild thing to say will still end in fines and no jail time i have no faith this dude will ever go to jail
the jury got paid off its simple math but they are not going to get our president he will be president again president trump
jurors are part of american history forever great job
trump just won the election trump 2024
hunter biden the son of president joe biden will go on trial for gunrelated charges on june 3
new york having authority over our next president is kinda like having foreign debts do you want a president that could be compromised by the state of new york probation and parole thats the next question american voters need to ask themselves no your supreme court justices cannot save him from the state of new york
convicted felon i wonder if that comes with a trophy or a bucket of kfc
i guess all convicted felons need to start running for president since this loser can do it he needs to be ban from running for the office of the presidency just imagine what else he has lied about
and this white makeup is still not in jail andis still able to rin for godt damm president
fox news doesnt have any choice but to continue lying to the world how pathetic may justice continue being served lock trump up
whats to stop him from fleeing as sentencing isnt until july 11th is it just house arrest or is dirty diaper don the convict in jail now
watching the legal system become weaponized to keep cheater joe in office again is quite comical this is the second work around they have used to keep shit pants joe around sheep
as a liberal voting for joe biden who cares about trumps verdict its meaningless he wont go to prison and he wont be barred from running for president in other words the verdict accomplishes nothing aside from some ability to gloat i guess there are only 3 requirements for presidential candidates written in the constitution and sadly being a convicted felon doesnt disqualify you he will exhaust the appeals process past the november election and probably has a better chance of winning now as his maga cult fanatics will come out in full support seeing it as the only means to save him from the political witch hunt they see it as once president hell be able to pardon himself or attempt to in which case itll go to the supreme court which of course is right wing majority who will say its constitutional as its not clearly defined nor strictly prohibited and hell yet again escape justice so literally why is anyone celebrating the verdict its meaningless
so he is fucked
he refuses to accept his guilt a prison sentence is the only appropriate punishment although its doubtful he would be reformed im sure he would be a repeat offender given the opportunity
he is officially a felon finally some accountability
as of today may 30 2024 donald trump has been found guily on all 34 counts hes a convicted felon great news thank you new york
on this day all business owners property owners and real estate owners in new york collectively decided to cease operations and relocate
thats it theres no way he can become the president of the united states now
the devil is dead the devil is dead trump be gone
all americans now can stand united and agree trump supporters biden supporters brain worm guy supporters what charges nobody said the charges is the worst defense in history charges all turned into convictions whether you knew them or not
couldnt have happened to a more deserving guy
yet he still walks free and will never see the inside of a prison cell any regular person would have the cuffs slapped on and be taken away
if youre a liberal best to run for canada
guilty in the first degree on all charges trump was rightly not to testify
lock him up
what a wonderful time to be alive
twelve good citizens and trueas a convicted felon can he vote
yessssssss popping the champagne cork
karen looks nervous because she knows how bad this conviction is for the justice system that the public making comments does not
the big question now is whether the media will help dt undermine us courts
no one is shocked i guess maybe him since his only excuse was everyone commits fraud and falsifies records and misuses donated money no no they dont trump because thats illegal
guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty one small step for democracy one giant leap for patriotic americans who love and respect the rule of law inherent in the us constitution the six pillars of character trustworthiness respect responsibility fairness caring and citizenship oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive sir walter scott 1808
now sentencing does the judge whos family has been put at risk allow a man who deliberately places live at risk walk on probation i say 14th of his time served 34 on parole of a 4 year concurrent sentencing on the grounds he withdraws from holding office in any state and he pay restitution for all the security involved in keeping the people safe
justice matters thank you jury
they are no longer charges they are now 34 convictions
mother teresa couldnt even beat these charges
the jury made america great again
ok lets get that next eg carrol defamation suit against this felon
trump wont be sentenced until jan 2025 thats bs it still allows time for the presidential election to be stolen through racial gerrymandering and voter suppression if this pervert wins he can pardon himself every branch of government provides a failsafe for white supremacy the will of the people gets redirected back to a privileged few
judged by a jury of his peers putin was on the jury
it was a perfect verdict
i couldnt vote but he can run for president
undoubtedly but definitely all credits to da alvin bragg and his team they demonstrated extremely hard work thorough investigation attention to minute details no matter how small and above all solid determination and absolute courage to put justice where it belongs stepping over all threats
ding dong donnie america is great again because of the jurors and hopefully youll lose the appeal this year hasnt gone your way at all donnie oh well happens
yeah this probably means nothing hell be president again and crown himself king
trump i have the most felony convictions of any president ever
sex in the shower hey don pick up the soap
if agnew had to step down because he was found guilty of tax fraud then theres no way someone convicted of 34 counts of document fraud should even be allowed to run
donald trump knew he was guiltyhe knew he had done this
had to download this video its historic love the 34 guilties its like a symphony
theres going to be a shit load of ketchup to clean up and dozens of toilets to unclog
to pardon a wealthy criminal who has committed crimes constantly lies acts selfishly would be a crime
george mute your mic before you rummage in your bag
dont celebrate this cnn because november will be coming soon and we in america are going to elect donald trump as our next president no matter what you call him
its now time the irs started an extensive investigation into the entire trump crime family as i think they have been up to no good for some time34 felony counts of falsifying business records etc and guilty on all of these counts is a good enough reason
1 year of probation for every felony 34 years of probation is fair
trump has spent his whole life like this and it took him trying to apply the same corrupt principles in politics to finally see some accountability but you know the maga cult will just continue to believe it is anything and everything except trumps own fault
so whats the penalty of his 34 guilty felonies
right verdict has prevailed congratulations from stockholm
i said id do a shot of whiskey for each guilty verdict currently en route to er
today should be declared as national holiday may 30th 2024
in this case i would vote for trump too
gop needs an honest candidate nikki
jake tapper enjoyed that
congratulations america you had us worried
a great day for the country
in the mean time we are broadcasting our 1st 2024 presidential debate from rikers island tonight

no man is above the law and no man is below it nor do we ask any mans permission when we ask him to obey it theodore roosevelt
lock him up if the crimes were severe enough for michael cohen to go to jail then the crimes are certainly serious enough for donald trump the criminal former president the person at whose direction and for whose benefit the crimes were committed to plop his ample orange backside in jail too the downfall will be broadcast worldwide and it will be broadcast in hd he wanted to be famous he wanted attention now hes got it historical famous and i confess that the petty in me is lurrrrrrrvsing the felony verdict counter
four years per charge four more years four more years
donald shitzinpants trump is now an old broken down jailbird
lock his as up
too bad his wall has not been build
from london england well done america just keeping the world safe every single day best news all year
chump is now a flight risk but who would want him in their country other than putin of course
now they must prosecute the republican party and republican members of congress as part of the rico conspiracy
guilty fair and square for the first time we can confirm he is the disgraced former president of the united states
and you in america will allow this man to run for president why
i sincerely hope this means he doesnt get to vote for himself this year
cnn and the dematurd party has been trying to destroy trump ever sense he put hillary in her place
hell never spend a day in jailbut its still a good day guilty
hillary somewhere laughing out loud as she should she screaming out loud lock him uplock him up
thank god the american justice system works and these rich people are not getting away with the crap they do
trump the adjudicated rapist is now a convicted felon
is anyone else simply mindblown at the fact that somebody can be charged with a felony and still try to run for president
get in
and yet they still didnt cuff him and take him off to a holding cell i guess that only happens on tv when sam waterstons the ada
i just want to know if he was handcuffed after the guilty verdictif not that is not justice anybody else wouldve been handcuffed
bless the jury lets pray the judge will punish him like anyone else the fact that he was a former president should mean mandatory jail time
a convicted felon is running for president he can never vote in the us but he can run for president freedom or whatever jake tapper deserves to break this news hes been so blatantly over trump for years lol
does anyone think this is going to change how maga is going to vote
from heaven youre done rest in peace america
since he can still run as a convict in the elections does this mean other convicts can vote in the elections
excellent news 34 charges all found this 45 gop fascist guilty citizen trump is now a convicted felon
yum yum eating my celebratory felony brownies right now mmmmm tastes like justice
best day in america since 2016 it just feels like finally justice he has never been held accountable for anything in his life until today
cue the russian troll network

jimmy kimmel might organize a parade

americas fucked
trumps gonna be selling maga34 merch because hes just that cheap this man is a disgrace to america and american democracy is coming to an end because of him and his sycophants

thank you stormy daniels for telling the truth and facing down the maga mob thank you cohen for the same thank you to everyone who tried to do the right thing in this case and endured having their lives endangered by the orange turd i never thought itd be anything but a hung jury so thank you jurors for being brave enough to do your jobs convicted felon 34 times over yet the republicanmaga red hat nazi regime is still going to do everything they can to win this election vote vote vote its time for we the people to save our democracy the world is watching
and all your right wing sucks had reasons why he would be acquitted again i say why do you give them airtime lol
i dont understand how it is possible that blacks latinos and minorities residing in the united states can vote for this being who has denigrated humiliated cosified and offended us so much this is degrading incredible to believe in him and to vote for him is not to respect oneself
better get the passport hes got a butt load of classified docs to sell
ok color me a negative nancy having never expected that on day 1 of deliberation the jury said eh waitstophes fing guilty back to front youre welcome i figured the deliberation would go at least a week that the verdict was reached immediately is both stunning and completely obvious at the same time
this is why i love america because nobody is above the law the constitution is the law of the land
hooray for our country
they know a crook when they see one
the usa has now officially become a banana republic
fuck ya first felon president baby we going places
really they convicted and charged him cause they dont want him to be president this opens a pandoras box so be happy now i dont care either way he nor joe biden havent done anything to make my life better
all those black people will adore him if they loved mugshot trump they surely will love don the con at least that is the racist thinking of his campaign desperate denialism
trump just got elected president
its official democrats have turned new york into germany during world war ii or the ussr under stalin take your pic either applies with how democrats use the legal system
youve got to laugh
so how many crimes can you commit and still vote
i currently live in mexico and have been critical of the us but today i was a proud american
normally i wouldnt enjoy watching a guy count but this was fabulous
maybe now they can get him off state ballots since he is a convicted felon
cnn found guilty of falsifying news from day one
congratulations usa when will the civil individual voters class action suit for stolen votes begin
its a good day for the us justice system
how can he run for president when he cant even vote
what happens now to donald trump
the best is yet to come the insurrection trial is eagerly waiting
i disagree w one of the correspondents saying that jury members should talk to the media to let them know what convinced them but i disagree we know from jan 6 that many of t___ps cult are violent insane going public would put their safety in danger so i hope the media respects the jurys privacy
congrats murica a dim sparkle of hope
you all know this will be overturned on appeal right
congratulations from canada
trump 2024 american is lost and we need a strong leader democrats are the party of the weak and woke no thanks you guys go ahead and vote for biden maybe hell still be alive in november trump will win anyway
nigeria is waiting for such a day corruption everywhere
election interference
the ultimate loser
based upon the questions the jury asked of the judge it was pretty clear they had decided trump guilty of all 34 counts yesterday and spent today dotting is and crossing ts before returning to the court room and condemning trump to becoming a 3 strike lifer in new yorks rykers island
trumps reaction to the verdict was as to be expected he sees himself as innocent and hes the victim of a witch hunt spoken as a true narcissist he simply is not able to see that he is only human who can make wrong decisions in life i feel bad for his wife and children who are loyal to him but deep inside must feel and know hes not innocent at all
and yet hes still in the running for president we need a new amendment to stop someone like him ever running again felons should not be allowed to run for any office in my opinion
such drama they are the same charge whos moderating the debate
say it isnt so jake oh the humanity
trumps a criminal even the alternates would have voted to convict
were happy right now so lets just ride this feeling jungkookbts
the jury did a good job did it not hold back this is now a history moment for america and for the other countries to realize that the united states is not going to miss around bro
what a nice day in the united states of america
where is lee greenwood now god bleeesssssss the uuuuuuu ssssss aaaaaaaaaaaa
we want trump for president 2024
justice are you serious wow america we should make it a holiday and have a parade we can bbq
perp walk him to the presidency
congrats to all the sane americans
trump just gained millions of supporters way to go
he cant keep his penis in his pants and he cant stop self snitching
perhaps there is a bit of justice in the american legal system after all just need to put traitor trump in prison now
but they could still elect a felon presidentand the ramifications of that for the rest of the g7
when you dont testify in your own trial to clear your name youre definitely guilty no more argument
now watch him get probation
what difference does all this make he can vote and he can still run for presidency
a jury of his peers should have been a panel of previous presidents only or am i too dumb
it couldnt happen to a nicer not a best news in a very long time
is it just me or is everyone here getting a huge boner
he wasnt sleep then huh in my akon voice convict
american forefathers gives a standing ovation on american legal system god bless
its a great day for america when a filthy crook like trump is held accountable and found guilty hey trump the teflon has rubbed off and youre guilty
wooooolock him up criminal trump is the truthamerica great again
democracy saved
god came thruwe are celebrating in colorado
thank you from mexico theres never been a wall
justice has been served i still believe in this great american justice lock him up
truth always prevails all his lies are to catch up with him one day or the other why does not this christian man not realise this continues to mock helpless people lie call people names no hope anywhere
finally guilty justice is served
from the uk thank christ for that just hope he ends up in jail what is worrying is what will all the maga lunatics do now hope all those whove been threatened are being protected
let me see each paystub they claiming make him guilty
america is getting close to becoming great again
woohooo the wheels of justice turn slowly but they are turning
welcome to the corrupt police state
ha ha nelson muntz
american justice prevailed
how long will it take to see him start to cry in his car now what is going on do he can still run for president so lets just wait and see like his other cases
guilty on all accounts l o c k h i m up c o n v i c t e d c r i m i n a l
no maga on the jury or even the maga juror said i give up
i guess republicans need to start doing the same thing watch out biden hillary etccriminal charges are coming
simply put his chickens have just come home to roost 12 of his peers have spoken after careful deliberations
lock him up
how does jake tapper keep himself from smiling while reading these verdicts im grinning ear to ear listening
can everyone with more than 5 felony charges who havent had to go to jail right away pls stand up no one huh
convicted felon trump for prison 2024
c for cantd for denying the ttruth
trumps a criminal anyone who can count knows this
let me see the falsified records
these jurors had more guts than our current surpreme court
what him and vince mcmahon have in common
being a man who famously claimed he could be more presidential than anybody i expect mr trump to graciously announce that he accepts the jurys verdict and will be resigning from political life in order to spend his future in sober contemplation of his unfortunate actions i also expect him to ask the forgiveness of the american people
trump will continue to lie to his supporter that biden single handily found him guilty instead of the jury of his peers
now i a democrat will give trump my vote this is a sham and a corrupt government looking to penalize political rivals not even in a third world nation
maybe he should have paid her
thank you to everyone on the jury returning our faith in the justice system of course trump wont go to jail and he will appeal appeal appeal all the way to the supreme court he will now do everything to waste more taxpayers money on who knows how many lawsuits this person needs to go away forever
if he only one would have taken 15mins 34 counts 10 hours must have been the printer
defendant lawyers judge jury guilty
yes yes yes yes yes lock him up now
this calls for something special think i need to learn yodeling
put your american flags out today
the us has just removed dt from the presidential race big mistake the world is doomed because he is the only one who could avert the looming wwiii
i thought trump was going to testify and prove his innocence its all the democrats fault lol lock em up
lets see whether the scotus overrules the conviction many think it will
he may get to join the patriots hostage choir in prisonnot only by audio in his rallies
i cant not watch this in a loop for an hour
thank god
next upgeorgia
finaly no one is above the law jail him up
watch the criminal back off the debates now always a loser
all 34 countsi was thinking maybe 2
here comes the appeal
ohhh guilty central park five have been vindicated krama was waiting for you trumptake a holiday long vacation and rethink your life with truth and justice the american new york city wayyy
i aint seen a 34 this big since shaq played for the lakers
send him to prison
so he will end up in prison finaly
yay lock his ass up now
so like al capone he was found guilty for tax evasion even if he did terrible acts same here djt guilty for falsifying records even if he did worst things
now congress needs to change law on who can hold office add felony to the list so no one like trump can serve the highest office in the land its ridiculous that one can hold office if one heshe has a felony
he wont do a day and he can still run and be president he just cant vote lmao
i am surprised this is even a news who didnt see this coming its ny democrats headquarter by the way i doubt this will move a needle in the polls watch
who will want to run for president in the future knowing its now fair game for an incumbent to mobilize the doj and fbi to prosecute a political opponent to avoid a fair election our country has been destroyed in 3 and 12 years by a corrupt and incompetent president we are a the banana republic get ready for higher taxes runaway inflation and energy dependence
get you some of that orange shitler
republicans better watch out for revengenot looking good at all
all those republicans claiming this was a rigged trial or kangaroo court or political prosecution shame on you all trump was convicted by regular folks based on the testimony of trumps republican friends allies youve made every excuse in the world for trumps disgusting despicable conduct
hello convicted felon
america has hope again one hundred we are back
yep hes got my vote for sure and i consider you all as co conspirators you truly are traitors to your country now if ever it was in question its not any more you are the enemy from within dont act surprised when they come for you we will not relent until you are held accountable for your lies and fraud youve committed on the american people
lock him up lock the criminal as he is
he should be locked up
he finally got the popular vote
alright jake count each 1 explain them then explain how he gets out again the gop and the media dont want this to ever stop
great news doubt hell be punished though
this is a good day for america a very good day for all americans
any one of us would get 4 years prison tadump will get a slap on the wrist cuz hes learned his lesson
american billionaires supporting him are like him and they all must be held accountable
if he doesnt do time dont try stopping anyone for anything crime obviously pays
seems they arent celebrating over at fox
a convicted felon cant vote right can a convicted felon run for president
now lets get him in the other cases
america has always been great without this guy will be better
its crazy that exfuture presidents get special consideration one would think holding the highest position in the land youd be held to a higher standard surely the resume to be hired at that level should include not being a criminal
great now lets get him convicted in atlanta washington dc and miami next yes i know those cases are delayed for various bad reasons but those cases should still proceed
convicted felon now theres no doubt hes the worst president in the history united states mob boss finally found guilty
trump need money on his books maga help
the 13000000 payment was for tricking people in power keep side chicks this is not fair great criminal defense leading up to the conviction money can get you all the appeals you need
lady liberty and lady justice are smiling today
great day for america with many more to come he should go to prison but wont
how can he still run for president please haley take his place
guilty clown
being a first time offender experts say hes unlikely to go to jail chumpy is till going to run for president vote like you never have in nov
hes been found guilty repeat 34 times lol
magacnn will not tell you but i will the majority of jurors were republicans and they voted to convict on all counts
when the teflon wears off its time to throw the pan away
american billionaires supporting are like him
i love the word guilty so much now and this video clip for reading it out 34 times
from canada your country sucks im ashamed for having to share a border with a communist country
democrats just guaranteed trump to win for president
felonious don
so hes the biggest fraudster in the american history so when is he starting his jail term
lets wait for polls to go up cnn gloating
better watch out the poor baby will stop eating again the house speaker will have to come cheer him up
about time
had any one been convicted of this many felonies ever
slap the cuffs on him
just came from fox coverage reading comments lol whine city
he cant even vote for himself now my faith in the justice system had a little restoration today
i wonder what the sentence will be
how sad are maga karen moscow tools for believing everything defendant trump says without him showing any evidence
wonder what fox news is saying
he fought the law and the law won
he should now have to surrender his passport and be put under house arrest in mara logo until sentencing i dont trust this pig to not get on his jet and try to run prior to sentencing he will do whatever he needs to we all know this now he will cry like a little baby how he can go to prison for all of use
the world is watching how americans will vote for felon candidature
as we know he is going to appeal i was sure they would have a hung jury or mistrial but im pleasantly surprised
yay hahahahahayay the thiefrapist has finally gotten what has been so long coming you know the tradesmen he ripped off with the taj mahal are so happy right now aaaahahahahayay
and yet his fellow republicans will still vote for him haley embarrassing
a great day for america
he finally got the popular vote
nikki haley probably slams her head against the wall multiple times realizing she has announced to vote for trump in november
its amazing to understand hows in someone healthy mind that 12 people are wrong about those crimes committed
donald trump is no longer going to be campaigning for the 2024 election he will now begin his retribution tour and riling up his supporters please be safe everyone
the fact that he can still run for president though reveals the broken system in the us a convicted felon cant vote but he sure can run for president what a joke
there went joes chances his only hope was running against trump if hes out of the picture so are joes hopes for reelection
he was potus while commiting felonies
omg i cant believe someone finally held him accountable
this is good day for the world now lets read comments
lock him up
youtube took away the like button so we cant see the insane difference in likes vs dislikes trump will win fools
those are the votes he was looking for
all of the magaturds will be flying their flags upside down for the next 10 years
cuff him
a great day for america god bless america and the american judicial system justice served
now hes found guilty of all charges will he be allowed to run president it will be crazy if he still can run
also on a side note n korea launching excrement balloons to s koreathat was donalds idea

here is what none of you realize the prophecies of revelation are unfolding right before our eyes and most dont see it i dont take a side here because i know that both sides will soon lose did you know that revelation speaks of a day when atheists will back religionists into a corner and those religionists will not take it sitting down mainstream protestants and catholics are fallen churches they dont hold true bible doctrine they have placed themselves on satans ground and hes playing them like a fiddle they are going to legislate a religious law soon sunday observance will be mandatory by all this religious law enacted by the right is the mark of the beast they too are pawns of satan satan is playing both sides off each other to accomplish his goal you might be smiling right now but its not going to last you had better get right with god in a genuine way public satanic miracles will begin to occur soon and the entire world with the exception of the remnant will be swept up there will no longer be any atheists the entire world will be converted over night but to what a false world religion do not go along with the sunday laws they are coming trust me i know things
ready to vote trump 2024 from florida
in the words of trump perfect it was a perfect verdict believe me perfect
the man who broke america guilty
newsflash trump never accepts responsibility for anything
a just verdict and let us hope for just sentencing but its obvious trump is never going to accept any of this and will tell his lies as he did for the last presidential election i do not look forward to the way the more militantly insane of his maga supporters are going to respond in the month before sentencing i think this really good news is going to result in something really bad happening if his followers are capable of insurrection what else might they prove to be capable of
reading each charge of the same exact crime the pettiness
keep it coming more trump trials more guilty verdicts trump in prison asap
the law and order president
lets not forget the rest of what he was charged with interference w the 2016 election
a major victory for america and for democracy

thats all i have stated previously do you feel the score of the morning if necessary the us supreme court will overturn the convictions so democrats dont break out the champagne yet
this has to be the nail in the coffin to solidify worst president in us history 34 felony convictions and 2x impeached how can anyone say otherwise
yass finally
he finally won the popular vote today
felonious trump sings the blues
get out of the cult they call maga before you support a convicted felon
just knowing he had to sit there and listen to the guilty verdicts being read 34 times brings a smile to my face
lock him up this ah belongs to jail
yes god is in his house
i had to speed this up to 15x so many guilties
the best is yet to come
if you think hitler was bad well trump is worse america wake up
guilty guilty guilty and guilty guilty x 34 guilty 34 times criminal lock him up now
im sick of winning
guilty af
trump will run to his friends in the supreme court to reverse this lets see if they still want to protect him afther 34 guilty verdicts and cannon you are now officially protecting a guilty criminal that is only waiting on his sentence in manhattan time to choose sides
cnn you are full of shit
at this time lets not forget the 15 million american citizens who died from covid19 in part based around the terrible mismanagement of donald trump president and the tens of thousands of ukrainian military personnel that ive had to die based around the appalling mismanagement of the republican party clearly at the hands of donald trump slava ukraine trump will need to change his diapers now but so will putin
now imagine losing the presidency to a convicted criminal but thats exactly what the polls show and not surprising at all when our current prez has not only enabled a genocide but continues to shit on those protesting it
please lock him up
he found guilty letting him know that no one is above the law plus he had it coming lets be real he got away w having people to invade the white house hurting people etc but while some of them did time or had to cough up fines also donald didnt do any time or fine at all while he was caught on footage and thru text inviting them there plus he was a sore loser leaving the white house he didnt wanna be a sport and take his defeat so people wanna still put him in and go thru the drama again really u aske me he or biden is not the best for running i truely believe a younger person a fresh face brighter ideas and someone different that have not gotten a chance to do so trump found guilty sinple as that because he is guilty so no excuses or once again trying to put it on someonelse or some other thing etc cant blame on no one else but his selfnow he tried to down play like he was so innocent and to fool people who were supporters of his but he basically played w there minds and he knew he was lying time for some of even his supporters to think about that and realize
so trump cant vote but he can still run for president what the f is wrong with our country
cohen is vindicated now justice prevailed still believe in american justice
i want to super like surly the teflon is wearing off this better bring out the non voters to beat him off being anywhere near to the white house grab him by the p and drag him to jail
lock him up lock the traitor and throw away the key he deserves life in prison
i guess they didnt listen to cnn analyst saying he should be acquitted
fuckin corrupt
i was trying to decide if i would vote for rfk jr or trump after this verdict i will be voting for trump 100
he will get zero jail time we all know it
the felon donald trump no longer deserves president in his title
whos still going to pucker up to be his vp now
judge canon you will lose your job when blue taking the house
and let the appeals begin
biden or his staff should not comment on this appalling individual let the justice system complete its course
maga accepts these charges gracefully we will appeal
queue the kool and the gang its a celebration
welcome to the united states of banana republic this jury and cnn should be ashamed of themselves its horrifying what happening to our country well never get back to normal after this
the system works
it took a long time usa but at last some justice well done from australia
locked up they wont let me out
trump is now a convicted felon does that mean he cant vote in florida not even for himself
it is good news donald trump is now a felon and he should never be elected president again
so there is a god after all justice is served
justice served from the golden escalator till today
a great day for our democracy guilty and jailed to the orange traitor
yes im loving this
just stopping by to remind everyone that donald trump as we all knew he was anyway is now a convicted felony now when he rails on his rally stages about countries emptying their jails and not sending their best it will be about a population he has alot in common with note those felons and mexican rapists never existed he lied about that too loser
im still not holding my breath hes a master weasel he seems to avoid accountability all the time
he should have sung the verdict
inew york
lock him up
those are expired misdemeanors though
34 for 45 love it
thank you newyork
you got anymore of those redneck tears
no matter how much he whines about this and he will at this moment he is angry and humiliated i could not be happier wellwhen he is behind bars or gone from the earth butall in good time
this is justice
everything that is done in the dark shall come into light orange turd
the gop in congress could have made his life better by upholding his impeachment at least that would have made these convictions less important or possibly negotiable
so many counts on donald trump so death sentence or get deported to russia
thanks be to god the anti christ trump received a consequence for his behavior
perfect and thank you to all jurors for their fair and honest verdict justice is served for this one
this had to happen democrats cant afford to have president trump run for president and completely unravel the fraud from the 2020 lockdown election
his business was convicted for fraud his university and foundation also hes a fraud
our country died today
america at its finest we the people fond you guilty
mitsumeeshi and userunionwrestlin you posted excatly the same thing on the cnn video bots alive and well on youtube ofcourse democrats are making your food cost more keeping you from buying a home and will probably get you into a nuclear war enjoy frothing at the mouth over this one you wont have money soon and hunger will become your only concern
great day for usa but also for the humanity
congratulations idiots you have just insured trumps election way to go
looks like he finally won the popular vote
cnn this is a history day for america msnbc this is the greatest day ever fox news the woke want us all dead
its sad that the democrats just ensured trumps victory in november they should be ashamed of themselves
take that putin no more puppets in the usa well except for the republicants
the sun over the us is shining just a bit brighter since trump took office and brought darkness upon our country cant wait until the darkness is lifted once hes locked up
the jury had just given trump the keys to the white house in november if i was in america i would vote for him how cruel you people are im proud to be irish but this in my opinion and many irish people here is a set up biden is no irishman the cruelty of all this im shocked at what america does to a former president
its my 35th birthday
donnie you got a perfect 34 out of 34 today arent you proud you got 100 of the vote
cnn needs to talk about this being about him using election money to do this
my faith in the justice system has been restored
sounds like news from vietnam or malawi
im smiling from ear to ear happy as a pig in shit
i hope everyone remembers this was the weakest case i truly believe that he will be in the hospital for heart issues hes finally realized that he may not be above the law and even without his medical issues is shitting his pants his insomnia and obvious cognitive decline are killing him
not too many magats commenting i guess they cant type with tears in their eyes
is it time to lock him up
can we now stop calling him president trump or former president trump and can we start calling him disgraced former president trump
if he doesnt get jail time for 34 felony convictions i dont ever want here shit from republicans about people being entitled ever again
fun fact being a convict makes one unable to vote but still able to run for the presidency of the us
be aware of the supreme court
i was worried todays appentice newx might mess with the verdict but no worries about that now i guess the jury wouldnt have had a chance to hear about it
from president to a convicted felon
the judges in the appeals court are going to fight over who gets to sit on the easiest case they ever had to overturn our democracy is over in new york
i think hes guilty
now will the republicans if someone other than donald trump wins the presidential election pardon trump
i agree with donald for the very 1st time yes a disgrace
looks like all those cnn panelists who questioned the strength of this case were completely wrong suggestion dont have them as panelists going forward because their opinions are worthless
sentencing phase do as the romans did
look at all the kommie kucks cream in their jeans i predict most of you wont do well in the next year you reap what you sow
arc of history is long but it bends towards justice
orange is the new black
trump no matter what
thank you jesus praise the lord
this just shows everyone hes really one of the people not a politician you just voted him in for suretrump 2024
ny just elected trump as next president thats what it means
so a convict is running for president for the first time
trump is innocent and the people know it and when they vote in 2024 cnn will see it trump 2024
thats some banana republic shit
can i convicted felon run in a presidential election
maga 34 made guilty again and again 34 times tired of winning yet djt
damn it i was hoping he would be the official not presumptive nominee before the verdict came out darn it that the justice system doesnt follow political timelines
mark these words the truth about this judge and the jury pool in this case will soon be out
na na na na na na na na hey heyey goodbye hell never love you the way that i love you cause if he did no no he wouldnt make you cry he might be thrillin baby but amy love my love my love so doggone willin so kiss him i wanna see you kiss him wanna see you kiss him go on and kiss him goodbye now na na na na hey heyey goodbye na na na na na na na na hey heyey goodbye listen to me now hes never near you to comfort and cheer you when all those sad tears are fallin baby from your eyes he might be thrillin baby but amy love my love my love so doggone willin so kiss him i wanna see you kiss him i wanna see you kiss him go on and kiss him goodbye nana nanana na na na na na na hey heyey goodbye hey heyey goodbye na na na na na na na na hey heyey goodbye na na na na na na na na hey heyey goodbye na na na na na na na na hey heyey goodbye

i hope trump gets hannibal lecter as a cell mate and not mother teresa
guilty as the lord command and the people of new york take responsibility
they still wont understand what he is guilty of trumps supporters are the poorly educated all they will do is make excuses for him over and over and over
donald goes to jail and not hillary you just cant make this stuff up lock him up
touche
those people who kept asking what the crime was finally got their answer
im sure he thinks hes truly the best out of all convicted felons ever convicted felon donald trump has a nice ring to it
let justice reign supreme let the maga tears flow
and all 34 counts are well deserved donald j trump the number 1 convict take a bow you joker
will trump be getting a new orange suit to go with his orange face
cheers to michael cohen you and stormy showed great courage enjoy your champagne tonight
protect the jurors judge and pa at all costs their lives are at stake
no surprise with national socialist democrats new york state national socialism nyc national socialism prosecutor national socialist judge national socialist jury pool national socialist
dumbfounded i was expecting at least one juror to be coopted pleasantly surprised how many years of appeals sorry about my skepticism coming out
why do i get visions of rats polticians jumping off the trump ship
finally justice served they didnt buy one bit of his lie
trump said today this is rigged but he did not say the same when his accomplice cohen was sentenced to 3 years
i have a lot of beloved videos jfk mlk the moon landing etc but this one is definitely in my top 5
making america great again
trump in 2020 person woman man camera tv trump in 2024 courtroom prosecutor judge jury verdict trump in 2025 guard cellmate bars toilet cot
yes mr tapper an unbelievable moment in american history and a very sad day in american history according to all of the allegations and the facts it is still not clear as to what the underlying crime was it feels like american has sunk to the depths of a thirdworld country
when he goes on appeal trump should ask the appeal court to delay the appeal until after the elections
he has been grabbed by the puy
this is really a great beautiful mantra
trump voice im the greatest felon of all time trust me everyone agrees with me by far the best ever
he must be given real prison time like anyone else on earth judge must give him yrs in prison no probation
great isnt it now we just need to here prison time in years not months
congratulations from new zealand thrilled for you all now put that mongrel in prison forever
finally that broken old man has gotten away with murder for way too long
and yetdumpy can still run for president what a joke
hey trumpfleeplan to escape maybesiberiano
the biggest loser today is americawhat have we become
convicted felon can run for president but also convicted felons cant vote here this country is a fucking joke
laugh it up now democrats you wont be laughing in november this jury just handed trump the election on a silver platter
i believe in our justice system lock him up america is always been great good job by the jury
bring on the maga tears
we knew that this sham trial was rigged from the beginning its gonna backfire i know that the mainstream liberal media and democrats and liberals are celebrating and probably gonna party they got what they planned the thing is that people who are not blinded by tds wil see this for what it is its just a way to stop trump and to smear him now cnn and msnbc can call him a criminal felon celebrate while you can its not gonna do what you expected
creepy joe molested his daughter ashley in the shower when she was 7 per his daughter ashley fact

maybe cnn will stop caring about every horrible thing trump says now that hes a felon
the donald is a winner he got 34 out of a possible 34 he got them all a score
laugh while you can hes still going to win in appeal court and be our next president and hell follows for democrats
thats a hot mess of guiltys
new york has learned from north korea
this is as bad as cnns ratings trump2024
congratulations from australia
joe biden will now be indicted the minute he leaves office by a republican da who will take this page from the democrats playbook the powerhungry democrats put their party above the country and opened pandoras box by prosecuting and jailing a political opponent bec he threatens their power this case was manufactured by a local da who campaigned on getting trump but has no authority to prosecute a federal elections case and a corrupt democrat judge in a democrat city with a democrat jury let this charade go to trial
crooky crook
eat it trumpstains
trump supporters dont care what hes going to do for them theyre more interested in what he promises to do to others
excellent his poll numbers and donations will rise this virtually guarantees donald trump will be our next president
lock the mf up now
just remember this people you vote for trump you are voting for a criminal convicted felon you are going to vote for a felon just remember this trump is a felon
finally
guilty of election interference the hush money was evidence of the crime not the crime
yeap from now on our politicians will attempt to arrest the other side just like in the very countrys we used to look down on you people arent smart enough to understand why that is a problem

tapper in the battle of his life to keep from racing around the room screaming respect the professionalism also respect the pride passion and patriotism of everyone who has been racing around screaming for the last 30 minutes we need diversity
cnn still cant get it right it isnt a hush money scheme it was an election inteference and fraud case
woot 34 counts of guilt and many more to go bwhahahaha

not at all a surprise if you followed the actual case and not fox and truth social
means nothing hes going to appeal imagine if he becomes president he will pardon himself
i love it hes trying not to laugh lock trump up
powerful men are falling like leaves in america not above the law now biden turn for manipulating the votes with the unregulated immigrants
wahoo thank you there is a god
its not like we could not see this coming no matter what donald trump is going to be the republican nominee for president
years ago i resolved never to vote for a democrat candidate that resolve is now admantine
fake garbage psyop enforced by the globslists running cnn nbc cbs and other news networks
its a great day in america i guess the system does work
as a democrat i will now vote trump after seeing this stalinist type of court system
have i misunderstood i believe that in america a felon may not vote how then can it be that such a person could come within an idle daydream of the presidency with public acceptance
glory days trump goes to jail
that s a great day for america democracy is still alive big up from france to all my american fellow
guilty on all 34 charges love it
save this video and use it as white noise to fall sleep with

congratulations you accomplished nothing except making trump more popular neither this trial nor any upcoming trial has one day of mandatory jail time and he can still run for president what was this all for yout feelings and you all fell for it
what a great day for america now to lock him up
convicted sexual predatorrapist and now guilty of corruption as well although he has a long history of fraud and hush money settlements so nobone should be surprised he needs to be locked up
trump mounted no defense other than nuhuh
for bragg the district attorney who inherited the trump investigation and charged the case in the face of vocal doubts including from fellow democrats about the viability of the prosecution the verdict is likely a significant relief and a vindication of his efforts
put him prison no criminal should be able to run for president of america he is a felony
congratulations from canada
i will be watching fox for days love seeing janine spewing and that goldfishiq waters drowning in his own idiocy
salty maga tears are delicious
lady justice is crying under that blindfold a blindfold that was ripped from her face
donald trump was found guilty thursday of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star making him the first former president to become a convicted felon the unanimous verdict from the 12person jury ends a sixweek trial in which prosecutors accused trump of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election as the jury foreperson read the verdict trump looked toward the jury box after the foreperson finished reading the verdict the former president looked straight ahead appearing somewhat red in the face then as the jurors individually confirmed that they agreed with the verdict trump stared at them it now falls to the judge justice juan merchan to determine trumps sentence he scheduled the sentencing for july 11 four days before the republican national convention begins falsifying business records carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison but because the crime is nonviolent and trump has no prior convictions any prison time is far from guaranteed merchan could opt instead for home confinement probation or a milder form of supervised release trump is certain to appeal the verdict a process that could take many months or even years meanwhile he stands accused of additional wideranging criminal conduct in three other cases two for subverting the 2020 election results and one for hoarding classified documents after he left office but none of those cases appears likely to go to trial before election day despite its historic nature there is scant evidence that trumps conviction in the hush money case will drastically alter his prospects in the 2024 race he has a small lead over president joe biden in many swingstate polls a lead that held steady throughout the trial one reason for the likely lack of fallout is that the payoff at the center of the case and the events surrounding it have long been publicly known the wall street journal first revealed them in 2018 and since the trial was not televised the details of the legal proceedings have remained opaque to many voters recent polls have shown that most americans saw the hush money case as less serious than trumps other three a quinnipiac university poll conducted in midmay found that 46 percent of respondents believed trump had done something illegal in the hushmoney payment case 29 percent said he had done something unethical but not illegal and 21 percent said he did nothing wrong and trumps allies in the gop stuck by him throughout the trial a rotating cast of elected republicans and other surrogates joined him at the lower manhattan courthouse most days the jury of seven men and five women deliberated for a day and a half before issuing its guilty verdict the panel found that trump falsified business documents that reflected a series of payments he made to his former lawyer michael cohen those payments reimbursed cohen for 130000 in hush money that he sent to porn star stormy daniels 12 days before the 2016 election at the time daniels was threatening to go public with her account of having had sex with trump a decade earlier trump with cohen as a middle man struck a nondisclosure deal with daniels to ensure her claims didnt damage his white house bid but when trump later reimbursed cohen he falsely designated the money as legal expenses in his companys books prosecutors from the manhattan district attorneys office charged trump with 34 felony counts accusing him of falsifying 11 invoice records 12 general ledger entries and 11 checks some of which were signed by trump with a black sharpie in order to find trump guilty the jury had to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt not only that trump falsified the records with a fraudulent intent but also that trump did so to commit or conceal another crime that underlying crime prosecutors argued was a violation of a new york state election law that prohibits conspiring to promote a candidate by unlawful means the hush money to daniels prosecutors said was unlawful because it violated campaign finance laws and they said trumps reimbursement arrangement to cohen violated tax laws as well
well done from the uk
appeal already being filed
pecker fatally wounded djt and the redfinch payment was the icing because they were clearly campaign expenditures that were surreptitiously reimbursed and not reported to the fec along with the payment to stormy
that was a beautiful conviction there was no other conviction like it they say it was amazing
finally some hope for my country god bless american
donald trump is a conman who is now found guilty of falsified business records the man is a criminal
trump was found guilty because chances are he is guilty
lock him up
the truth will set you free
what a beautiful day for america
all this is doing is stirring the pot hes still gonna be president
medias touch everyone cnn is trash along with fox etccnn sold the american people out

can donald trump still run for office after this
democracy died today
he will still be at biden

i really wish they would just throw trump in prison but i assume they arent out of fear that maga will go berserk start attacking innocent people destroying cities taking children hostage and say well only stop when hes given a fair trial as i bet trump and maga are going to say all of the trials were rigged
lock him up and now america will be great again
imagine if orange don got a custodial sentence that would be hilarious
should have hired sesame street dracula for the count
well i genuinely did not see this coming i expected a majority but not unanimous this is welcome news however i feel the blue touch paper has just been lit
being found guilty when youre guilty is so unfair
he shouted about hilaryrc her up
his lawyer had his head in his hands as the verdict was read perhaps he had a no win no fee deal
i do hope mrs clinton sends him a hello greeting card in prison i thought he could shoot someone here and not spend a day in jail
anyone who votes for a convicted felon for president has no scruples
truth justice the american way
still no crime that anyone can state coherently mush less demonstrate yet 34 felony convictions spun up from perfectly legitimate bookkeeping records without the slightest evidence of a crime democrats are in full attack against democracy
jake tapper counting the guilty charges reminds me of nick cage reciting the alphabet
congratulations from germany
can ya say something original don you just restate the same old blah blah blah over and over
he is a convicted felon however he still can run for president can anybody explain that one to me a convicted felon cannot vote but can run for president only in murica

trump has no one to blame but himself he should have testified otherwise

trump hires only the best lawyers
the felon who will still be the gops standard bearer the party of lawlessness
wont have to wait long for the parade of politicians crying all over themselves about this proving once again they believe in the rule of law for everyone but themselves and how they get the lemmings to follow them hook line and sinker
american justice actually worked now we the people need to fix the corrupt supreme court
president for life biden could not be reached for comment
still he can appeal win presidency willwitchunt trump2024
congratulations from the uk
finally
time to watch me some fox news lol
im reminded of that simpsons meme
at long last justice has prevailed lock him up
michael cohen did not have a prior criminal record he got 3 years lock trump up
a very sad day for putin and a very happy day for america
moral of the story if you cheat on your wife with a porn star and your attorney pays her off dont screw your attorney over by not paying him back
sad day for the miami cuban community
what a day for both seth meyers and stephen colbert to be dark
we did it we finally got him lock him up
conald chump is guilty
very much guilty
nobody should celebrate this too soon this case has now set a precedent if they want to find you guilty as charged they can using the word of a liar you could be next without any recourse just remember that the world has lost its respect for the leader of the free world
the world especially our allies are watching
yo this is just the one case hes got three more and i m sure more to come hee hee
ok so what does this mean now jail time prison time nixed from being president again
congratulations couldnt happen to a fitter person if only we could take away what hes done to scotland
trump is new breed of man the scientific name is stupidicus ultimus
if you cannot vote because youre convicted felon in some states how are you allowed to run for president in those states shouldnt trump be removed from the ballot in those states
he finally won the popular vote
yay justice has finally been served now finish the job and put him in jail where he belongs its a red letter day
this reminds me of a third world country this judge was part of the prosecution
its a shame that this may be the only thing he gets a trial and conviction for because the classified documents case and especially the georgia election interference case are a much more serious crime that he should be in prison for this stuff is just common stuff that lots of peoplecompanies do all the time and never get caught hopefully this is the beginning of the end of the trump hysteria and a lot of people snap out of it and come to their senses its time to remove the crazies and rebuild the republican party as a party that is about being conservative and small government as opposed to corruption and getting the libs
trump 2024 now he will gain more support after this rigged trial go trump
i wonder if his poll numbers will go up or down
biden in guilty should be put in prison
justice now lock his crooked ass up
do the world a favor lock him up for a year just to give us all a break from his bullshitdouche bag would you be honest the rest of the international community look on in awe the republican party needs to come clean they have been aiding and abetting a criminal moron for the past 10 odd years new candidate required urgently
all the cnn guys look sad lol i think they know we crossed a line we can never return from
someone needs to recut this with the count from sesame street and an occassional thunderclap
democracy has won in the court now lets win at the pollsbecause the fact that he can still qualify for the presidency is an absolute shame
wonder how much the jurors were paid off
i like to suggest a correction to a jury of his peers i dont think you can find a jury that is as shady fraudulent and criminal as he is
please drop out of the race
audience the jurors found 33 guilty lions tigers and bears oh my and one convicted orange felon tailor make trump a new orange suit its his new favorite color
i love democracy
im still clapping so now what is the goprnc gonna do gonna run a convicted felon lets see i dont think weve found the bottom just yet
gag order lets talk about the order
not a surprise to anyone but the maga crowd
hes free on his own recognizance dont forget he has several passports
those poor 15 secret service members on his detail must be thinking dam we all going to be on work release
is the supreme court going to still stand by this man
this will win trump the election
if this man can still be allowed to be president this country is fucked up
best news ever
we love in a country where convicted felons cannot get jobs or are allowed to vote yet this one may continue to run for president with
he should go directly to jail without passing go any one else would have been detained for gag order violations
finally finally justice has at long last been served finally the rich powerful corrupt have been forced to pay the full consequences of their scummy actions finally the american justice system did its job right finally karma got its hands entirely on that deluded tyrant finally that hugely arrogant egomanical entitled dictator found out the hard way that no one i mean no one is above the law god bless the state city of new york god bless the judge prosecutors jurors police officers fbi reporters all those that trump has wronged god bless the united states of america this is a truly glorious day
not a jury of his peers this has just begun
now the orange blob can say he the biggest felon there are big beautiful felon
trump now the official property of ny state
cant wait until june 27th welcome to the first presidential debate between president joe biden and convicted felon donald trump
so hes an illegitimate president he committed crimes to win so he cheated on his wife and the united states he stole the presidency with criminal acts
does this mean they can start making his orange jumpsuit
trump lacks any remorse and has been abusive towards the judge and court officials this has taken as a factor when sentencing so trump should be locked up
and who couldve saw this coming with that jury instruction
its a good day for america and the world damn right
what a day what a day what a day what a day not one juror disagreed
wonderful i was so sick and tired of watching that ahole skiptomloo out of everything america still works
do we see some consequences now
finally
tapper dont say anything stupid with your sneaker undercover maga azz
finally congrats from germany
donald trump is making america free of him one conviction at a time
justice has prevailed cant wait for the maga meltdown
congratulations from australia
now what i say do to him what you would do to me
this is celebration to all of us that are not rich connected people
the self proclaimed party of law and order and family values will now have to vote for a felon found guilty of fraud sexual assault defemation because of the trial brought on by his cheating on his wife
jake can we do this again but this time you do one of 34 all the way through and can you talk like the count from sesame street please pretty please
ill bet steven colbert is kicking himself for not having his live on tape shows broadcasting today bad timing steven
if he appeals he should have to do so from behind bars just like everybody else he is a convict now no going back
liberty and justice for all when you dont show favoritism based on 2 class society
in the criminal justice system sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous in new york city the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the special victims unit these are their stories
only facts count in court the clowns bluster counts for fall
not guilty by reason of stupidity will be the appeal
biden must be eating a half gallon of ice cream in celebration right now
he shouldve done that sesame street the count count one one guilty felony charge two two felony charges whahahahaha
fk i lost count already lol
he cant vote yet he can still be pres thats insane
thank you joe biden you just zoomed trump into the oval office

sad day in the ussr i mean the usa just like its right out of stalins playbook
all these statements against trumpyoutube controlledhhhmmmmmmus news media hmmmmmgovernment controlledhhhmmmmmm
i never expected this good
donalds orange face will go beautifully with his new orange jumpsuit
trump has until july 11 to run away to russia and ask putin for political asylum
obviously he was found guilty hes guilty of a lot more but like i said this wasnt going to change my vote
thank whatever deity you hold dear now remand him into custody
tragically his dumb wit followers will still vote for him in november
convicted felon donald trump
yay open the border free palestine to the river to the sea
ny jurors are just as corrupt as ny judges and prosecutors the corrupt verdict will be thrown out on appeal corrupt da bragg campaigned on getting trump corrupt judge merchan refused to recuse himself in violation of a ny statue requiring recusal corrupt lying prosecution witnesses unconstitutional gag order on trump unconstitutional indictment denial of due process unconstitutional jury instructions
the biggest sham in american history he was found guilty before the trial ever started
whenever i hear donald trump is having a bad day a little smile comes across my face
alina hanna is one hell of a lawyer i guess being pretty isnt better than being smart
justice served ive been saying for a year now trump for prison
cant say it better httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvryonsokz5ze
today we became nicaragua cuba and venezuela enjoy your life
hey tapper i guess all of psycho expert scholars was wrong
trump guilty on all 34 counts finally we have some measure of justice
why isnt his pre trial release in the other cases not being immediately revoked
democrats have no officially destroyed any confidence in the american justice system these criminals are stoking civil war
while trump is now a convicted felon he will never go to jail nevertheless trump and maga will complain of election interference and the fascist corrupt biden doj trump will insinuate the jury is tainted biden operatives and the verdict is rigged yet i am uncorking champagne best wishes america
shame on the democrats for lowering the status of our country to banana republic now we know we will be voting red all the way
no one is above the law
hunters next lol
his name should be immediately removed from every ballot this shouldnt be happening here
lmao cnn has a whole verdict counter
justice for stormy
well done america well done ny celebrating and wishing joe all the best all the way from scotland
uh nhuh thats right done mess with the united states dude trump is guilty 34 times out of
can we now call him 34 instead of 45
prosecution well done
yes yes yes way to go jurors
by this time next year trump will be in prison he will have approximately 100 convictions bt jurys of his peers at least half a dozen of his lawyers will be in prison too after either pleading guilty or being found guilty by jurys what an utter embarrassment that the republicans cant find anyone better
what a personal blow for an individual who thought he was above the law now get rid of that cannon chick and do the classified docs case run this kid outta town
im watching this from venezuela to everybody wondering this is just how the justice system works in dictatorship countries what americans are supporting right now is the way to become a new venezuela enjoy your democracy hahaha
and he will be president in 2024
but will it remove him from the ballot
i like presidential candidates who arent fellons should be an automatic disqualification
lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him suck it maga
its not over yet so dont get too excited trump will keep filling appeals until he finds a corrupt judge and there are many to reverse the verdict fallback plan would be to win the 2024 election so he can give himself a pardon democracy is still at grave risk
as the lyrics of that great chicago song say only the beginning
maga tears are so tasty
biden just lost the election
many thanks to the new york das office the courage to be the first to hold this criminal accountable
yes thank you sweet baby jesus
diaper don the convicted felon should be legally disqualified from running the us
pop the corks for law and order now for the supreme court
send his ass to prison
in the criminal justice system sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous in new york city the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the special victims unit these are their stories
no one found guilty of 34 felonys should ever be allowed to be president in our country we need to change some laws
your once twice 34 times a felon
free trump
now now now he must be marched into jail
finally
but is he going to do jail time though
falsifying legal documents is and should be a big deal in the multimillion business world now put him in prison for his crime he may be rich but he is not above the law this will show our laws are for everyone not just the middle class or lower economic class
history the world is watchingall people who believe in justice democracy are celebrating today
america truly can be great now
we shall overcome
i never expected trump to face justice
this shows just how bad cnns honig and others reporting was on this case most decent legal commentators were saying how strong the prosecution case was but cnn were too focused on creating a story to report and analyse accurately
congratulations from belgium
lock it up
and guess what life goes on
no surprise here he is guilty of much more than this he is also guilty of sucking up valuable oxygen
thank you for this new asmr that will help me sleep til the election
i like presidents who arent convicted felons
thanks nyc
it couldnt happen to a more deserving felon than trump
from australia congratulations american justice is prevailing
justice served yet hes still the presumptive republican nominee for president how pathetic is that
republican and christian here i like my presidents who know how to work around the system and not get caught great day
at least the rest of the world now knows that all of america isnt effed up
now if he can still be a presidential candidate all felons should be able to vote
thank you for handing him the win in november this is only going to make him more popular
thanks america now europe is the beacon of democracy as it should be
people are saying that no one has ever received more guilty verdicts than i have
wonderful justice served but in alternative reality drumphworld they just have created a martyr
now lets get the handculfs
no the election was not stolen and yes this trial was fair
unanimously found guilty on all charges god bless america
betcha melania was tickled pink quietly thinking one trial down fl ga yet to gothen im free
its a perfect score a perfect verdict a perfect jury a perfect judge trump is now in good company with al capone capone died from syphilis and trump has syphilis the losers are those that trump harmed and that is a huge number there needs to be a wake up call in republican land denial is not moving forward
prison now no deals no special treatment
cnn is trash
lock him up lock him up
i wish the judge would go back to trumps contempt charges and orger him to be arrested and jailed
34 freaking counts i love you guys
lock him up
the cult doesnt care
i hope to see america dancing on the street tomorrow
dont drop the soap punk
what a disgrace this weaponization of the legal system by the democratic party sickens me i will be voting for president trump on november 5th all of these charges will be turned over on appeal
trump 2024 joe biden sniffs children in open imagine what he does in private ask his daughter or even wife she held the camera while they showered you support that birds of a feather flock together
nice i thought it would end in a mistrial from a hung jury after i saw one of the jurors got his news off of truth social still im not going to celebrate unless he gets sentenced and starts serving jail time
wrap your head around this donald j trump is a _convicted felon thirty four times over_
i really have to thank trump for wearing an industrial diaper today otherwise there would have been some major spillage and stink in court today thank you trump
bet he wishes he had just written one big check for cohen
justice matters
time to start snatching wigs and passports now do cannonalto and thomas
yay the jury looked at the crazy amount of logical evidence and went right down the list and said guilty now lets see how hes held accountable for 34 felony charges i hope he gets jail time and a prison mate whos mom he evicted back in the 80s
saw this for all the cases againsttrump you have all of the overwhelmingevidence witnesses and testimonies from those republicans who worked for him andor around him phone records emails meeting logs audio tapes videos paper trails and in some cases signatures etc etc
what a beautiful day
this is so funny
its the most wonderful time of the year
wait till trump is president and gets a doj going after these people
cnn dropped the ball on this one msnbc already told us hes guilty of all charges
so possession of a firearm is now a felony for the republican presumptive nominee for president
not the hush money payment case but deceiving the american voters case
thank you 12 patriots
hes always winning this time 340 now its loss of voting rights and sentencing
fox light is sad today watching jake tapper and elie they seem sooo sad and low key angry i wonder why you can tell in peoples faces and tone whos upset about it wow cnn wow they cant even hide it
saw this regarding hush money case trump found guilty on all 34felony charges _the facts testimonies and evidence_ should be all people concentrate on and most are not to mention that these payments were made in 2016 which was indeed an absolute case of election and an interference
yes a great day for the us and the entire vote blue forever
brings a smile to my goddamn face verdict guilty of all counts
alito gots to go and promise to take crooked thomas with you
saw this from political 70 of the country rejects trumps claim that presidents should be immune fromprosecution for allegedcrimes theycommitted while in office
are you listening to the charges maga cant say you dont know what hes being charged with
no one found guilty of 34 felonys should ever be allowed to be president in our country we need to change some laws
so as a felon he is not allowed to vote join the military own a firearm and not even get a real job in many cases but he can be president how stupid are our laws
finally america can be great again
one side rejoices the other sees a third world country
well done that jury hooray from the uk he is rotten and needs to be held accountable this must be so sweet for all those americans who have been horrified by his lack of morals and hateful rhetoric
saw this from political hushmoney case half of americans believe trump isguilty 14 republicans 86 democrats 54 independents
thank you ny
trump clown he should be convicted for all lie
whoop whoop all 34 lock him up man the irony would be so delicious
rapists cannot be trusted no sht sherlock
continued the number of people who said that they believe trump isguilty in above comment was nearly identical to the results when asked respondents to consider trumpsguilt in his other threecriminal cases
im still voting for trump dummies
maybe he should have spent more time awake than sleeping in court
hes still going to be elected lol im a democrat but its so obvious this will make people support him even more the war is far from over
his wife is now free
damn mr trump has more felonies than i do and ive been a criminal my entire life
hey he cant vote
unanimous a l l t h i r t y f o u r c o u n t s thats how its done son well done jake say that slow convicted felon
joe should be found guilty for being the president
there will never be any neutral objective impartial unbiased decisions in the doj so long as it is influenced by politics the system is broken and it is impossible to fix very sad for the justice of american citizens new york just shot itself in the foot for business since the issue at hand is common practice stated by ke in oleary god bless america
way to go america nobody is above the law
donald trump created a new history todayfirst president to be convicted of criminal felonies
due to his age and being a dingus he will not spend a minute in jail if it was me id be led out of courtroom in handcuffs till sentencing hopefully the other three trials when they start dont let that turd walk away i dont know any other job that makes you immune from the law but apparently president is one
no one is above the law
damn fake tapper is only an hour late
ankle bracelet to make sure they can track him i hope
maga is celebrating finally their leader jabba won the popular vote
try not to commit any more felonies on the way to the parking lot

music to my ears guilty and guilty there is a god
trump must be so proud 34 firsts in a row records nobody has ever seen before
this made my day my week and month
the caption should read donald trump guilty of thirty four felonies
the most beautiful news ive heard in 4 years love it hahahahaha now all the lies
in the picture of trump when the guilty verdicts were read he looked like kristi noems goat
the man that is now found guilty is also the republican nominee could you just imagine what every world leader is now thinking dealing with a criminal holy
god bless america no one is above the law hopefully scotus agrees
good day for america and democracy that for you space laser believe

and the jello will slide down the wall on appeal
ladies and gentlemen we got him now only 57 criminal counts to go i like presidents who arent felons
congrats dems you just handed trump the keys to the white house
i am a senior citizen i never expected to live long enough to see an american president convicted i doubt very much i will live through another 20 years of appeals good luck america
donald succeeded in making america great again by being found guilty
do you know what if mother theresa had done all that theres no way shed have gotten away with it either
now we get to see republicans bootlickbuttlick a convicted criminal disgusting
blacks for trump
justice at its finest
this is the single greatest video ive ever seen on youtube
excellent news
vote all democrats in 2024 save the country and women rights
let the party begin dem ks
trump and his codefendants locked up already trump the blackhole that sucks in endless number of codefendants increase penalties for contempt of court 05b 2b 8b jail given accountability in jail by his codefendants finally treat trump like a prisoner and endless more charges crushing down on trump life time imprisonment not enough
guilty what a beautiful word
trump always wanted to be in the history books
thank god
oh happy day now put him in the same prison along with diddy
how is he not in jail
what color jumpsuit do you think hell pick
and the jurors came up to me big strong jurors tears in their eyes and they said to me sir we find you guilty of absolutely everything
even that one dude who got all his news from truth social thought he was guilty guess you can change someones mind if they pay attention to actual evidence this is sweet
thank you lefties for electing the 47th president of the united states and the first felon you guys had to know it would backfire
justice is finally being served
this is ridiculous this whole this is rigged a circus just to keep him from becoming president go away joe bidenyou have done nothing for me and my country still voting for trump 2024 and many people i know are still are
fantastic news now i suppose trump will trumpet that biden paid jurors bribe for their verdict hallelujah justice prevails
now lock him up
isnt it about time that the media start calling this verdict what it is all about trump trying to deceive the voters of the united states in order to become president of the us he is blabbing his mouth off again so voters beware
now his wife can live in peace
this is a good day
i honestly didnt expect them to do the right thing im shocked
and the conviction party is only just beginning
the gop has dug itself into such a deep hole over the last 78 years and they just keep digging my former party is unsavable at this point and it will take at least a generation to overcome quite possibly two generations
convicted criminals should not be allowed to run for president
this will only boost his popularity unfortunately this will motivate his cult even more it will have zero effect on him being the republican candidate
cry maga cry and then cry some more
trump wanted to go down in history but not the way he wanted
they were american citizens chosen by the prosecution and the defence who took their jobs seriouslylistened to all the evidence and came back with a unanimous guilty verdict
we called this justice if anyone else any other normal citizen would have done what trump did would be in jail this is not fair
breaking news maga moves headquarters to sing sing
this is the perfect opportunity for the republican party to extricate themselves from him
the start of the end of this scourge on american democracy congratulations usa been a long time coming
what a shame
hell still win
every contributor analyst and lawyer on this channel said this was a weak case and that trump will probably be convicted innocent but every juror said he is guilty talk about making an insane verdict when your family is threatened
hell violate the gag order again wont be able to stop his mouth and when he does judge merchan do your duty melania has it been worth it
don the convict
should there be special treatment for a popular person
so what does this mean
a perfect jury a perfect conviction absolutely perfect
finally
assuming he loses appeal looks like don the con wont be able to vote for himself come november
what happens with the gag orders
trump a republican cant offer a single defense for his failures the republican congress cant offer a single defense for their failure hogs of a feather swim in the slop together
congratulations you just made donald trump the nelson mandela of our generation
and yet the cult is still going to post nonsense like what crime
still voting for trump even if he is in prison
does this not disqualified him from the republican party nomination as a felon does this not prevent him from being president according to the supreme court
the refuse to take the stand to defend himself and then blames everyone else guilty 34 for 45
the maga tears are flowing on fauxnews
as a republican i can only ask is this what they want in the running for president of the republican party a convicted felon will be voting democrat across the board this november
great info
heres one for you scotland
great now he can start campaigning again we need trump out there talking about what a great dinner guest hannibal lecter is
baby this is history text books and law books will always hold trump in their memory
juan merchand deserves a medal after this
imagine your employee puts checks into records and an accounting procedure gets book literally two counts right there then you get blamed for it wtf
does this mean trump goes to jail
the department of justice is committed to holding accountable those who wrongly believe there is one rule of law for the powerful and another for the powerless no one is above the rule of law
trump is guilty of a lot more he is not fit to be a toilet attendant
the supreme court rules 63 that trump is dictator for life and can pardon himself
despicable disgraceful trail to say the least
couldnt have happened to a nicer orange turd
hell get an ankle bracelet just watch the judge already said he doesnt want to punish him like everyone else as he should be trump has been skirting the law for years finally caught up with him
setting a precedent now we can plan to watch biden and hunter go through the same thing only with real charges
a jury of his peers in manhattan give us a break these were all paid off democrats
this is the best news ive heard in a long timeparty time here in uk
im good with this
finally some sanity in our socalled justice system this has to put a stop to this felon and rapist in his effort to become a tyrant
michael cohen for president
es gibt noch richter in berlin a german saying about justice there are still judges in berlin the background being that a berlin jury found against the king in a civil case in the 18th century
im glad our institutions are holding
justice
trumps ratings go up againand america is divided beyond any hope at allbill clinton biden covered up hunter biden etcthe rigged jurythe rigged judicial systemthe world will burn
convicted criminal donald john trump
see ya donny rot in prison
oh what a happy happy happy happy day
this is the end of the republic as you know it pandoras box has been opened whatever it takes and the end justifies the means has destroyed throughout history and not saved
my conscious is clear i will never vote for a felon to be president of this country
ill bet he filled his diaper today
finally justice has been served cnn was supporting trump and kept bringing experts who would say confidently that there will be reasonable doubt and there will be hung jury all were wrong shame on his supporters
it will all backfire big time democrats are so corrupt
well done there is such a sense of karmic satisfaction oh let me gloat todaywe have earned a good gloat
yes now lets get him for everything else keep him out of our white house
putin is not going to be happy that his investment is now a convicted felon
we been knew that lol what we talking about his own lawyer did 3 years in part for doing this
and this changes what again his crazy cult members will still support him and now he can raise so much money off this too oh the world we all live in just crazy nuts
from australia woo hoo well done america ny has come up with the correct verdict trump is guilty
i will have the addresses of all jury members in the next hour and the judges addresses
hes a flight risk at minimum confiscate passport and apply ankle monitor for tracking better yet remand
cant wait for sentencing
now whatcan he appeal all these
stillhell be the next president who would think
well elections yet to happenso
so does he go to jail right now
justice long awaited well deserved vote blue
some stupid nasty out there after this some people who made that would be getting same thing to selves
dems will lose so badly this november unfortunately we should have never done this
watching this live was crazy it truly doesnt feel real but hey it did
real shock with lefty judge and jurors will get thrown out on appeal if he does jail time and loses the election you think anyone is going to accept the election as not rigged the country will explode the left are so desperate and pathetic
shame on people that support him
show us the mob outside the courtroom
justice is served
count 34 found guilty on thirty four felony charges muahaha cue thunderclap
one of the greatest days in american history
finally hes been held accountable for his crimes
wont stop trump from becoming the president
justice is served
thank you
lets hope the appeals court denies appeal
there was never any doubt about his guilt the interesting thing will be the sentence will he escape prison or not and then he will probably appeal it and drag it out till he is dead
get ready for a maga hissy fit
a frowned expression is that different to frowning
if it was me it would be 25 years for each charge
he simply a criminal lets not put him back in the office cuz hes just going to come back for revenge he will be a danger to the us
the chicken has come back to roost
the maximum penalty for each charge is 4 years which x 34 guilt verdicts is co incidentally just over 11220 votes i mean days
any chance i can treat the jury to take out
congratulations ooo now go to prision
usa just another corrupt south american country
today is one of the gest days in american history go justice
now try him for mishandling the pandemic plz
is it in bad taste to say lock him up
justice been served nobody is above the law history is made
the bravery of this jury will be in history books forever lock him up lock him up lock him up
cnn is so behind all other news outlet what has happened to jake and cnn
well half of us knew he was a criminal before he was ever elected president his scam university his scam charity his constant grifting his stiffing contractors his cheating on taxes we were warned there were signs criming is kinda his thing
like proximus caesar said what a wonderful day
all those jury was paid by biden this is the only way they can stop him cuz biden sucks at president
no he was convicted of el3ction interference of the 2016 election
not that it really matters
a couple of thought 1 remember that legal scholars thought this was the weakest of the four cases trump faces 2 mark my words the crooked and corrupt aileen cannon and supreme court justices will do everything in their power and beyond to protect and exonerate donald trump 3 i quit drinking ten years ago that will end tonight its a good night to celebrate

this guy spent almost 4 minutes listening each count separately when in 10 seconds he could have just said guilty on all 34 counts that is why so many people hate cnn lol

waaaaaah it will get over turned on appeal in 3 2 1 maga tears
wow who would have thought a po star would bring him down
i wanted it to be like when the council found general zod guilty at the begining of superman the movie a buch of big heads saying guilty
this jury just made america great again
why would anyone vote for a felon for president of the united states i just dont understand it if it were a democrat with all these felony charges you know it would not be allowed
all of you enjoy it while you can the last laugh is going to be on you come november
jurors walked to me crying sir guilty sir
hi there what up
i wonder what sleepy joe told the jury in deliberations to make them vote guilty his scheme is working brandon 2024 lets gooooo
which wrist will they slap
now we await the sentence it will be another crime if he doesnt do some hard time
its strange to see people celebrating this sham trial when theyve just handed the presidential election to trump theyve just increased trumps voter turnover tenfold this is going to backfire so badly on dems
thank you jurors witnesses congratulations prosecution team job well done fantastic fair judge great day for america
cnn will be milking this one hahaha they love there trump news cnn lame as hell
they stood up to him
maga airhead guilty again now felony maga
trump will never do anything great again
rigged from the beginning biggest abuse of the legal system since the rosenbergs
found guiltyso now lock up donald trump
this makes trump stronger than ever
why did jake have to read each verdict out thats just stupid cnn
damn lied about everything
ah ha the orange clown keeps making history for the wrong reasons
no other president in the history of america has been able to hit 34 of 34 counts hes the greatest felon in us presidential history no one has done more for law and order than donald trump
what an absolute joke
and guilty of election interference unanimous
i like presidents who are not convicted felons
i never thought i would see the day i doubt it will ever make up for all the damage he has caused this country
rigged crooked joe biden and the democrats ordered it now let the trumps supreme court give him immunity from prosecution that will show you who has the power
trump was told what the charges were they were read to him the first day in court _after reading them the he judge asked if he understood and he said yes_ if he didnt understand he had many lawyers to explain them to him
is he going home or to jail
send the pos to prison
come on whats a few guilty counts hes been guilty of crimes all his life so whats the big deal
justice was found now lets see if justice will be given in sentences for the felonies 34 x 4 years sounds really fitting for the crimes to me
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeessssssits a great day for america good job jurists
we all knew this was rigged and completely political
but at least the convict had his wife and daughter there to support him
it will be overturned this court wasnt even allowed to charge him trump 2024 the dementia patient has finally crossed the line if they can do it to trump they can and will do it to every american remember the biden crime bill
he will be a first for everything including first candidate elected as president with a felon
convicted felon 67 more to go cannon should be removed and disbarred in fla
those lock her up chants are sounding so ironic right about now
excellent work prosecutors and jurors a small step for the justice system a giant leap for democracy
melania poor judgement in choosing your life partner
this guy spent almost 4 minutes listening each count separately when in 10 seconds he could have just said guilty on all 34 counts that is why so many people hate cnn lol
how did a jury convict someone with a 5th grade education
all this will mean nothing if he doesnt get jail time
he volunteered for this scrutiny when he ran for president like alito and thomas they have all signed up for owing a duty to the public in exchange for the public trust thank you new york
you know who is free from jail right now because hes on bail which states defendant must remain trouble free with the law or be in violation criminal guilty verdict is definitely trouble with the law
a business documents civil case turned into a criminal trial fascist dems will stop at nothing
he could have been guilty of some of the charges but nothing indicated felony charges their defense tried to insert experts and evidence and it was rejected was the court interested in the truth or do we run a system where we run verdicts based on incomplete set of truths
i want an ai to watch this and lmk how many times he says guilty and convicted lol
convicted felon enjo prison dicator
lock him up just like they wanted for hillary
34 of 34 thank you to the fact finders
make trump guilty again
he does sound a bit ridiculous calling each count out the same over and over again
crying tears of joy guilty all charges sentencing in july i hope our country survives this
theres rejoicing in the streets here in brazil
so what he still gonna be president with peoples vote november 6th 2024
you know this is getting overturned dont get your crazy base to excited
dude is going to get off with a fine
so donald was a big loser today he was not found to be above the law
this is so stupid other countries really be shaking heads at this
wow i was not expecting this to happen im in shock
every time tapper says guilty i celebrate
the real justice will be of he is sentenced to jail or just a vacation in his florida home ie house arrest
literally shedding tears of satisfaction right now joy isnt right as its a shame this scumbag took our country to this point hope theres more healing than hatred going forward
finally some justice send trump to prison

he couldnt work in a 711 but he can be president
i have a bottle of wine ready when he is arraigned for a jail cell
he wont be able to sleep through those verdicts he wasnt taking it serious now he has to face it
there are many traditional conservatives who believe that a man banned from running a charity because he took money from disabled veterans a man that screws porn stars whilst his wife is at home nursing who calls the fallen fools and suckers who mocks the disabled found guilty of rape should not be a president let alone anything else he is a repulsive excuse for a human being
this place just got even more interesting

for the jurys safety please remind everyone that trump and his lawyers all picked and approved the members of the jury so if the jury is unfit he has no one else to blame
taxpayers should not be paying for secret service for a serial criminal and his family

corrupt conflicted politically motivated disgraceful yes donnie boy thats you
its so nice to see the former 1st lady melania trump standing next to her 4 times indicted 3 times married 2 times impeached 1term disgraced president every time during his trying times
cultist are annoying
brilliant outcome what a douche bag of a man love from the uk
why is the cnn reporter sound like shes about to start crying as she describes trumps reaction during the reading of the verdict seriously unprofessional
from my perspective it was a pretty open and shut case
what took cnn so long
lets see if he actually sees any time for this thats the real test
nobody knew being convicted could be this serious
hope they look after his painful bone spurs in jail
