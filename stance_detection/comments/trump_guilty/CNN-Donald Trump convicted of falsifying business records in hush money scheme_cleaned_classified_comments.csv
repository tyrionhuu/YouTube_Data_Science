to those who are willing to listen along time ago there was a man who hated the government he was loved for the way he revolted against those who sat in power by his words and acts he led to many violently atrocities for his nation though the government would rather avoid bloodshed they wished to hold their authority unchallenged so this man brought out the worst in them they would violently harass the peoplewhile looking for him even if people were innocent they would be harassed just for the warning of what would happen if they discovered something about this man eventually the man was captured and sentenced to death but something unexpected happened awhile later there was another who went out to help others he would heal the sick feed the hungry and would help those many believed were beyond help this challenged the government in a different way because now this one wasnt crossing the line they wouldnt cross for evil but was crossing the line they wouldnt regarding helping others the people dragged this one to a judge and seeing that the cause was out of envy the judge gave the people a choice they could either have this one released who had done no wrong or they could have the man that lead to the lands desolation set free but the people would not allow their eyes to be opened so they allowed the man to be sent free and had the healer sentenced to death the one who was set free was given the name barabbas and the one who was sentenced to death was named jesus this is the storm the world faces today for 4 years the one who is condemned now has not been in office and many plead for his judgement and condemnation still and some still love the chaos he caused and want his authority to return so they may reap the benefit of it but very few see that the court room has been recreated again just as it was barabbas and the son of man known as jesus for no one who truly knows the son of man denies his words and he willingly allowed himself to die because he didnt want man to succumb to being unforgiving and merciless beings for any cause for that causes them to decay away many may be healed at this time if they count the cost from where they have fallen and build back up by valuing what they have heal those who are suffering do not commit to violent protests and the actions which follow them forgive without turning off wisdom search for how you may do these things with gentle hearts even though it will be a hard road regardless a gentle pace makes the work easy many say now that it is not as dark as it was during years before because many deaths are not occurring but the amount of unforgiveness is higher now than it has been before and the loss of life is a small result which will come compared to the other consequences the world is facing now leave stories like this alone storms like this will come and they will come again but take each day one step at a time and you will have heard the reason the son of man was willing to die so many may find life even beyond death the way the truth and the light the bread of life the home of love the joy of a child the language of the eternal nation the written words which shall not pass away the building blocks which one may use to unlock the doors where anything is possible the blood of the lamb john 115 genesis 13 genesis 9816 exodus20117 matthew 1 matthew 4 matthew 57 matthew 91017 mark124144 luke 74050 matthew 13 matthew 19 matthew 222346 matthew 2325 matthew 281620 luke 101742 luke 23612 john 753811 john 84859 john 1317 john 3 revelations 11 revelations 16 dont let the apathy of the world cause you to loose hope this is the spirit of the frog where no moment of darkness is worth being thirsty for the love of light and when no moment of light is worth letting go of the darkness one loves to hold onto but the spirit of the son of mans words will heal anyone who is willing to accept them then you are ready to turn the page onward to the last chapter toward a beginning without end revelations 22 those who are trained in the light the entire book is at hand count where you are so you may help yourselves and those who will go with you revelations 122,NONE,NONE

i explained over four years ago d trump was the last trump of god the warning that everyone needs to get their heart right with god or go down with him and biden who is bidin his time so the people can return to the truth and be set free christianity missed it too why because like judaism who missed it first they teach by the carnal mind the enemy of god the seed of the serpent the false prophet all religions teach by this method which is why the heart remains the beast that goes through all kingdoms and nations without being transformed into man in gods image and likeness that man is jesus god forms himself into man jesus within our heart the full stature of the inner man of our heart christians dont teach this adam is messiah he is the first adam in whom we died and he will be the last adam in whom we are made alive when adam becomes messiah as planned before the foundation of the world god didnt change his mind adams son is the born again adam the last adam the son of man and we are all members of his body we all become the living stones built upon the cornerstone christ anointing the yachidaonly son so the house temple never falls again the living stones the holy and royal priesthood david and aaron are the way god hashem builds his final temple the tabernacle of david a house of prayer for allllllll nations peoples egos will all fall because the ego is gog of magog the mountain of the mountains that will all be laid low by god when messiah the anointing rises within us bringing adam son of man to life along with moses elijah the prophets everyone god will suddenly rise in his temple his stony hearted people and in an instant he will destroy their vessel of vanity their ego and win the war of gog and magog so where do the jews fit in the jew is the circumcised heart of adam eve in whom we died hence the heart is wicked above all things and when this heart gives birth to the messiah anointing because he is not a physical man but gods image and likeness hence a life giving spiritual man vov in yhvh who is born through the heart to reveal the abomination of desolation in the heart holy place where it ought not be mathew 24 and once the abomination of desolation in the heart is revealed the anointing destroys it dan 9 because there is enough oil to cleanse the inner court or holy place hanukkah so eve the heart becomes the mother of all living when the heart is circumcised by the messiah who also gives life to her husband the carnal mind because this is adams curse since adam is the mind that fell to bring nothing good from the earth the serpent was created crooked by god and is adams will and the crooked is made straight by the messiah or the oil because it lifts the serpent up here is the resurrection of all three adam eve the serpent a three fold chord that will not be easily broken again if adam does not find the anointing within himself through all his members the stony hearts israel from the good ground mark 4 john 16 which is judah who took a vow to bring the anointing the good root of adam to the world nahum 115 then there will be a dead adam just recycling through dust dust dust because the dust is the serpents meat all its life to overcome hell death and the grave adam eve and the serpent have to rise above the dust and it is through the anointing through the messiah if i had not experienced this i would not know it was true but since i did on the jewish feast days of 1992 i know its true ignored for 31 years only proves that nobody wants to hear or see messiah because he ruins the party of self of the vessel of vanity that has its own ideas about how things will go through politics and religion that just keep making everything and i mean everything worse every day every minute the crooked serpent yetzer hora lashon hora does not love you hashem loves you but the serpent does not love hashem do not kid yourself that he loves him he may not be able to do anything outside of hashems will but hashem has given him free reign over you till you do teshuvah repent back to the good root of adam the messiah if you cant see his free reign as all the problems in the world then you can stay in exile with him hashem will allow it till he destroys him along with all the people who prefer him the carnal cursed mind seed of the serpent and false prophet just spins tales and more tales and never comes to the knowledge daat of the truth because it can not know the truth or god or the things of god and yet the world goes after him and all his nonsense and there is no one well i am here but there is no ear to hear me no one else can explain how to repent and where the messiah arise from within us because messiah went into exile with adam as a seed but he wont rise till we deny the yetzer hora and till we do teshuvah repent back to the good root that is within us but we ignore it in favor of the evil root that rules through our heart and to tovias viewers amazed at his intelligence speaking of how wonderful they have it because they know the true god hashem i say if you were tasting the lord you would not be close to ww3 i cant believe the strong delusion of people in religions all of them all

donald trump was found guilty thursday of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star making him the first former president to become a convicted felon the unanimous verdict from the 12person jury ends a sixweek trial in which prosecutors accused trump of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election as the jury foreperson read the verdict trump looked toward the jury box after the foreperson finished reading the verdict the former president looked straight ahead appearing somewhat red in the face then as the jurors individually confirmed that they agreed with the verdict trump stared at them it now falls to the judge justice juan merchan to determine trumps sentence he scheduled the sentencing for july 11 four days before the republican national convention begins falsifying business records carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison but because the crime is nonviolent and trump has no prior convictions any prison time is far from guaranteed merchan could opt instead for home confinement probation or a milder form of supervised release trump is certain to appeal the verdict a process that could take many months or even years meanwhile he stands accused of additional wideranging criminal conduct in three other cases two for subverting the 2020 election results and one for hoarding classified documents after he left office but none of those cases appears likely to go to trial before election day despite its historic nature there is scant evidence that trumps conviction in the hush money case will drastically alter his prospects in the 2024 race he has a small lead over president joe biden in many swingstate polls a lead that held steady throughout the trial one reason for the likely lack of fallout is that the payoff at the center of the case and the events surrounding it have long been publicly known the wall street journal first revealed them in 2018 and since the trial was not televised the details of the legal proceedings have remained opaque to many voters recent polls have shown that most americans saw the hush money case as less serious than trumps other three a quinnipiac university poll conducted in midmay found that 46 percent of respondents believed trump had done something illegal in the hushmoney payment case 29 percent said he had done something unethical but not illegal and 21 percent said he did nothing wrong and trumps allies in the gop stuck by him throughout the trial a rotating cast of elected republicans and other surrogates joined him at the lower manhattan courthouse most days the jury of seven men and five women deliberated for a day and a half before issuing its guilty verdict the panel found that trump falsified business documents that reflected a series of payments he made to his former lawyer michael cohen those payments reimbursed cohen for 130000 in hush money that he sent to porn star stormy daniels 12 days before the 2016 election at the time daniels was threatening to go public with her account of having had sex with trump a decade earlier trump with cohen as a middle man struck a nondisclosure deal with daniels to ensure her claims didnt damage his white house bid but when trump later reimbursed cohen he falsely designated the money as legal expenses in his companys books prosecutors from the manhattan district attorneys office charged trump with 34 felony counts accusing him of falsifying 11 invoice records 12 general ledger entries and 11 checks some of which were signed by trump with a black sharpie in order to find trump guilty the jury had to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt not only that trump falsified the records with a fraudulent intent but also that trump did so to commit or conceal another crime that underlying crime prosecutors argued was a violation of a new york state election law that prohibits conspiring to promote a candidate by unlawful means the hush money to daniels prosecutors said was unlawful because it violated campaign finance laws and they said trumps reimbursement arrangement to cohen violated tax laws as well,NONE,NONE
