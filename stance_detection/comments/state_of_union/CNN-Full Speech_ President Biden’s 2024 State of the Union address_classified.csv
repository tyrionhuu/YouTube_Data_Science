funny how everyone in the comments are so blinded and delusional by the bickering of two sides of the dictatorship authoritarianism political parties may i remind everyone that hitler himself was a national socialist wanted socialism through all the whole world while he was trying to take it over democrats want socialism and they want authoritarianism which is against the constitutional rights and is against everything our forefathers fought for republicans dont even know what theyre talking about half the time either because theyre always talking crap about their opposites such as a democrats which they are also talking crap about their opposites which are the republicans everyone needs to wake up an escape the matrix that was put in place for them by the authoritarian tyrannical elites who occupied our country and started taking it over during operation paperclip after world war ii when we took 35000 nazi scientists from germany and they helped us with nuclear technology and everything else warner von braun who is an extremely highranking nazi with hitler was in fact the creator of nasa and we all know nazis were extremely good at propaganda back in world war ii thats how they got everyone to start hating jewish people you need to realize that there is a government institution that disseminates false information and that is not looking out for the welfare of the people this all started back whenever operation paperclip took place the nazis started infiltrating every inch of our government from space programs to our military political parties and everything else that has to do with our government and how i know this is because eisenhower one of our past presidents warned of a military industrial complex that basically wants to continue forever wars to enrich the political elites he basically warned of the stuff that would eventually happen today democrats and republicans are never going to stop fighting thats why we need to vote for rfk and stop this division and come together as americans and strip the political elites from the power of authoritarianism neither side knows what theyre talking about theyre all afraid that theyre going to be stopped from the evils that theyre doing everyone needs to watch the movie above majestic the full movie documentary it will enrich your minds and your conscience you all need to research robert f kennedy junior because the kennedys were the only presidents in human history that were actually trying to cause mass positive change to the world and country republicans and democrats are the two dictatorship authoritarian tyrannical political parties that are trying to rule the world and cause new world order both sides have been slowly infiltrated by literal nazisrockefellers and the rothschilds wake the up already,NONE,NONE

the resident of the usa spoke many lies in his state of the confusion address here are some of the nonsense he spewed the state of confusion lies with the resident of the white house the resident of the usa and his party only say what they want people to believe but not what they actually do he said so many lies they dangle a carrot giving a pittance to this group and that just to pay for them to vote demoncrap and it usually turns out to be a lieas they are mostly lawyers knowing full well that much of what they say will not actually happen it is similar to the devil asking each person i will give you this if you just vote to mrer babies also the resident and his admin ruined bankrupted america with ieg and war he got rid of all safeguards against the border and then when his voters finally understood what problems this causes the problems we were already talking about even prior to trump taking office now he says that he is going to do something about the problem as though he is wonderful to correct a problem he caused the resident and his admin are always undermining the american constitution and citizens rights as laid out for us in the bill of rights what took the dems that are now crying about the problems of ieg so long to open their eyes and contemplate the economic damage that such a horrible policy would manifest throughout our society in so many ways it was what we had all known it was all obvious how much more damage will be done to our country before the dems wake up in addition are the demoncraps really so dumb that they dont think if you overtax corporations or make them feel overtaxed that those persons which provide goods and services will just make the same or more profits by increasing their prices they need to start using the brain god gave them they each have one and need to stop sharing one brain no the dems creating these policies know what why they are doing it rather it is the dems voting for them that have their brains shut off to doing real research and finding out the truth all the people voting for them do is believe the repetitive propaganda that is just what they want you to do dont wake up just keep believing the headlines dont do any research past the mainstream news and 9999 of this side of the aisle is not against ivf another lie it would be a good idea to stop using aorion as birth control we do not ban books that is another liewe get stuff that was once considered porn out of schools porn is wrong but it is legal for adults not people under 18 yrs of age get the facts stop repeating the lies they want you to believe and start researching the truth in the freedom to vote act has legalese written into it which gives illegals the right to vote that is wrong the citizens of the country vote for their country they came in illegally and then that is the type of people you want in your country people who start out committing a crime this is one of the main reasons the biden admin allowed so many illegals into the country and gave them a bunch of free living expenses and places to live they get 1000 a month and a free place to live do you have a free place to live do you get 1000 a month wake up it is all just in order to make it possible that these persons would vote for the carrot being dangled in front of them these are corrupt democrats deluding the votes of the real citizens and paying for votes by essentially people of other countries and how sad for that dad steve nikoui gold star family who lost a child due to bidens awful exit from afghanistan to be arrested when he yelled after he heard biden exclaim a liethat america is safer now than when he took office when illegals are attacking police raiding homes king and rping you all here that vote demoncrap are asleep at the wheel real christians research the truthnot hearing the truth here shocking that the commentary is not explaining how the border bill and other bills is a tiny tiny amt of money in comparison to the majority of the money allocated in biden admin bills is for bankrupting americans out of their taxes by protecting other countries borders and not our own thats why the congressionals on the other side of the aisle do not vote rather do not want to vote for most of what the demons put forward you all here in this video keep the truth hidden why it has been a game for the hiden lien briben coniven biden admin to make huge bills with a laundry list of items bankrupting americans and funding other countries part of the money sent to ukraine each month is aprx 20000000 just to pay for their administrations salaries pensions thats just a fraction of our money that they get it is bribery money to keep the war going so that ukraines government does the bidding of the biden regime just imagine if they put the same amount of money into helping and fixing the problems here in our own country instead of funnelling it to many other countries the bidens have hidden and not paid their fair share they are corrupted with all the money they have received from thier deceptive involvements with other countries the audacity of joe saying that people should pay their fair share when his family members and himself have hidden money and not put it on their tax reports not small amounts huge amounts it has been documented of bribery with ukraine company and now do you wonder why so much money is given to ukraine to keep people in the know so happy with money that they will not speak up when are you all going to stand up for the constitution and the bill of rights and the needs of

russiaukraine why we need trump and what biden has done to the foreign policy setting us back 50 years putting us at risk of ww3 if you google washington examiner and gunnar heinsohn you will see some articles i helped gunnar write this is not a youth bulge war it is instead an oligarch war between two mafias one in kiev and one in moscow i have been to both countries both are extremely corrupt and ukraine even more so than russia no election results can be trusted people in these two countries buy anything particularly in ukraine and that is why we never trusted their qualifications because they simply bought them biden and blinken have blood on their hands because they put putin in an impossible position causing him to invade it is as if napoleon had stationed troops in scotland and the anglonormans in edinburgh and the border regions asked england for help as the highlands government was outlawing english and taking over the industry in the more prosperous south we the english would have invaded in this analysis nato is napoleon the russian are the english the highlanders are the western ukrainians and the edinburgh people are the prosperous eastern ukrainians it is even easier because unlike scottish and english who are different peoples the ukrainians are largely all russian and one in three families in kiev have close relatives in moscow the entire biden provoked war and this genocide of russian and ukrainian men the consequent alienation of russia incresse in nuclear war inflation food and energy in europe with cost of living crisis all could have been avoided you simply need trump to get both mafia families around the table and the war could be stopped in one week this war was deliberately created by biden to get silly americans who believe russia is the soviet union to vote for biden he is trying to dupe voters who are white because all of them are with trump,NONE,NONE

this was not a state of the union address he hardly mentioned america or how we are probably bcz its doing so badly economy border government spending in foreign aid is out of control spending on illegal border crossers is out of control we give them more than we give our veterans its sick biden dared to say he wants to launder even more money through the ukraine we already pay all their ems we pay all police fire we pay the pensions of the people who live there what about americans i dont mean the ones that crossed the border this past few years we all know hes spending multi millions if not billions im sure by now on the 9 million that we know of who crossed in the last 35 years drug cartels are operating in all 50 states now i wouldnt be surprised if biden was making a commission he sure knows they charge 8 thousand to get a person across the border whats his cut i wonder maybe hunters next laptop will tell us that biden constantly says how he hates half of the americans how we are no dam good in his eyes he wonders why he cant win our vote lol he talks about the riot on jan 6 yes it was terrible no worse then the riot hamas supporters just had at the capital everyone on jan 6 was unarmed you cant over throw a government when everyone is unarmed hell biden himself said it would take more than an ar15 to over throw the government bcz they have tanks planes nukes so how unarmed does he think anyone was a serious threat it was a dam riot stop acting like we are stupid dont know that no one was charged with insurrection not one person just trespassing for the most part the riot was terrible yes but nothing like the civil war where millions died or like pearl harbor stop thats so disrespectful to those who truly lived or died in those the riot was as bad as the summer riots well no not really bcz police stations court houses where actually set on fire people where not just rioting over that summer they used lasers to blind cops they threw bricks at officers those in the crowd they froze water bottles hit officers in the head face with them that was far far worse jan 6 officers waved people in at first the video shows they all followed cops stayed inside the red ropes ive watched hours of footage it was when police began launching flash bangs into the crowd just outside the capital one officer tried to stop it on the video he said doing this will be like stirring up a hornets nest the other cop said thats the idea one flash bank exploded in a mans face ripping the side of his face off i saw it thats when people got angry combative so they wave them in fbi capital police about 200 they say were dressed as trump supporters some were in the capital prior to letting real supporters in the video shows once they had them inside they sent flash bangs into the crowd angering the crowd getting the response they wanted nancy pelosi who refused the national guard trump offered oddly nancy had her own film crew consisting of her daughter several others in order to document the insurrection she famously said to the camera she was going to punch a sitting president video shows her camera crew which was not normal for her to have there press yes her own crew documenting the day no it was a set up trump told supporters in his speech go to the capital to peacefully patriotically let your voices be heard as he said that the first group of people were already being waved in by capital police the people who went in were not even there for the speech they already were at the capital ashley babbit an unarmed veteran of our armed forces was gunned down with no warning she was unarmed not a threat she was hardly 54 the officer who murdered ashley an unarmed woman veteran was not fired not tried like the officer who had his knee on george floyds shoulder blade as george odd on enough fentynl to kill 11 people the coroner said that cop we put away however this also unarmed woman not posing a threat with out any verbal warning like get down or ill shoot police officer no he hid behind a side door in the video you can see the barrel of the gun pointing toward the group of unarmed people trying to push open the outer doors in the hall ashley was not pushing as a witness next to her would say she was just caught up in the crowd as they pushed forward they pushed her forward the shot with no warning rang out entering ashley dropping her immediately those near her tried to render aid the officer who murdered her did not come forward at all she died on the floor in the capital that she served in the military for the man who murdered her not fired but labeled a hero which is so shameful her poor family she deserved better from a country she believed in her murderer deserved to stand trial just as much as the cop involved in george floyds death was thats what would have been fair if we still had the america where lady justice was blindfolded had a scale sadly tho lady justice no longer has a blindfold at all she peeks out if youre not a democrat well then justice is not for you in fact lady justice will be used to get you if you dare not be a dem democrats murdered committed arson tore cities apart it was reported as mostly peaceful as the cities burned to the ground stores were looted public donated funds that kamala harris herself donated to until no cash bail was put in place so they could get back out there burn cities dems actually cheered that on saying they shouldnt stop harris said conservatives have one riot its ok to murder one who was totally unarmed unaware a cop even was there pointing a gun at her she had no chance at all in ny donald trump was fined 350 million climbing over 80 grand a day in interest for doing something every developer does so says kevin oleary many others no one lost money no victim in fact the bank would like to do more business it was good for the bank for ny there were no damages in history no one has been charged for this then on top of that to go for 350 million we no longer have a true justice system at all if it can be used like this against political rivals whose next we should all be afraid no one should do business in ny after this the risk is far too high other states are more rational dont use the law to grind an axe or get even thats not america its sad that it is ive lost hope in our country then fanni as well went to dc met with biden before going after trump again a which hunt its like stalin show me a man ill show you a crime they campaigned on finding something to prosecute him for that is a disgrace not how the law should be allowed to work whose next so when republicans are in the white house can we start finding some crime that no one has ever been charged with just to get our opponent thats just it they know we wont bcz we respect the rule of law love america im sick over what has happened the rot the one sidedness both in reporting in mainstream media the law ashley babbit deserved justice instead her mother is getting arrested its a very sad time to be an american my father fought as a marine in ww2 im glad hes not here to see all of this what became of the country he loved the party he use to believe in i dont like donald trump personally i do know i my family was far better off when he was president i had no debt i didnt even have credit cards i never needed any the last 4 years are the worst i have 4

right now biden could reinstate the remain in mexico policy or let texas defend its own border how is that republicans faults biden could literally stop the invasion at our border right now but he wont because he needs those new voters educated middle and lower class will vote for trump the uneducated migrants vote democrat i also voted democrat for 4 terms before i got a degree in political science ask a democrat 3 laws biden has passed and explain what they do im always on the chat board and i only ever find people who think joe is gonna help woman voters or gonna help minorities or he is for the colored people his politicized vendetta is infact against women interest and minority voters women now make 70 what men make under trump women made 95 democrats just hope that they can stir people up with a speech to go vote them into power so they can sale our country and continue committing insider trade i care about each and every american so im going to put some effort into this real quick degree in political science small buissness owner black voted for biden im not affiliated with any party i just vote based on policies everyone ive met that voted for biden couldnt tell me a single law he passed or any details if they knew the names i started college in 2020 for political science i am voting for trump because of how much biden lies versus trumps ability to speak his mind see joe biden is not the president everything he says is off of a teleprompter every word and action is written by his massive investors he said trump had 1000000 covid deaths but he ended at 400000 according to john hopkins in 2022 during bidens term we hit 1000000 this is an example of how he is hoping most people will just be naive and not fact check him or the media protecting him joe biden is who you elect if you are an oligarch or the top 1 trumps average unemployment was 4 vs bidens average at 416 which means biden even though its just 16 actually infact had a higher average and considering trump had the height of covid 19 that says a lot again biden is banking on the media and partisan dissidents and feeble mindedness to stay in power he has to run again because he clearly over promised investors and now he is in trouble he will bring us into a war to aid a nazi country and i went to ukraine myself to check it out they do infact believe they are a superior race you probably dont know that a protest like jan 6th happened in ukraine in 2015 but they actually overthrew the government so yeah everything putin said was correct and we have been arming a group of nazi extremist that raided and killed their own elected officials hunter biden was there during the time being paid 70000 a day when he was sitting on the board now worth 150000000 its like when you watch your favorite sports team commit a foul you know its a foul but you argue against it the same is with politics partisan dissidents is 60 more likely in democratic voters than republican because democratic voters go for minority groups even though democrats founded and control the kkk and every policy they pass is against minorities if you are a minority voting blue then you have been played just like i was for decades i voted blue 4 terms then started college in 2020 got a degree in political science now i realize that if i want a better life for myself and my fellow colored family then i will voter for trump if you pay attention to the comments you will see how brainwashed people are by talking against a political party instead of talking about the issues at hand just like how we completely ignored the american hardships and gloated for 2hours about lies next presidential term im gonna go for nikki haley again im not affiliated with any party i just vote for what the president will pass but its extremely concerning when im watching both right leaning and left leaning platforms and i never see voters explaining policies or discussing the materials they just claim to be affiliated with that particular party as a social statement because they are insecure about being called racist which is ironic because democrats formed and operate the kkk which is the organization that killed martin luther king white people are insecure about their stance on civil rights but the honest answer is that if we just stopped talking about race there wouldnt be any racism but for some reason the creates a great race hating tactic to earn minority voters which is why joe biden is flooding our country with immigrants and taking away voter id or drivers liscence to vote so those migrants who will be loyal to joe biden in there minds for letting them come into the country and paying them 1200 monthly will give them majority of the house again and give biden loyal voters because he knew that the educated americans which is a good portion of the population would realize everything he says and does is lies and scripted by the companies oppressing us,NONE,NONE

much uncle joeyjoe also campaigning for our presidential candidacy nomination just as well so hoping you dont mind the selfpromoting and advertising please let me know if you do yours president joe biden team mercury lets bring our pride back to our united states of america lets make america better again why does our sex offender registry have over 60000 in our registry here in the portland metropolis alone but only 1000 are registered its common sense issues like these that our fellows believe have been wellestablished decades ago when in reality were at basic level on so many pressing issues and also this is one that will surely get funded https sexoffenders oregon govconditionsofuse when i become vice president the first thing id do is sign off on a couple crucial executive orders focused on mental health and wellness in our leading enforcement positions hiring therapists and or psychiatrists per precinct with a clientdoctor confidentiality keeping our officers on the force and maintaining a nonbias nonmandated reportertype basis reprimanding retraining not removing hiring at least 1 law professional per state to mitigate negligible reoccurring persons and cases to escalate and determine an equitable fair outcome prior to allornothing offenses occur to aid not necessarily make life changes or decisions mandating cdltraining and potentially hiring process mitigation within our prison system and a broaderscaled technical training within our jail system as well as hiring at the very least a graveyard crew of 7 per state maintaining our countrys registry these i wholeheartedly believe key when building upon holding and in keeping a career there should never be despondency if theres an issue should we not be alotted to onthejob training if theres emotional turmoil should we not be alotted onthejob resources if were to be hired initially should we not have job security in every job position then theres border protection which is absolutely imperative key fundamentals of democratic policies like maintaining womens rights my body my choice in her right for an abortion equality in the workspace and full equality in general fighting for our citizens and trying to be the voice for everyone lowering our deficit focusing on climate change in every aspect from agriculture and permaculture to species on the brink of extinction rehabilitation and reassimilation to finding better pesticide and insecticide products that wont harm our critical benign insects like pollinators and seasonal nomadic to stopping any new big oil and gas development agreements working with all our world leaders to create policies best for us as the united states of america but also best for our world globally and so much more i would change so much of our marginalized communities as i can surely stress that its these citizens who take the brunt from every level the disparages of our system can seem unbearable and starting from the bottom all the way to the top one step at a time is how well enact a more equitable society but im still too young vp only we need to come together as the united states of america namely we all must work if weve need supplement of our govt as nationals we must volunteer at the least strictly in maintaining our society every one of us united states of america nationals deserve housing a job and financial aid maintaining one designated building in the heart of every downtown in every city to supply these needs will promote so much growth in such a rough market that we do currently face building upon our democratic leadership that i follow in direct cadence we must focus on police reform criminal reform and in fixing our mental health system building upon from the bottom to the top the middle out focusing on creating jobs in all sectors in semiconductors food processing manufacturing and absolutely focusing on bad banking practices and in fixing these issues in predatory lending triple loans reliance on corporations too big to fail then theres even housing reform 1 deed per citizen and or persons with dependents negotiable not mandatory implementations1 house 1 apartment complex 1 lease 1 corporation 1 entity 1 building highrise simple its clear to see that the real estate market is leading our economy and society without a single thread of oversight and its with shortsighted policies like these that skew misrepresent and shatter the current divide of our current american society immigration reform process and deportation with a negotiable warning or added criminal charges if the subject is already within the system and these undocumented crossings are continuous refugee asylum reform strict background check and applicating process case management oversight with weekly 1 hour appointments mandatory job seeking 3 per appointment governmental subsidies never be granted 10 years supplemental housing never be granted 10 years filibuster reform perfect proposals instrumental acts lifechanging bills imperative amendments that are yielded on the floor with a system in place of votedupon of yeays or nays unless unanimous theyre dead on arrival and the only pressure we have is filibustering eliminating motions that bring bills to the senate floor eliminating filibustering amendments and eliminating the noeffort filibuster would give every senator a voice but not a veto homelessness initiatives 1public loos in every city 2public electrical outlets in every city 3public laborready locales to work for at least 2000day in every city as these basic necessities are not only overlooked but unprovided as it stands whereas public defication is illegal whereas loitering is illegal whereas businesses bar our public from even using their services without exchanges of monies whereas finding 3 pennies is all thats promised from walking any citystreets for 24hours corporate credited reform many corporations have enabled refinancing loans credit aprs that at least

i just want to remind the members of congress and the american people that if every citizen were to trace their family history they will discover a migrant as is the definition of a person who immigrates somewhere on their family tree the exception is the native american people whose families came across the baltic straits so long ago there are no records the second exception is certain people whos family were unwillingly stolen from their homes and brought to this country as slaves who were not treated with the decency every human deserves and for whom adequate records were not kept then look at some of our migrant citizens who came seeking asylum and enriched in some way our country just to name a few that you might have heard their name before albert einstein nikola tesla sonia sotomayor madeleine albright henry kissinger sigmund freud frida kaloh andrew carnegie jonas salk irving berlin mila kunitz and gloria estefan just to name a few so when we scream fuss and fearmonger about letting a migrant enter our country maybe consider that first american in your family and where you might be now if the american government had refused that family member to enter and become a citizen because someone was screaming your family member was just going to sell drugs attack people rape women and kill people all without ever knowing a single thing about you family the people who show up at our borders legally requesting asylum are not the people we need to fear you dont show up and go through legal channels while hiding a bunch of drugs in what few supplies you could carry i mean look at our current citizens we have a person who managed to get voted in as potus who has been found libel for sexual assault and fraud and those are just the civil trials now as he appears to become more and more demented every day he has to face the criminal charges against him as of this day the count is 4 indictments encompassing 91 felony charges and he is the person still controlling a large number of republicans in congress federal and state if that is not the prime example of the pot calling the kettle black then i dont know what to say he is claiming the migrants immigrants will commit the same types of crimes that he has allegedly committed and some for which he has been found civilly liable also when did it become acceptable for members of congress to just yell out disrespectful disruptive and disparaging remarks at the potus while he is giving his address to the nation because it sure seems as if we have elected some white trash to congress based on the actions i witnessed when did it become acceptable for the speaker of the house to sit behind the president and roll his eyes and making sneering faces while the president who has done more for this country in the last 3yrs then the prior president did for himself while he was in office because the lord knows that he didnt do one thing for this country unless he andor his kids benefited in some way i have to say mr johnson that your obvious disdain for a man who has given a lifetime service to this country compared to the person you dont only back but revere in such a way that it is sacrilegious and disgraceful much as your lord and savior donald j trump a man who thought his popularity as potus was based on how high his tv ratings were when he demanded time on every major channel so that he could ramble on declaring himself a genius without equal declaring he knew more than not just every expert in the room but every expert in the world instead of his popularity as president being based on public opinion this man donald j trump has proven over and over again that he is unable to complete a sentence without lying how can you and your colleagues who have proven over the last year that your formerly great party is impotent by not managing to stop the infighting the bickering and the cat fights within your party long enough to pass a single bill you have a lot of chutzpah to listen to a man who has been held liable for sexual assault and fraud and is still having to defend himself in four indictments against 91 felony charges you are supporting a man listening to a man and following the demands of a man who is facing serious criminal charges and blocking every move in congress that the dems and independents support all to appease a man who is showing ever worsening mental issues so i ask why what do you see in a narcissistic misogynistic paranoid man with borderline personality disorder and increasing dementia who still seems to think if he declares something that makes it not just right but law i think president lincoln is rolling over in his grave with all that mr trump has done to lincolns party i just dont get why you would support such a disgusting dangerous and despicable human being,NONE,NONE

to avoid another global conflict it is crucial to examine and possibly adjust us foreign policy a potential nuclear war looms on the horizon the possibility of a nuclear war hangs ominously in the balance the us is the only country whose foreign policy could have as destructive an impact as a fullscale nuclear war dont push russia the outcome wont be pleasant within the realm of global politics the us stands out as the sole nation whose foreign policy has the potential to yield consequences that are a fullscale nuclear war dont force china the situation is increasingly alarming with a looming threat to china that must be subsided the united states exaggerated belief in its military dominance built on questionable foundations has escalated global tensions to the brink of an allout war over the last three decades the heightened infallibility of policymaking has increased the risk of a catastrophic mistake leading to a momentous and potentially apocalyptic war underestimating russia in terms of nato expansion and ukraine policy constitutes a disastrous error that has proven to be a catastrophic mistake both china and russia have progressed to the point where dominance is no longer feasible or nearly impossible bluffs are no longer marketable for those who have emerged as significant superpowers as a nuclear conflict looms precariously in the balance the world is moving closer to the brink of catastrophic nuclear warfare which has severe global repercussions that extend beyond china russia and the usa when it comes to interacting with other superpowers the need for increased assurance can sometimes have unintended consequences at this moment the conflicts are severe and pressing indeed russia has made it clear that it does not intend to start conflicts or increase tensions russia has expressed its willingness to deescalate the situation with nato and they have also committed to not expanding further in the region regrettably the majority of subservient leaders in europe are conventional and devoid of tactical rigor emmanuel macron the president of france stated his commitment to preventing russia from winning the war macron ranks second in europe in terms of buffoon status following zelensky he merely elicits amusement from him it is crucial to examine and adjust its potential to avoid to prevent the next world war it is imperative to address and potentially alter us foreign policy if the us does not modify and adjust its power postures no one can prevent it except the us,NONE,NONE
