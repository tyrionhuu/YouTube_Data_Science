i noticed how biden instead of taking ownership of the border crisis and promising swift action just kept blaming the republicans over not passing a border bill thats full of excessive unrelated pork barrel spending in reality joe biden needs no socalled border bill to act as president of the united states he directly controls the border patrol ice and other elements of border security he can order his border agents to do things to prevent many of the border crossings from happening in the first place and sign an executive order calling for the immediate deportation of the rest border security is a fundamental part of the presidents job in his service to the country thats what hes tasked to do the notion that he needs a bill passed before he can do his job of securing the border is totally ridiculous if he doesnt understand that its his job to secure the border then he only shows how unfit he is to be president its funny how he didnt need a special bill passed by the republicans in order to demand that sections of the border wall built under trump torn down barbed wiring removed and resume ineffective catch release policies instead of just keeping trumps catch deport policy so why didnt joe biden need a bill signed by the republicans approving of these insane actions that pretty much created the border crisis weve been living under for the past 3 years oh how convenient,OTHER,OTHER
