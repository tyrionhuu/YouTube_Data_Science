## Twitter Stance Detection - A Subjectivity and Sentiment Polarity Inspired Two-Phase Approach

Treat polarity as classes, i.e. AGAINST, FAVOUR, and NEUTRAL.

### First-Phase

- **Weighted MPQA Subjectivity-Polarity Classification:** The tokens and the stemmed tokens, from the tweets, are measured against the MPQA subjectivity lexicon, with weights and polarities being taken into account. Each tweet has a cumulative sum of the scores, obtained as a sum of the individual tokens it comprises. The positive and negative polarity tweets are assigned positive and negative weights respectively. Tokens matching the strong subjective set are assigned a magnitude of 2, whereas the weak subjective words are assigned a magnitude of 1. Each tweet has a cumulative weight as the sum of the scores of its constituent tokens. We construct a pragmatic boolean feature where, Tweets with an overall positive sum beyond +2 or a negative sum below -2 are termed as subjectively inclined, whereas the intermediate values are marked otherwise.
- **Wordnet Based Potential Adjective Recognition:** Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe [13] show that different kinds of adjectives, such as dynamic adjectives, semantically oriented adjectives, and gradable adjectives are strong predictors of presence of subjectivity. Motivated by this, we aim to analyze the presence of such adjectives in a syntactically extended set. We extensively use Wordnet [26], to enable the construction of this syntactic feature, wherein, we aim to detect whether a token given in the tweet content, exists in Wordnet and is marked as an adjective there, and construct a boolean feature accordingly. Note that, words that at all can be used as an adjective (as per Wordnet), are used to form this feature, and not the actual usage of the word in text (which would be tagged by the PoS tagger). This is a novel feature in context of the problem at hand, and is syntactic in nature.

### Second-Phase

- **SentiWordNet and MPQA Based Sentiment Classification:** This pragmatic feature provides an overall positive or negative score to the sentence, to interpret the sentiment behind it. Using positive and negative word lists from SentiWordNet, tokens are assigned a polarity score of +1 or -1, for belonging to these lists respectively. The sum of every token is taken as the feature for classification. Further, MPQA subjectivity is also used, as an integer sum of the polarity score of all the tokens present in the tweet content.
- **Frame Semantics:** “Frame semantics assemble the meanings of different elements in a given piece of text to model the meaning of the whole text” [3]. In our setting, we use a primitive but effective approach for identifying the different elements of the text, namely, connector words. If a tweet (often akin to compound sentences in nature) comprises of connector tokens, such as but, although, also, therefore, then the two clauses it tends to combine have a varying impact on the semantics of the sentence as a whole. Connectors with the ’opposite’ feel, such as but and although, give more importance to the latter clause, while those with the ’apposite’ feel, give the first clause support by using an appropriate complimenting second clause. For small multi-sentence tweets, this applies across the sentence boundaries as well. We assign more weightage to the more important clause, in case connector words are present in the sentence. This is a novel feature in context of the problem at hand, and is semantic in nature.wise
- **Target Detection:** This is a boolean feature. The value of this feature is set to be true if the given target (as a whole) is present in the content of the tweet, and is set to false otherwise.
- **Word n-grams:** We construct a set of word n-gram features (lexical). These boolean features are used to mark the presence of word n-grams, holding true if any ngram present in the target string also belongs to the tweet content, and false otherwise. For instance, if both the target string as well as the tweet text contain the bigram “Hilary Clinton”, then the word bigram feature will be set to true. Specifically, we use unigrams, bigrams and trigrams.
- **Character n-grams: **Similar to word n-grams, we also construct a set of character n-gram (lexical) boolean features. These features are used to check the presence of character bigrams, trigrams and 4-grams, containing any character-token of the target string in the tweet. Note that, special characters and whitespaces are excluded while the character n-gram features are constructed.

## Summary

1. ALL the papers treat stance as categories, i.e. favor, against, neither. And it's not pratical to deduce a valid number to represent a s
