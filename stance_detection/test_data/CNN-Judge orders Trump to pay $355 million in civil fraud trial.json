Trump borrowed from the bank and exaggerated the measurements of the building. Also, by law, he should ask for an appeal. Our justice system is corrupt. NY should help Trump because he helped NY when the city was bankrupt. The judge should accept the appeal. It is normal business practice. By the law, it is called unusual punishment and Trump will be protected by the law. The same court system that the judge rule. God bless Truckers and Trump. Thank you for standing up against corrupted court justice. Investigate DA and Judge for not accepting an appeal. Justice for one is justice for all.  Let's go Brandon!",

The first thing that should be looked at is how did this judge arrive his values for Trump's properties?  I am willing to be anyone that the three approaches to value (Income, Cost & Market) were not completed. Furthermore I will also bet that a \"as of date of valuation\" was never assigned. For CNN viewers that means the date the court assigned the value, was it 2000, 2022 or what?  It must be specific dates as in 01/01/2022 or it's all worthless. Which it is anyway as the judge has ZERO real estate education, see his wiki page, you will also discover he is an old failure of a musician that fell back on the law for a living.",

Most businesses don't have a huge profit margin, maybe 20 percent is a good point for most. this trail points out that the common person would have to pay an additional 168 million (maybe more if you have less money the trump) in interest payments effectively eating away at the profit margin. So the extremely rich saves 168 million and can lower the cost of their widgets or use capitol in other ways to be more competitive while not affecting the profit margin. This means the extremely rich will most likely win in a competitive business every time. making the richest richer and keep the less rich in their place. Now Government (judge) is stepping in to help the billion dollar finance industry keep this borderline criminal process going. This should be the focus and the reason for outcry. Stop focusing on Trump and see how the rich get rich while the rich are left with scraps.",

The ignorant news caster claimed trump has to pay it back. There is nothing to pay back, nobody lost a dime, and he didnt inflate the value of his property. The judge just undervalued it.",

Are they demanding the money be paid to them?\n\n...\n\nAnd I'm not supposed to believe Trump when he says the deep state is conspiring against him?",

The nuclear reactor should have been close a long time ago. Because it spreads radiation to Europe and other continents. Radioactive and chemical wastes of the \u041c\u0435ts\u0430m\u043er Nuclear Power Plant enter the Caspian Sea through rivers and then into the oceans through other rivers. The NPP is located in a seismic country and a strong earthquake can occur at any time. Armenia should be sanctioned and embargoed to close this reactor. This environmental terrorism must be stopped. \u0422he number of cancer patients in the world is increasing rapidly due to nuclear power plants. The government of Armenia, which is a military-economic ally of the invading Russia \u0430nd receives financial and military support from it, should think about the health of the peoples of Europe. The Prime Minister of Japan said that the chemical and radioactive waste of nuclear power plants in Japan will be discharged into the ocean. As a result of water circulation and rainfall, plants will absorb toxic water. There will be radiation in drinking water and cancer patients will increase. Russia's political and military leadership is planning armed sabotage at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Mines are buried in the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from all sides. Explosives are placed inside the reactors. World leaders must stop this ecological disaster",

            "comment_text": "Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.\r\n\r\nEngoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.\r\n\r\nLegal experts say former President Donald Trump is likely to use a bond, secured with his assets as collateral, as the first step in satisfying the judgment in the New York civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron ordered Trump and his companies to pay nearly $355 million, which Trump has vowed to appeal.\r\n\r\nUnder a so-called appeal bond, Trump would put up a percentage of the judgment and a third-party company that is the guarantor \u201cis on the hook for the full amount,\u201d said Joshua Naftalis, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in New York.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to determine the full assets available to Trump, because his business is a privately held concern and does not regularly file reports with regulators. In a deposition taken last year as part of the case brought by James, the former president said his company had more than $400 million in available cash.\r\n\r\nAdam Leitman Bailey, a real estate attorney in New York, said Trump likely would have to put up 10% of the judgment in cash, plus an additional fee. \r\n\r\nIn January, a jury in a civil defamation case ordered Trump to pay $83.3 million to former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, on top of the $5 million verdict she had already won against him last year.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys argued during the trial that the attorney general\u2019s claims against Trump had no victims \u2014 the banks were paid back and were eager to do business with Trump.\r\n\r\nBut the attorney general argued, and the judge agreed, that the fraudulent loans Trump received at lower rates had an impact on the marketplace. Plus, the law used to bring the claims against Trump does not require there to be victims of fraud in a traditional sense.",

The bank ALWAYS gets the property appraised.  If it's business property, they allow for potential profit margins, when valuing your business.   As a black business man, I'm sorry, but this stinks to high heaven.  What's worse, is it's wasting everyone's time.  This case will never survive appeal, once it leaves NY state.

Supporting biden will lead to our conquest by china, north korea, and russia.  china has already tested their new hypersonic missile in flight nuclear attack strategy to see if they could control the direction the balloon travels over our airspace.  the next time we see chinese balloons flying over our air space, each one will be carrying a launch platform and three hypersonic missiles armed with nuclear warheads.  their balloons cannot be seen from space unless or until they launch a missile in flight.  the heat signature is easily detected from space.

A Judge who already said Trump was guilty before day one of court handed down an official verdict today, yeah I'm sure that's legit...  This is nothing more than politicians, a crocked Judge and an attorney trying to assure Trump is not re-elected with no witness', no evidence, nothing.   Thing is though, his support just keeps growing.  Even lifelong Dems can see the writing on the wall and are walking away from the party the more Dems throw things at the wall to see if they stick.   Trump will appeal and win with a real Judge who can't be bought by the Dems and we all know it.   And for the Pete's sake people, if you're going to comment on a story please understand what the story is and don't comment with made up lies just to throw dirt, that's just sad, and makes you look obtuse.",

Because as Scripture say. there be people left behind to face gods wraith and face the mark of the beast. were a person will have it on there right hand or forehead. so if you stay behind dont take the mark satay in faith to Jesus for this time will be hell on earth. lucifer will force you to take it. Do not accept it choose death. i pray you and many get saved and my fellow christians spread the word. Ephesians 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: and Romans 8:31-39 \n31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?\n32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\n33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.\n34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.\n35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\n36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.\n37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.\n38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,\n39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.",

On appeal, that one thing will kill this once  the appeals process leaves NY.   No bank or financial institution joined in on this.  I don&#39;t like the man either, but this is not good.  I live in another state, and it just looks like NY and DC are out to get this man.   As a black voter,  it&#39;s making me re think my 2020 vote, and I&#39;m not alone.  NY is giving Trump something money can&#39;t buy, street credit!    I hope you watch what happens to the polls over the next week, especially in the minority community.  Judging from your comment, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to like it.   Moreover,  I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be able to understand it.   If people wanted Trump gone, they should have left him alone after 2020.  No indictments, no coverage, nothing.  If that had happened, he wouldn&#39;t be much more than a footnote.  But no,  these prosecutors and media had to go and create a monster.<br>Well, he might be broke in November, but he&#39;ll have a salary of 500,000 a year for four years, paid for by you and me!",

He put his daughter-in-law, Laura Trump in as co-chair for the RNC who handles the funds. We know he uses campaign funds for his personal bills from the Stormy Daniels hush money scandal. \nDid he really think he was not going to draw attention to himself? Every middle class and under American citizen should be very offended by his words. \nHow anyone from the very beginning could not see through his bulshit is beyond me.\nI say this often because I believe it's relevant.... LBJ was president when I was born. We have never had such a classless person running our country.

He throws a bunch of money into poorly managed projects that can never reclaim the investment, so he offsets part of that by not paying the bills when they come due. Then he lies to insurance companies to keep that expense low, while also lying to tax authorities to keep that liability fraudulently low, all while then grossly inflating property values to lenders in order to get better terms, and to borrow against equity that does not exist. The way he kept all of the plates spinning was to keep churning more and new scams, using borrowed monies from one to keep making payments on the others until he could get a new scam up and running. Then add in the wonders of money laundering opportunities that his projects in Panama & Eastern Europe presented, to say nothing of the illegal enrichment from the Middle East & China while POTUS, and the millions just rolled in (just in the nick of time since he was already on the verge of going bust and being indicted just before resorting to a run for POTUS). He just ran out of time. And now, when forced to work under the law, with administrative compliance looking at everything, it presents a way of doing business that gump has literally never experienced. The simple fact is that he somehow managed to fail completely in the past, even with all of his illegal advantages and ignoring of the law, so the odds of him being able to do it all legally for the first time in his life, are less than zero.\nOh, and let's not forget that he's gotta cough up a half a billion dollars (so far) just as a starting point for this brand new world (to him & his). Watching them all fail again and again while we wait for them to go to jail is the payoff for having had to tolerate these scumbags being allowed to live among us all if these years. Can't wait to see them all die broke, exposed, and alone.  \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment_text": "\"A judge has ordered EX President Donald Trump and his companies to pay $355 million in a ruling in the New York civil fraud case. The former president is also barred from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years.\"\n\nLOL, ROTFLMAO!!!! so sweet, so GOOD!!! just keep piling on more and more stress and anger on this clown and maybe we'll be rid of him before November too!\n\nEx President Donald Trump and the Trump Organization must pay $354 million in fines, a judge ruled Friday, issuing his long-awaited judgment in the state's civil fraud case. The decision also bars them from seeking loans from financial institutions in New York for a period of three years, and includes a three-year ban on Trump serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron handed down his judgment in a 92-page decision on Friday. The ruling is one of the largest corporate sanctions in New York history.\n\nThe judge's decision also blocks Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and Jeffrey McConney, former corporate controller, from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years, and permanently bans them from serving in the \"financial control function\" of any New York corporation.\n\n\"The evidence is overwhelming that Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney cannot be entrusted with controlling the finances of any business,\" Engoron's order states.\n\nIn addition to imposing limits on Trump's business activities, the order bans his two oldest sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or legal entity for two years.\n\nThe two, who serve as executive vice presidents at the Trump Organization, must also pay more than $4 million apiece, including interest. Weisselberg is ordered to pay a $1 million penalty. \n\nEngoron issued a scathing rebuke of Trump, his two adult sons, Weisselberg and McConney in his decision, writing that they refused to admit error even after four years of investigation and litigation.\n\n\"Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,\" he wrote. \"They are accused only of inflating asset values to make more money. The documents prove this over and over again.\"\n\n\"If the Attorney General is permitted to retroactively insert herself into private commercial transactions between sophisticated parties, no business transaction entered into in the State of New York will be beyond the attorney general's purview,\" the spokesperson said. \"Every member of the New York business community, no matter the industry, should be gravely concerned with this gross overreach and brazen attempt by the attorney general to exert limitless power where no private or public harm has been established.\"\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James brought the civil suit in 2022, asked the judge to bar Trump from doing business in the state and sought a penalty of $250 million, a figure her office increased to $370 million by the end of the trial. Trump, the Trump Organization and several executives, including his two eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, were named as co-defendants in the suit.\n\nEven before Friday's ruling, the judge had largely affirmed James' allegations that Trump and others at his company inflated valuations of his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a decade, and misrepresented his wealth by billions. The scheme, the state said, was meant to trick banks and insurers into offering more favorable deal terms.\n\nEngoron ruled in September that Trump and the other defendants were liable for fraud, based on the evidence presented through pretrial filings.\n\nThe trial, which began in October and wrapped up in January, focused on other aspects of the lawsuit related to alleged falsification of business records, issuing false financial statements, insurance fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThe financial penalty James sought, known as disgorgement, is meant to claw back the amount Trump and his company benefited from the scheme. (Under New York law, disgorgement cases are decided by a judge, not a jury.) \n\n\nThe lawsuit laid out seven causes of actions \u2014 the claims of illegal conduct that James' office said entitled the state to claw back ill-gotten profits and warranted severe sanctions against the defendants:\n\n    Persistent and Repeated Fraud\n    Falsifying Business Records\n    Conspiracy to Falsify Business Records\n    Issuing False Financial Statements\n    Conspiracy to Falsify False Financial Statements\n    Insurance Fraud\n    Conspiracy to Commit Insurance Fraud\n\nThe claims revolve around financial statements given by Trump and his company to banks and insurers.  The statements were prepared by accounting firms using spreadsheets of underlying data that included vast inflations of Trump property valuations.\n\nThe defendants lost on the first claim, persistent and repeated fraud, before the trial even started.\nThe Sept. 26 fraud ruling\n\nEngoron agreed in September with James' office that it was beyond dispute, based on evidence presented through pretrial filings, that Trump and his company provided banks with financial statements that misrepresented his wealth by billions.\n\n\"The documents here clearly contain fraudulent valuations that defendants used in business,\" Engoron wrote in the Sept. 26 ruling.\n\nEngoron found as fact in that ruling that Trump and the company overstated the valuations of many properties by hundreds of millions of dollars. He cited the Palm Beach Assessor valuation of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club at between $18 million and $28 million for each year between 2011 and 2021 \u2014 the values for which he paid local property taxes. During those years, Trump valued the property at between $328 million and $714 million on his annual statements of financial conditions.\n\nIvanka Trump and her brothers said they couldn't recall many of the interactions at the center of the case, including deliberations related to efforts to secure financing and insurance for Trump property developments. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. both sought to pin blame on the company's accountants, claiming they had little involvement in the preparation of financial statements that misrepresented the values of company properties.\n\nBut Engoron determined that there was \"sufficient evidence\" that Eric and Donald Trump Jr. \"intentionally falsified business records.\" He found that Eric Trump \"intentionally\" gave McConney \"knowingly false and inflated valuations\" for the Seven Springs estate, a Trump-owned property in Westchester County, New York.\n\nThe former president took the stand on Nov. 6, stopping to address the media on his way into court. \"It's a very sad situation for our country,\" he said.\n\nUnder oath, he gave long-winded answers, seeming to test the judge's patience. At one point Engoron addressed Trump's lawyers, saying, \"We got another speech,\" and urging them to \"control him if you can.\"\n\nAs questioning continued, Trump defended the valuations of various Trump Organization properties said the company's statements of financial condition included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies.\n\nEngoron's order criticized Trump for failing to answer many questions, which the judge said damaged his credibility.\n\n\"Overall, Donald Trump rarely responded to the questions asked, and he frequently interjected long, irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial. His refusal to answer the questions directly, or in some cases, at all, severely compromised his credibility.\"\n\nIvanka Trump, the former president's daughter and once an executive at the Trump Organization, was originally named as a defendant in the suit, but an appellate court later dismissed allegations against her, citing the state's statute of limitations.\"",

Do you kool-aid drinkers have any idea what went on in this \"trial\"?  Donald Trump was given NO TRIAL at all.  He was simply declared guilty by this judge before he even showed up in the court room not given a chance to defend himself at all..  This hearing was simply to figure out the punishment. He was accused of a crime where there was NO victim,  nobody or lender was damaged in any way.  It was confirmed that every lender was paid back and made money.  So where is the crime then?  He was accused of over valuation of real estate.   Having borrowed money on real estate myself it just don't work that way.  The lenders always do their own appraisals and lend the money accordingly.  You can hate Donald Trump all you want, but he did absolutely nothing wrong.  This is just a bunch of haters that do what haters do, there is no Justice here, just hate.  I'll leave you with this, if they can get away with this farce on Donald Trump they can do anything they want to you.  This is a sad day for our legal system.",

Then he is able to go to the lingerie department , still no witness , which has no staff in a shop renowned for customer service . Then in a row of locked fitting rooms he just happens to find one unlocked . She would not even produce the dress she claimed she was wearing that day which should have provided , or not , DNA evidence for her . I&#39;m Sure she stated it was Donna Karen dress of a certain style which turned out to be a style that had not been made at that time. The case only went forward as it was financed by Reid Hoffman who is a very big democratic donor and they managed to get a clearly partisan judge . The actual jury did not even find him guilty of [R]ape as there was no evidence , it ended up as sexual battery which could be something as small as an unwanted kiss on the cheek , it was the judge after the trial that called him a [R]apist . There are more details but it is enough to describe her as a dangerous eccentric lunatic that calls her cat vagina and thinks [R]ape is sexy.<br>Trump was not the first she accused of this by the way",

They gag order him how many times because he was telling it exactly like it is, anyone without political bias can see he was going to be guilty before he walked in there. He has all the receipts for everything paid back every cent he owed, if your upset with someone start with the banks that offered the loans and assessed his assets? And as for  Mrs James I won\u2019t re type what her campaign was based on you can easily look it up, I mean today it\u2019s trump next time it\u2019s someone else they don\u2019t like bc of there political views hate trump all you want but this is bigger than him and will not stop our justice system is corrupt for political gain and if he hasn\u2019t shown that already then you just don\u2019t want to see the truth.. It\u2019s funny if I were him I would never touch NY again\u2026 I hope he moves all his business and tax revenue jobs everything out of there. He has shown nothing but love for that city and done so much for it, lol Alvin Bragg and Mrs James will right the ship though don\u2019t worry \ud83d\ude02",

Kindly get the word out that House speaker Republican Mike Johnson, a Trump puppet, is responsible for the death of 1000s of Ukrainian solders by holding up and not giving aid to the fledgling democracy in Ukraine .  The blood of these young Ukrainian solders, so many of them nice young men, is on the head Mike Johnson and Trump. Sleep well at night you two.\r\nRead on...\r\nThousands of young Ukrainian solders are dead around Avdiivka  because Mike Johnson  is seeking political leverage over Biden by withholding Ukrainian military support and now thousands of Ukrainian solders are dead because of him.  It is immoral for  Mike Johnson and Trump to back the murdering thug, dictator Putin by holding up Ukrainian support.  Also, don\u2019t worry about the money, they want to make you worry abou the money,   because know that Ukraine support only costs  6.5% of the yearly US military budget. Kindly check out the military cost part in your own searches.\r\n\r\nI am a Republican, or was,  and I am disgusted with the party leadership allowing this to happen to a fledgling democracy in Ukraine that only wants liberty and freedom and stay out from under the boot of the thug Putin.  I thought the US supported  democracies?  Ukraine is a sovereign nation attacked by Putin because he wants Ukrainian businesses, ports, to use Ukrainian agriculture as blackmail, and to force young Ukrainian men into his army and use them to attack the next country on his list. Putin has already tried and failed to use food/starvation blackmail tactic by blocking Ukrainian grain shipments to Africa\u2026which you can also check out on your own too.  Ukraine is the primary key to Putin's larger war plans and he needs to be stopped now.  Give the aid to Ukraine today, right now.\r\n\r\nAgain, the blood of these young Ukrainian solders is on Mike Johnson and Trump because they have held up support for polictical reasons which is immorial. \r\n\r\nGo Nikki. Vote for Nikki.  Sorry I had to get that in.",

This is all fraud.\n\nThe 3-year ban, basically is a life ban for Trump.  \n\nActually, Trump is getting off very light because some of these crimes are considered bank fraud crimes for filing false bank statements.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Department of Justice should have been the first agency to have filed charges for bank fraud, but because Merrick Garland is the current Attorney General, Trump is receiving deference that no other taxpayer would receive.\u00a0 This places Trump above the law.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt is very clear there are at least three or four Justice systems at play.\u00a0 One for the very rich, the powerful, white privilege, and another for minorities.",

            "comment_text": "Dear CNN News,\n\nPlease investigate the following concept very carefully:\n\nIf we interpret the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin as the retaliatory assassination of Alexey Navalny for the ruling issued by the judge against Donald Trump, this fundamentally requires an absolutely invasive, digitally and materially present instance of Espionage either within the inner circle of the judge, their courthouse, or the Trump Legal Team. The assassination happened immediately before the ruling and public knowledge of its contents details, but during its time of being typed, printed, and controlled dissemination, this meaning a Russian presence is somewhere within the 24 hours prior to these very moments of today. There is a Russian Spy operating either digitally or physically within the United States which has to be embedded within this New York civil fraud case.\n\nIf the Russian Spy is within the inner circle of the judge or the courthouse, the people who have access to computers and documents is limited, thus the presence should be easily detected if anybody realizes they need to go searching for it. If however, the Russian Spy is within contact to the Trump Legal Team, then we would have undeniable proof that Donald Trump is in contact with Vladimir Putin, the former United States President is an asset to the present Russian President, is by all obvious accounts a Traitor! The immediate arrest and isolation of Donald John Trump for treason is warranted, and his candidacy for a second term as President is forfeited. If this does not proceed immediately, then it is a conspiracy to allow it to continue on, if not for by as an intelligence operation, then as a systemic corruption to deny this egregious vulnerability of Western democracy, because if the Russian Spy is operating freely within the courthouse so as to meddle about, where else in association to Donald Trump are they operating in America? \n\nThere could be multiple locations and branches of governments and places of law that are technically compromised here?",

            "comment_text": "In the United States, civil fraud and criminal fraud are two distinct legal concepts that involve fraudulent activities but differ in terms of the nature of the proceedings, the parties involved, and the potential consequences. Civil Fraud: Nature: Civil fraud refers to fraudulent activities that harm individuals or entities, leading to financial losses or damages. Proceedings: Civil fraud cases are typically handled in civil court through lawsuits filed by the aggrieved party (plaintiff) against the alleged wrongdoer (defendant). Burden of Proof: The burden of proof in civil fraud cases is usually lower than in criminal cases. The plaintiff must establish the fraudulent activity by a preponderance of the evidence, showing that it is more likely than not that fraud occurred. Penalties: If the plaintiff prevails, the defendant may be required to compensate the plaintiff for damages or losses. In some cases, punitive damages may also be awarded to deter similar conduct in the future. Government Involvement: Civil fraud cases are generally brought by private individuals or entities. However, government agencies may also pursue civil fraud cases, especially in matters involving fraud against the government. Criminal Fraud: Nature: Criminal fraud involves fraudulent activities that violate criminal laws, and the focus is on punishing the wrongdoer for criminal conduct. Proceedings: Criminal fraud cases are prosecuted by government authorities in criminal court. The government (prosecution) brings charges against the defendant, who is accused of committing a crime. Burden of Proof: The prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a higher standard than the preponderance of the evidence used in civil cases. Penalties: If convicted, the defendant may face criminal penalties, including fines, probation, restitution, and imprisonment. The severity of the penalties depends on the specific criminal statutes involved and the circumstances of the fraud. Government Involvement: Criminal fraud cases are initiated and prosecuted by government authorities, such as federal or state prosecutors. Individuals who commit criminal fraud may face charges brought by agencies like the FBI, SEC, or other law enforcement entities. In summary, civil fraud involves private legal actions seeking compensation for damages, while criminal fraud involves government-initiated prosecutions seeking to punish individuals for violating criminal laws. The burden of proof, penalties, and the parties involved differ between civil and criminal fraud cases.",
