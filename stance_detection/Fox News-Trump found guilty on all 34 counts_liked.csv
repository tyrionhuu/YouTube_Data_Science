donald trump is not a republican a real republican would not have tried to overthrow the government that he vowed to protect when he became president and you know that is true this is how a real and respectful republican should and did leave the office of president in his farewell address to the nation ronald reagan said we must always remember that our strength lies in our respect for the constitution and the bill of rights and our determination to preserve it for our children and their children,46
2 impeachments a criminal conviction what a disgrace,29
he did it to himself,7
if they applied this much scrutiny to every politician at least 80 of washington would be behind bars for 10 years,6
34 convictions and that doesnt include january 6th on that day alone he committed at least 10 crimes,6
i prefer presidents who dont have 34 criminal convictions felon,5
this whole situation is crazy because trump also broke 34 rules created by the supreme court for more information on the topic look up trump rule 34,4
dont do the crime if you cant do the time,4
this is great verdict big applause for the jury for seeing that he is a criminal i always knew bruce wayne had shady dealings and finally they came to light no more buying weird offshore materials now on to lex luthor,4
news flash orange rapist convicted of 34 minor felonies with many more serious charges pending in florida georgia and dc maga cult headquarters quotes lucille ball saying waaaaaaaaaaaa,3
not surprised he was found guilty he is guilty,3
amazing how everything is rigged only when trump loses,3
is trump still under that stupid gag order even though the trial is over or can he say whatever he wants now cuz i hope he can speak freely now like everybody else,3
lock him up lock him up lock him up,3

im overdosing on this man i cant quite get back to that first high when this was live but its close,2
hey trumpsters so much winning,2
i came here to gloat but everyone beat me to it lol nice to see were not so divided after all,2
if i was found guilty of 34 felonies no matter what they were i would go to prison trump is not above the law,2
trump refuses to accept reality this is not news,2
this stupid witch hunt is ridiculous this will not stop him from becoming president 2024 donald trump will make america great again,2
checkmate you cant obtain a security clearance if you are a convicted felon the potus must have a security clearance nice little move this was got the job done trump can run he can win but he cannot take office,2

maga you have made trump your god god says to put no other god before him this was your warning,2
trump qnd his followers cant stop crying what happened to the once great republican party orange stained,2
paytriot give your money to a campaign if you want to fools haha its all a fake stage show they are laughing all the way to the bank im keeping my hard earned useless paper fiat,2
all major republican and democratic political strategists know that the only candidate likely to beat biden in the presidential election was nikkey haley except unfortunately the majority of republican supporters trump cannot win the presidential elections,2
make america great again put trump in prison,2
34 guilty convictions trump the felon,2
lock this felon up,2
when i saw many deluded trump cultists reacting to the verdict i am reminded of a quote when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross this is the best example that no one is above the law it emphasizes that all citizens and institutions including lawmakers and leaders are accountable to the same laws and this concept ensures that no individual or group can act with impunity regardless of their standing or authority and yes this actually applies to donald j trump sadly this is something that these cultists will never acknowledge or understand,2
crazy how even after trumps presidency liberals cant stop thinking about him trying to put him in jail throw shade on his name im not trumps biggest fan did i vote for him yes but because he was the better option at the time but its really sad considering there is so many crimes liberal politicians have committed and should have gone through the same court processes as trump funny that liberals only seem to want law and order when it fits in with their political agenda people need to start standing up or its just gonna keep getting worse,2
is all this winning rigged as well magas guilty on all counts,2
this clown thinks that he could use his infantile theatrics and distractions to convince everyone that he is not a thief liar con artist racist and a pu33y grabbing clown moron that does not like a bathe and smell like spoil cheese,2
this is a fantastic verdict of 340 now lock up this criminal,2
dump the effing gop trash fox is as corrupt as the cult,2
michael cohen got jail time for nonviolent crimes trump organization accountant got jail time for nonviolent crimes if trump doesnt get jail time it just proves that our criminal justice system is trash no one should be above the law,2
even if trump is found guilty you will never see him in jail i bet a million dollars jails are for poor people and rich people is above the law simple,2
trump lawyers will go down as the worst lawyers in history,2
this is how you make america great again,2
trump said im fighting for our constitution in his posttrial speech its the same constitution he said should be terminated can you say hypocrite,2
every time a jury of ordinary citizens have been asked to look at the evidence against trump they have unanimously returned an indictment against him or a guilty verdict the only ones ignoring trump criminal behavior is the ԙpubliʞaи cult i say again its always unanamous,2
trump is not running for president he is running away from jail the most incredible thing in the us today is a cult that wants a convicted felon as its dictator believe trump when he says he wants to be a dictator,2
maga tears on the horizon,2
trump and magalooooooosers,2
our country is absolutely doomed not because of this verdict though this verdict was great our country is doomed because its full of easily manipulated low iq cult followers that will worship a man despite any evidence thats presented to them its just so sad,2
good this is real news not fake news,2
trump 2024 years in prison,2
in other news hunter is caught butt naked and free not quilts,2
things arent looking good for the orange man cult,2
wow you dummys keep sending him money,1

melania divorce,1
lock him up lock him up lock him up,1
so much winning lol,1
biden just got tough on crime and conservatives are not havin it,1
lock him up,1
trump storm the courthouse,1
obviously a fake trial to cripple his ability to run again since every poll says he will beat biden,1
hahaha bring a trump follower means two things 1 dumb 2 cult member,1
how do you say first time offender with 34 felony convictions any other taxpaying us citizen would spend a decade in prison at least no trump wont see a second in jail because the system is not for our lords they are for the commoners,1
but biden cant even talk or protect our country lets immigrants pour in by the thousands he took showers with his daughter and has touched kids on camera he needs to be put to sleep and the evil man walks free and no charges bidens son does cocaine in his bathroom and the list goes on and on but of course that idiot got into office and has done nothing for americans god always wins and i pray biden gets whats coming to him until then good people suffer like always,1
there many that pray to the lord for you president trump,1
cant believe this happened in a great country united statesthis will not be a great country againhow this person juan merchan become a judge if there is no justice in his mindif there is no justice for trump then there is no justice for anybody those people who hold the notes says lock him upif they can lock him up then next time you will be the next one to be locked up by a judge without justice in his mind,1
he was used he played the game within a plan to ruin humanity and is no longer needed simple,1
everyone who watched the trial knows it was completely unfair trump was deprived of many rights and everyone knows that new yorks judicial system is among the most flawed and crookedc systems in the country in any case he will not be sentenced to jail time if the judge has any integrity whatsoever even if he is sentenced to jail his sentence will likely be stayed until the appeal is completed and it is likely to be overturned on appeal no matter how you look at it this trial is an american disgrace alvin bragg is a puppet and a slimey spineless bottomfeeder,1
justice thank you lord,1
im not falling for this garbage im still voting for trump the democrats will do anything to throw this election im not surprised about the new york kangaroo court,1
i did hard time we need prison reform,1
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha,1
this will boomerang in a big way im seeing so many people walking away from the democratic party right now,1
while ny judiciary makes the nation proud the sdny and main justicedoj still stinks 1 why didnt they pursue trump individual1 after he left office in jan 2021 2 why didnt doj pursue obstruction of justice charges recommended by mueller after jan 2021 3 why did they waste 125 years before starting to investigate trump and appoint a special counsel,1
us is making history a former president is adjudicated by a court as sexual assaulter in 248 years a president or former is criminally indicted for the first time in 248 years a former president is found guilty of felony in 248 years tbd a convicted criminal felon is going to be a presidential candidate,1
juror 2 gets his news from truth social yet there was an unanimous conviction imagine how strong the evidence is,1
now we can officially say criminal convict trump and criminal felon trump neither youtube nor the video publisher can remove it,1
finally wins a popular vote unanimous win,1
this is the most corrupted court case in the history they didnt fined any crime they prosecute him and they decide his guilty for crime that didnt exist this is we against,1
bwaaah haha haa lock him up,1
he finally won a vote,1
trump 2024,1
i love maga tears let it rain,1
ha so much for throw her in jail throw him in jail 34,1
not hearing any boooos from the crowd he sure has a collection of titles now convicted rapist and convicted felon oh and twice impeached lets not forget that one you seriously think this criminal should be running the country 999 of you wouldnt invite a rapist and felon to dinner at your homes but they are still qualified to be the president,1
its so funny how the comments trump makes about his trial are indistinguishable from the comments alex jones made during and after his trial,1
they didnt raid bidens house because biden let them search anywhere they wanted trump had 9 months to hand over the files and had his minions hide them duh you must think fox veiwers are morons,1
trump will be 47th president in november,1
couldnt happen to a better traitor,1
can the judge lose job for this miscarriage of justice,1
american justice has become a comedy show,1
trumps lawyers and the prosecution in common agreement chose 12 jurors the jurors took a closer look at the evidence more than you or me or anybody and it takes only one juror disagreeing on guilt to trigger the not guilty verdict how can anybody say that it was rigged,1
rigged its a witchhunt etc lol,1
if he never ran for presidency again this never wouldve even happened,1
the sexualy liable abuser wife cheater tax evader draft dodger twice impeached four times indicted demented covicted sore loser is fully qualified to be the banana republican 2024 candidate,1
trump 2024,1
we the people pardon trump,1
hes gonna be 47,1
absolutely nobody makes excuses like a trump supporter,1
ya gotta love it liar and con man crooked trump convicted on 34 felony counts hope he gets life in prison without parole thank you jurors,1
only psychopaths with little to no conscience support donald trump the bible said in the latter times men will have their conscience seared with a hot iron,1
do all you people gloating know that hillary clinton was found by the fec guilty of the exact same crimes she was found guilty by a federal agency of illicitly using campaign funds to fund the steele dossier the document that started the entire russia collusion hoax this is fact it in the official records now its not fox news disinformation do you know that she was found guilty by them for hiding the payments as legal fees by falsifying her records do you know that all she got was a slap on the wrist an 8000 fine click on a new tab and search hillary clinton campaign finance fine and read one of the articles available on left leaning new sites and learn for yourself just be honest and tell us you are perfectly fine with half of your fellow americans living under a different set of rules laws and consequences spare us you trying to argue the facts,1
anything that is in favour of crown trump he will thump up anything that is against him he will scream and shout on top of his voice this is political persecution political motivated or peoples who do the right thing against him are scums hence how would he be statesman where he does not obey the rule of law is he a man of jungle as he believes the law of jungle his mother was right who voted for crown trump he is either a gullible or a moron,1
truly interesting how many comments show how woke many still are,1
why anyone would think this rogue judge and his handpicked jurors would have come up with any other verdict is ridiculous note in ny only 4 jurors need to vote guilty on each count out of 12 jurors that is anything no not unanimous nor is it considered unanimous in other states such a dog and pony exhibition and msm shut their mouths about biden authorization of muntions force from us in russia,1
trump maga 2024 we will not back down we want justice,1
guilty as charged,1
ill still vote for trump even if he goes to jail it beats having biden,1
good morning usa i got a feeling that its gonna be a wonderful day,1
trump 2024 between 20and24 years in prision,1
heh hehhehehehahahahahaha,1
in addition to being convicted on all counts as a person of color orange theres a strong possibility that hell be given a maximum sentence,1
34 for 45,1
trump is guilty its not hard to make that assertion if you pay attention to what is actually said and done in the court room except people cant seem to abstract politics and their hatred for the other team long enough to think clearly rationally and objectively anymore i am no democrat dont really support biden and that has zero to do with the fact that trump was guilty he just does the same old song and dance every time blame every one and every thing else but himlike a child no matter how much this guy claims things are rigged evidence evidence evidence simple,1
im so glad they found him guilty he needs to realize nobody is above the law he doesnt care about us or america its all about him jail i hope,1
america gets to choose between a hair smelling ice cream eating dimensia suffering old man and a narcissistic felon is that the best that usa has to offer,1
and dont forget president trump will win november 5th 2024 and those real criminals that committed real crimes with overwhelming evidence will finally pay if this country is yet turned upside down,1
republicans need to start thinking about a plan to replace trump as the nominee before the rnc convention instead of engaging in stupid and futile protests outside the nyc courthouse,1
ll,1
cry republicans,1
convicted felon donald trump he couldnt even get a job a many fast food places with his criminal record,1
crybabies all in the comments,1
3434 convicted felon rofl,1
hahahahahahahahahahaha,1
so let me see if i get this straight i have to pass a background check to be a cashier at stop and shop yet a convicted felon gets to run for president of our country can somebody make sense of this because i sure the hell cant,1
well there you go a precedent has been set to go after former presidents if no one is above the law doors open for retro prosecution to include a few representatives senators judgesand the list goes on i think our forefathers are rolling over in their graves truth has been hijacked and ill also bet if you look up at the statue of liberty she is weeping the only thing this solves is dividing us even further divide and conquer,1
i seriously dont think he should be convicted of 34 felonies when all he did was send hush money to stormy daniels to say that she didnt sleep with him i think its sabotage so he cant run as president,1
ha ha,1
people can protest peacefully all they want but that wont change the verdict and thank god we dont have a justice system based upon personal opinion,1
lock him up be careful fox you dont want to have to pay another seven hundred million dollar fine for knowingly spreading lies,1
the real verdict is going to be on november 5 if i win of course otherwise its rigged again,1
lol this presenter reading off the guilty verdicts sounds like she is at an auction haha,1
god is good,1
remember donaldtwelve minded people found you guilty of all charges face up to the fact that sensible people get the right verdict your supporters have yet to find their brains and morality,1
narsisist never accepts defeatneverwhat a loser,1
can you say kangaroo,1
only donald trump will get convicted with 34 cases and some being felonies and not going to prison thats wild people drive and get a dui and jail time for a misdemeanor,1
shame trial,1
hahahahahahahahahahahaha,1

he needs to be removed from the presidential candidacy,1
trump 2025,1
the russians putin compromised trump years ago and supported 200 trumps bid to become president they weaponized the fbi and judicial system all because putin wanted to invade the ukraine without nato response trump sold out american democracy system to make a buck those who support him are either stupid corrupt themselves of delusional,1
lol good orange buffoon,1
how you like that bye bastard,1
lock him up,1
god is good this the lord work,1
now if we could just get rid of fox news for spreading lies 247 we will be on our way to unifying the country that they have divided,1
if the republican party had any brains and wanted to go back to true conservatism they would have a new candidate by monday i cant stand donald trump or joe biden i would vote for a moderate conservative over joe biden in a heartbeat no more sociopath con man we dont need a trump want to be,1
cant fix stipid sell them a red hat show them fox news done,1
all you liberals better watch yo mouth you gonna be crying when hes president again and can actually form a sentence unlike the president we have now,1
guilty guilty guilty,1
any updates on those clintonobama indictments yet,1
for any of us a key factor in our sentencing would be how well we conducted ourselves in the eyes of the judge during the trial,1
finally accountability for the orange clown criminal,1
whoevers cheering are dumb if they think that weaponize government is a good thing they should be afraid we are becoming a third world country,1
trump 2024,1
integrity first service before self excellence in all we do loyalty duty respect selfless service honor integrity courage commitment these are samples of the core values across our military branches of which i was proud to serve in now sit there and tell this vet how you thank us for our service while you support a man who embodies none of these values character matters we must demand at least as much from our president and ourselves as we do from our armed forces,1
if being prosecuted for crimes is election interference maybe he shouldnt have committed all those crimes,1
accountability,1
no one wanted to prosecute this case because well there was no crime to prosecute so biden realizing that voters are aware that he biden is destroying the country sent for bragg and ordered him to charge trump with something anything a democrat donor judge was picked and a democrat jury to insure evidence would be berried and of course trumps found guilty july 11th trump will be sentenced to 134 years in prison and biden will be reelected see mail in ballots no id needed good plan to usher in fascism,1
yea total bullsht none of this amounts to sht phoney charges trumped up politically driven court of nonsense to interfere with an election if this keeps up the people are gonna lose their patience with the process and the people running it and then you will get a real insurection with real violence from a really angry populace,1
trump is innocent trump represents the majority of the american and australian people let america and australia great again biden and his adult diapers are not fit to be reelected the deep love from aussie for the president trump,1
just makes me a bigger trump fan will work harder to get him back where he belongs,1
ill still vote for trump even if he isnt on the ballot socialism is taking over this country it must be stopped,1
of course the cesspool of humanity found him guilty,1
im still voting for trump the first guilty president because america is guilty biden is guilty,1
democracy 1 maga 0,1
lock him up,1
theyll all be reversed obviously,1
law and order,1
republicans gotta move on from this clown,1
the former republican president of the united states has been found guilty of 34 felonies and fox only post a 2 min 36 sec clip of it if this was biden it would be hours and hours long,1
don the coneligible for prison now please make this happen,1
im honestly not surprised they jury knew how this would end before openings,1
republicans dont want felons voting for president just running for president,1
do not expect the courts especially the supreme court to provide justice we must vote blue and remove the corrupt ԙpubliʞaи party from all offices vote blue,1
trump you lost the popular vote by 22 in 2016 and by 48 in 2024 you will lose by double digits in 2024 your bots show you ahead in the polls but bots dont vote,1
trump is a convicted criminal found guilty on all 34 counts all unanimous that says a lot,1
you can have the rule of law or you can have trump the dictator but you cannot have both vote blue,1
777skeptic obama is not a criminal which would you prefer blue suit prison cell or tan suit clean record and right to vote,1
once again all jury deliberation involving trump are always unanamous verdicts or indictments by ordinary people,1
nikki haley,1
justice,1
justice wins i hope the americans can draw the right conclusions from this conviction i come from germany and without the war of the allies we would have received a military dictatorship like in north korea i am grateful for that please dont break your great country,1
hes innocent trump 2024 appeal,1
im surprised it took this long,1
biden still wont get reelected trump 2024 this will all be overturned by appeal because this was rigged from the judge to the jury,1
fasten your seatbelts trumplican traitors it is going to be a bumpy night and there are three more trials to go,1
