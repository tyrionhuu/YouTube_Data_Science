Roosevelt came to this chamber to speak to the nation and he said I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union Hitler was on the March War was raging in Europe President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time freedom and democracy were under assault in the world tonight I come to this same chamber to address the nation now it's we who face unprecedented moment in the history of the union and yes my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been underall at home as they are today what makes our moment rare is that freedom of democracy are under attack at both at home and overseas at the very same time overseas Putin of Russia is on the March invading Ukraine and sewing chaos throughout Europe and Beyond if anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop a Ukraine I assure you he will not but Ukraine Ukraine can stop Putin Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that needs to defend itself [Music] that is all that is all Ukraine is asking they're not asking for American soldiers in fact there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine and I'm determined to keep it that way but now assistance Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership wasn't long ago when a Republican president named Ronald Reagan thundered Mr gorbachov tear down this wall now now my predecessor a former Republican president tells Putin quote do whatever the hell you want that's a quote a former president actually said said that bowing down to a Russian leader I think it's outrageous it's dangerous and it's unacceptable America is a founding member of NATO the military allines of democratic nations created after World War II prevent to prevent war and keep the peace and today we've made NATO stronger than ever welcome Finland to the alliance last year and just this morning Sweden officially joined and their minister is here tonight stand up welcome welcome welcome welcome and they know how to fight Mr Prime Minister welcome to Nato the strongest military Alliance the world has ever seen I say this to Congress we have to stand up to Putin send me a bipartisan National Security Bill history is literally watching history is watching the United States walks away it will put Ukraine at risk Europe is at risk the Free World at risk and Bolding others to do what they wish to do us harm my message to President Putin who I've known for a long time is simple we will not walk away we will not bow down I Will Not Bow Down in a literal sense history is watching history is watching just like history watched three years ago on January 6th when Insurrection storm this very capital and place the diger the throat of American democracy many of you are here on that darkest of days we all saw with our own eyes the insurrectionists were not Patriots they' come to stop the peaceful transfer of power to over Stern the will of the people January 6 lies about the 2020 election and the plots that steal the election posed a great gravest threat to US democracy since a civil war but they failed America stood America stood strong and democracy y prevailed we must be honest the threat to democracy must be defended my predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th I will not do that this is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies here's the simple truth you can't love your country only when you win as I've done ever since being elected to office I ask all of you without regard to party to join together and defend democracy remember your oath of offic to defend against all threats foreign and domestic respect respect free and fair elections restore trust in our our institutions and make clear political violence has absolutely no place no place in America zero place again it's not it's not hyperbole to suggest history is watching we're watching your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do history is watching another assault on Freedom join us so light is Lor Beasley a social worker from Birmingham Alabama 14 months ago 14 months ago she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF she scheduled treatments to have that second child but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state Unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning roie Wade she was told her dream would have to wait what her family had got through should never have happened unless Congress act it could happen again so tonight let's stand up for families like hers to my friends across the aisle don't keep this waiting any longer guarantee the right to ABF guarantee a nationwide like most Americans I believe row we got it right I thank vice president Harris for being incredible leader defending reproductive freedom and so much more thank you my predecessor came to office determined to see roie Wade overturned he's the reason was overturned and he brags about it look at the chaos that has resulted joining us tonight is Kate Cox the wife and mother from Dallas she's become pregnant again and had a fetus of a fatal condition her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have F children in the future were at risk if she didn't act because Texas law banned her ability to act Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get what she needed what her family got through should have never happened as well but it's happened happening and too many others there are state laws Banning the freedom to choose criminalizing doctors forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states to get the treatment they need many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive Freedom my God what Freedom else would you take away look it's a decision to overturn Ro v Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote The Following and with all due respect justices women are not without elector electoral power excuse me electoral or political power you're about to realize just how much you about clearly clearly those bragging about overturning Roy weight have no clue about the power of women but they found out when reproductive Freedom was on the ballot we won in 2022 and 2020 and we win again in 2024 if you if you the American people send me a Congress that supports the right to choose I promise you I'll restore roie Wade as the law of the land [Music] again folks America cannot go back I'm here to tonight to show what I believe the way forward because I know how far we come four years ago next week before I came to office the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in the century remember the fear record losses remember the spikes and crime and the murder raging virus that took more than 1 million American lives of loved ones Millions left behind a mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness a president my predecessor failed the most basic presidential Duty that he owes to American people people the duty to care I think that's unforgivable I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the nation's history we have it doesn't make new but news in a thousand cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never [Music] told so let's tell the story here Tell It Here and Now America's comeback is building the future of American possibilities building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down investing in all America in all Americans to make every sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one no one behind the pandemic no longer controls Our Lives the vaccine that saved us from Co are now being used to beat cancer turning setback into comeback that's that's what America does that's what America [Music] does folks my inherited economy is on the brink now our economy is literally the Envy of the world 15 million new jobs in just three years a record a record unemployment at 50-year loads record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is a literal Act of Hope with historic job growth and small business growth for black and Hispanics and asian-americans 800,000 new manufacturing jobs in America and County where is it written we can't be the manufacturing capital in the world we are and we will more people have health insurance today more people have held in chur today than ever before the racial wealth Gap is as small as it's been in 20 years wages keep going up inflation keeps coming down inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% the lowest in the world and tending lower the landing isn't will be soft and now instead of importing importing foreign product and exporting American jobs we're exporting American products and creating American jobs right here in America where they belong and it takes time but the American people are beginning to feel it consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring buy America has been the law of the land since the 1930s past administrations including including my predecessor including some Democrats as well in the past failed to buy American not anymore on my watch Federal projects that you fund like helping build American roads Bridges and highways will be made with American products and built by American workers creating good paying American jobs and thanks to our chips and science act the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before during the pandemic a shortage of semiconductors chips that drove up the price of everything from cell phones to Automobiles and by the way we invented those chips right here in America well instead of having to import them instead of we private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America creating tens of thousands of jobs many of those jobs paying $100,000 a year and don't require a college degree in fact my policies have attracted $650 billion in private sector investment in clean energy Advanced manufacturing creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America and thanks and thanks to our bipartisan infrastructure law 46,000 new projects have announced all across your communities and by the way I noticed some of you strongly voted against it are they cheering on that money coming in I like it I'm with you I'm with you if any of you don't want want that money in your District just let me know modernize our roads and bridges ports and airports public transit systems removing po poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risking brain damage providing affordable affordable high-speed internet for every American no matter where you live Urban Suburban or rural communities in red States and blue States record investments in tribal communities because of my investment in a Family Farms because I invested in Family Farms led by my sector of Agriculture knows more about this than anybody I know we're better able to stay in the family for the those farms for and their children and grandchildren won't have to leave leave home to make a live in it's transformative the great comeback story is Bader Illinois home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years before I came to office the plant was on its way to shutting down thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods Hope was fading then I was elected to office and we raised the beler repeatedly with auto companies knowing Unions would make all the difference the UAW worked like hell to keep the plan open and get these jobs back and together we succeeded instead of Auto Factory shutting down Auto factories reopening the new state-ofthe-art battery is being built to power those cars there at the same folks the folks of Bel I say instead of your town being left behind your community is moving forward again because inste of watching allo JB jobs of the future go overseas 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building the future in Bader right here in America here tonight is UAW president Shan Fain a great friend and a great labor leader Sean where are you stand up and and Dawn and Dawn sim a third generation worker UAW worker at Bader Sean I was proud to be the first president to stand in the picket line and today dawn has a good job in her hometown providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well showing once again Wall Street didn't build America they're not bad guys they didn't build it though the middle class built the country and unions built the middle class I say to the American people when America gets knocked down we get back up we keep going that's America that's you the American people it's because of you America is coming back it's because of you our future is brighter it's because of you that tonight we can proudly say the state of our Union is strong and getting stronger tonight tonight I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together a future where the days of trickle down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get to all the tax breaks and by the way I understand corporations I come from a state that has more corporations invested than every one of your states in the state United States combined and I represented for 36 years I'm not an anti-corporation but I grew up in a home where trickle down economics didn't put much on my Dad's kitchen table that's why I determined to turn things around so middle class does well when they do well the poor of a way up and the wealthy still do very well we all do well and there's more to do to make sure you're feeling the benefits of all we're doing Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world it's wrong and I'm ending it with a law that I propos and sign not one of you Republican buddies work voted for it we finally beat big Pharma instead of paying $400 a month or thereabouts for insulin with diabetes and it only cost 10 bucks to make they only get paid 35 a month now and still make a healthy profit and I want to but what to do next I want to cap the cost of insul $35 a month for every American in Egypt everyone for years people have talked about it but finally we got it done gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs just like the VA is able to do for veterans that's not just saving seniors money it's saving taxpayers money we cut the federal deficit by $160 billion because Medicare you'll no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big farmer this year Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market to treat everything from heart disease to arthritis it's now time to go than give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade they're making a lot of money guys and they'll still be extremely profitable will not only save lives it will save taxpayers another $200 billion starting next year the same law caps total prescription drug cost for seniors on Medicare at2 200 $2,000 a year even for expensive Cancer drugs that cost 10 12 $15,000 I want a cap prescription drug cost of $2,000 a year for everyone folks I'm going to get in trouble for saying that but any you want to get in Air Force woman and fly to Toronto Berlin Moscow I mean excuse me and well even Moscow probably and bring your prescription with you and I promise you I'll get it for you for 40% the cost you're paying now same company same drug same place folks the Affordable Care Act the old Obamacare it's still a very big deal over 100 million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of pre-existing condition but my predecessor and many in this chamber want to take prescription drug Away by repealing Affordable Care Act I'm not going to let that happen we stopped you 50 times before and we'll stop you again in fact I'm not only protecting it I'm expanding it the we the enacted tax credits of $800 per person per year reduce healthc care costs for millions of working families that tax credit expires next year I want to make that savings [Music] permanent to State the obvious women are more than half our population but research on women's health has always been underfunded that's why we're launching the first ever White House initiative on women's health research led by Jill doing an incredible job as first [Music] lady to pass my plan for $12 billion to transfer women's health research and benefit millions of lives all across America I know the cost of housing is so important to you if inflation keeps coming down mortgage rates will come down as well and the FED acknowledges that but I'm not waiting I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgages when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space just for 2 years and my Administration is also eliminating Title Insurance on federally backed mortgages when you refinance your home you can save $11,000 or more as a consequence for millions of renters we're cracking down on big landlords who use antitrust law using anti who break antitrust laws by price fixing and driving up rents we've cut red tape so Builders can get federally financing which is already helping build a record 1.7 million new house housing units Nationwide now pass now pass and build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring those wrents [Music] down to remain the strongest economy in the world we need to have the best education system in the world and I like I suspect all of you want to give a child every child a good start by providing access to preschool for three and four years old you know I think I pointed out last year I think I pointed out last year that children coming from broken homes where there's no books and not read to not spoken to very often start school kindergarten or first grade hearing having heard a million fewer words spoken well study show the children who go to preschool are nearly 50% more likely to finish High School go on to earn a two and four year degree no matter what their background [Music] is I met a year and a half ago with the leaders of the business Round Table they were mad that I they were angry I well they were disgusing why I wanted to spend money on education I pointed out to them as vice president I met with over eight I think it was 182 of those folks don't hold me the exact number and uh I asked them what they need most the CEOs and you've had the same experience to both sides Al they say a better educated Workforce right so I looked at them and I say I come from Delaware the Pont used to be the eighth largest corporation in the world and every new Enterprise they bought they educated the workforce to that Enterprise but none of you do that anymore why are you angry with me providing you the opportunity for the best educated Workforce in the world they all looked at me and said I think you're right I want to expand highquality tutoring and summer learning to see that every child learns to read by third grade [Music] I'm also connecting local businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience in a path to good paying job whether or not they go to college and I want to make sure the college is more affordable let's continue increasing the pel grants to working in Middle Class families and increased record investments in HBCU and minority serving institutions including Panic institution when I was told I couldn't universally just change the way in which we did dealt with student loans I fixed two student loan programs that already existed to reduce the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans including nurses firefighters and others in public [Music] service like Keenan Jones the public educ from Minnesota who's here with us tonight Keenan where are you Kenan thank you he's educated hundreds of students so they can go to college now he's able to help after Deb forgiveness get his own daughter to college and folks look such relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home start a business start a family while we're at it I want to give Public School teachers a [Music] raise by the way the first couple years we cut the deficit now let me speak to the question of fundamental fairness for all Americans I've been delivering Real Results in fiscally responsible ways we've already cut the federal deficit we've already cut the federal def of over a trillion dollars I signed the bipartisan deal to cut another trillion dollars in next decade it's my goal to cut the federal def another three trillion by making big corporations very wealthy finally beginning to pay their fair share look I'm a capitalist you want a make or can make a million or millions of bucks that's great just pay your fair share in taxes a fair tax code is how we invest things to make this country great healthc care education defense and so much more but here's the deal the last Administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefit the top him 1% the very wealthy and the biggest corporation and exploded the federal deficit they added more to the national debt than any presidential term in American history check the numbers Folks at home does anybody really think the tax code is fair do you really think the wealth in big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break I sure don't I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair under my plan nobody earning less than $400,000 year will pay additional penny in federal taxes nobody not one penny and they haven't yet in fact the child tax credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half restore that child PX edit no child should go hungry in this country the way to make the tax code fair is to make big corporations the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share remember in 2020 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in federal income tax zero not anymore thanks to the law I wrote when we signed big companies have to to pay a minimum 15% but that's still less than working people paying federal taxes it's time to raise corporate minimum tax to at least 21% so every big Corporation finally begins to pay their fair share I also want to end tax breaks for big farmer Big Oil private checks massive executive pay when it's only supposed to a million a million dollars it could be deducted it they can pay 20 million if they want but deduct a million end it now you know there are 1,000 billionaires in America you know what the average federal tax is for those billionaires no they're making great sacrifices 88.2% that's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay no billionaire should pay a lower federal tax rate than a teacher a sanitation worker or a nurse I propose a minimum tax for billionaires of 25% just 25% you know what that would raise that would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years and imagine what that could do for America imagine a future with affordable child care millions of can get they need to go to work to help grow the economy imagine a future with paid Le because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of their thick family member imagine imagine the future of Home Care and elder care and people living with disabilities so they can stay in their homes and family caregivers can finally get the pay they deserve tonight let's all agree once again to stand up for seniors many of my friends on the other side of I want to put Social Security on The Chopping Block if anyone here tries to cut Social Security Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop you the working people the working people will built this country pay more into Social Security than Millionaires and billionaires do it's not fair we have two ways to go Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy I will that's the proposal oh no you guys don't want another $2 trillion tax cut I kind of thought that's what your plan was well that's good to hear you're not going to cut another $2 trillion for the super wealth that's good to hear I'll protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share look too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits charging more and more for less and less that's why we're cracking down on corporations engage in price gouging and deceptive pricing from food to healthc care to housing in fact the snack companies think you won't notice if they change the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer same same siiz bag put fewer chips in it no I'm not joking it's called shrink flation pass Bobby Casey's Bill and stop this I really mean it you probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars you get you get charge the same amount and you got about I don't know 10% fewer Snickers in it look I'm also getting rid of junk fees those hidden fees at the end of your bill that are there without your knowledge my Administration announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to [Music] $8 Banks and credit card companies are allowed to charge what would cost them to in to instigate the the collection and that's more a hell of a lot like $8 and3 some dollars they don't like it credit card companies don't like it but I'm saving American families $2 billion a year with all the junk fees I'm eliminated Folks at home that's why the banks are so mad it's $20 billion in profit I'm not stopping there my Administration proposed rules to make cable travel utilities online ticket sellers tell you the total price up front so there're no surprises it matters it matters and so does this in November my team began serious negotiation with a bipartisan group of senators the result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen oh you don't think so oh you don't like that bill huh that conservatives got together and said it was a good bill I'll be darn that's amazing that bipartisan would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers 100 more immigration judges helped tackle the backload of 2 million cases 4,300 more Asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of six years now what are you against 100 more Hightech drug detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop Vehicles smuggling fentanyl into America that's killing thousands of children this bill would save lives and the Order of the Border it also give me and any new president new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the Border when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming the border of Patrol Union has endorsed this bill the federal Chamber of Commerce is yeah yeah you're saying L look at the facts I know I know you know how to read I believe that giving the opportunity for a majority in the House and Senate would endorse the bill as well a majority right now but unfortunately politics has derailed this bill so far I'm told my predecessor called members of Congress and the Senate to demand they block the bill he feels political WI he viewed as a be a political win for me and a political loser for him it's not about him it's not about me I'd be a winner not really [Applause] I Lincoln Lincoln Riley an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal that's right but how many thousands of people being killed by legals to her parents I say my heart goes out to you having lost children myself I understand but look if we change the dynamic at the border people pay people people pay these Smugglers 8,000 bucks to get across the border because they know if they get by if they get by and let into the country it's 6 to 8 years before they have a hearing and it's worth taking the chance of the $8,000 but but if it's only six month 6 weeks the idea is is highly unlikely the people will pay that money and come all that way knowing that they'll be able to be kicked out quickly folks I would respectfully say to suggest my friend my Republican friends owe it to the American people get this bill done we need to act now and if my predecessor is watching instead of paying politics and pressuring members of Congress to block the bill join me in telling the Congress to pass it we can do it together but that's what he apparently hears what he will not do I will not demonize immigrants saying they are poison and the blood of our country I will not separate [Music] families I will not ban people because of their faith unlike my predecessor on my first day in office I introduced the comprehensive Bill to fix our immigration system take a look at it as all these and more secure the Border provide a pathway to cisti for dreamers and so much more but unlike my predecessor I know who we are as Americans we're the only nation in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new home to Native Americans his ancestors have been here for thousands of years home to people of every place from every place on Earth they came freely some came in Chains some came when famine struck like my ancestral family in Ireland some to flee persecution to chase dreams that are impossible Anywhere But Here in America that's America and we all come from somewhere but we're all Americans but folks we have a simple choice we can fight about fixing the Border or we can fix it I'm ready to fix it send me the to bill now a transformational his moment in history happened 58 59 years ago today in Selma Alabama hundreds of foot soldiers from Justice marched across the Edmund Pettis Bridge named after the Grand Dragon of the clucas clan to claim their fundamental right to vote they were beaten they were blooded and left for dead our late friend and former colleague John Lewis was on that March we miss him but joining us [Music] tonight our other marches both in the gallery and on the floor including Betty May Fikes known as the voice of Selma the daughter of gospel singers and preachers she sang songs of prayer and protest on that Bloody Sunday to help shake the nation's conscience five months later the Voting Rights Act passed and was signing the law thank you thank you thank you thank you but 59 years later their forces taking us back in time voter suppression election subversion unlimited dark money extreme Jerry mannering John Lewis is a great friend to many of us here but if you truly want to honor him and all the heroes of March with him then then it's time to do more than talk pass the freedom to vote act the John Lewis voting right now and stop stop denying another core value of America our diversity across American Life Banning books it's wrong instead of erasing history Let's Make History I want to protect fundamental rights pass the equality act am I message of transgender American I have your back pass the pro act for workers rights raise the federal minimum wage because every worker has a right to a decent living more than a seven bucks an hour we're also making history by confronting the climate crisis not denying it I don't think any of you think there's no longer climate crisis at least I hope you don't I'm taking the most significant action ever on climate in the history of the world I'm cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030 creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs like the ibw work is building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations conserving 30% of America's lands and Waters by 2030 and taking action on environmental justice fence line Community smothered by the legacy of pollution and pattern after the Peace Corp and America Corp I launched the climate Corp to put 20,000 young people to work in the for for front of our Clean Energy Future I'll triple that number in a decade to State the obvious all Americans deserve the freedom to be safe and America is safer today than when I took office year before I took office murder rates went up 30% 30% they went up [Music] the biggest increase in history it was then through no through my American Rescue plan which every American voted against I mad at we made the largest investment in public safety ever last year the murder rate saw the sest decrease in history violent crime fell to one of its lowest levels of more than 50 years but we have more to do we have to help cities invest in more community police officers more mental health workers more Community violence and inven give communities the tool to crack down on gun crime retail crime and car jacking keep building trust as they been doing by taking executive action on police reform and calling for it to be the law of the land directing my cabinet to review the federal classification of marijuana expunging thousands of convictions for the mere possession because no one should be jailed for simply using or have it on their record take on crimes of domestic violence I'm ramping up the Federal enforcement of the violence against women act that I proudly wrote when I was a Senator so we can finally finally end the scourge against women in America there other kinds of violence I want to stop with us tonight is Jasmine whose nine-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers in elementary school in Uvaldi Texas very soon after that happened Jill and I went to Uvaldi for a couple days we spent hours and hours with each of the families we heard their message so everyone in this room in this chamber could hear the same message the constant refrain and I was there for hours meeting with every family they said do something do something well I did do something by establishing the first ever office of gun violence prevention in the White House that the vice president is leading a charge thank you for doing [Music] it meanwhile Meanwhile my predecessor told the NRA he's proud he did nothing on guns when he was president after another shooting in Iowa recently he said when asked what to do about it he said just get over it there is his quote just get over it I say stop it stop it stop it stop [Music] it I'm proud we beat the NRA when I signed most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years because of this Congress we now must beat the NRA again I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazine pass Universal background checks none of this none of this I taught the Second Amendment for 12 years none of this violates the Second Amendment or vilify responsible gun owners you know as we managed challenges at home we're also managing crisis abroad including in the Middle East I know the last five months have been gut-wrenching for so many people for the Israeli people for the Palestinian people and so many here in America this Crisis began on October 7th with a massacre by a terrorist group called Hamas as you all know 1,200 innocent people women and girls men and boys slaughtered after enduring sexual violence the deadliest day of the for the Jewish people since the Holocaust and 250 hostages taken here in this chamber tonight our families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring every one of your loved ones home we [Music] also [Music] we will also work around the clock to bring home Evan and Paul Americans being unjustly detained by the Russians and others around the world Israel has the right to go after Hamas Hamas ended this conflict by releasing hostages laying down arms could end it by by releasing the hostages laying down arms and surrendering those responsible for October 7th but Israel has a excuse me Israel has a added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population like cowards under hospitals daycare centers and all the like Israel also has a fundamental responsibility though to protect innocent civilians in Gaza this war has taken a greater toll in innocent vilians than all previous Wars in Gaza combined more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed most of whom are not Hamas thousands and thousands of Innocents women and children girls and boys also orphaned nearly 2 million more Palestinians under bombard bment or displacement homes destroyed neighborhoods and Rubble cities in ruin families without food water medicine it's heartbreaking I've been working non-stop to establish an immediate ceasefire that would last for 6 weeks to get all the prisoners released all the hostage released to get the hostages home and ease the Intolerable and humanitarian crisis and build toward an enduring a more something more enduring the United States have been leading International eff to get more humanitarian assistance of Gaza tonight I'm directing the US military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food water medicine and temporary shelters no us boots will be on the ground a temporary Pier will enable a massive increase the amount of humanitarian assistance getting in Gaza every day [Music] and Israel must do its part Israel must allow more Aid in The God Who ensure humanitarian workers aren't caught in the crossfire and they're announcing they're going to they're going to C have a Crossing in Northern Gaza so the leadership of Israelites say this humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority as we look to the Future the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over [Music] time and I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel my entire career no one has a stronger record with Israel than I do I challenge any of you here I'm the only American president of is Israel in Wartime but there is no other path that guarantees Israel's security and democracy there's no other path that guarantees Palestinian can live in peace with PO with peace and dignity there's no other path that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its neighbors including Saudi Arabia with whom I'm talking creating stability in the Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran that's why I build a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea I've ordered strikes to degrade thethy capability and defend US forces in the region as commander and chief I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military [Music] personnel for years I've heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise and America is falling behind they've got it backwards I've been saying it for over four years even when I wasn't president America is rising we have the best economy in the world and since I've come to office our GTP is up our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade and we're standing up against China's unfair economic practices we're standing up for PE peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits I revitalized our partnership and Alliance in the Pacific India Australia Japan South Korea Pacific Islands I've made sure that the most advanced American Technologies can't be used in China not allowing to trade them there frankly for all this tough talk on China it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that I want competition with China not conflict and we're in a stronger position to win the conflict of the 21st century against China than anyone else for that matter than any time as well here at home I've signed over 400 bipartisan bills but there's more to pass my Unity agenda strengthen penalties on fentanyl trafficking you don't want to do that huh pass bipartisan propery leg say to protect our children online harness harness the promise of AI to protect us from par ban AI voice impersonations and more and keep our truly sacred obligation to train and equip those we send into the Harm's Way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't that's why the song support and help of Dennis the VA I signed the PCT act one of the most significant laws ever helping millions of veterans exposed the toxin who now are battling more than 100 different cancers many of them don't come home but we owe them and their families support we owe it to our ourselves to keep supporting our new health research agency called RP and remind us remind us that we can do big things like end cancer as we know it and we [Music] will let me close with this yay I know you don't want to hear any more Lindsay but I got to say a few more things I know it may not look like it but I've been around a while when you get to be my age certain things become clearer than ever I know the American story again and again I've seen the contest between competing forces and the battle for the soul of our nation between those who want to pull America back to the past those who want to move America into the future my lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy a future based on core values that defined America honesty decency dignity equality to respect everyone to give everyone a fair shop to give hate no Safe Harbor now other people my age see it differently the American story of resentment revenge and retribution that's not me I was born in midwar War II when America stood for the freedom of the world I grew up in scran Pennsylvania in Claymont Delaware among workingclass people who built this country I watched in horror as two of my heroes like many of you did Dr King and Bobby CNY were assassinated and their legacy inspired me to pursue a a career in serice I left the law firm became a public defender because my city of Wilmington was the only city in America occupied by the National Guard after Dr King was assassinated because of the riots and I became a county councilman almost by accident I got elected to the United States Senate when I had no intention of running at age 29 then vice president of our first black president now president to the first women vice president in my career I've been told I was too young by the way they didn't let me on the Senate elevators for votes sometimes not a joke and I've been told I'm too old whether young or old I've always been known I've always known what endures I've known our North Star the very idea of America is that we're all created equal and deserves to be treated equally throughout our lives we've never fully lived up to that idea but we've never walked away from it either and I won't walk away from it now I'm optimistic I really am I'm optimist n my fellow Americans the issue facing our nation isn't how old we are it's how old are our ideas hate anger Revenge retribution are the oldest of ideas but you can't lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back you lead America the land of possibilities you need a vision for the future and what can and should be done tonight you've heard mine I see a future where defending democracy you don't diminish it I see a future will restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms not take them away I see a future for the middle class has finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes I see a future for we saved the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence above all I see a future for all Americans I see a country for all Americans and I will always be president for all Americans because I believe in America I believe in you the American people you're the reason we've never been more optimistic about our future than I am now so let's build the future together let's remember who we are we are the United States of America and there is nothing nothing beyond our capacity when we act together God bless you all and may God protect our troops thank you thank you thank you w [Applause] [Applause] hey Bobby I didn't

Seems to me that the working class and, the slave class did most of the work, with help from the middle class \u2013 and also help from rich investors. \"Venture capitalists\" including Wall Street people, all contributed to building the US. But at least Joe made some attempt to bring us together, rather than attempted to make us fear and hate each other. By the way I'm saying this as someone who has been a member of most, if not all, of these \"classes\" of people \u2013 a factory worker, an artisan (proprietor of piano service business, tuning, adjusting, and repairing pianos), and who, having retired, has even made a living by as a capitalist, investing successfully in corporations. I've known and been friends with many people from all these \"classes\" of people. The United States, unlike some other countries,  is a place where one can move from one \"class\" to another, or become part of more than one class at a time, and where we people *can work together* with one another rather than fear one another \u2013 the thing that Donald encourages us to do.",

Abbey Gate is the entrance to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan where a 2021 suicide bombing killed 170 civilians and 13 U.S. service members including Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui.  Both Mr. Nilotic and his wife both blame Biden and his utterly careless and rushed Afghanistan withdrawal for their sons death. \n\nThis man has sacrificed his son and now has been arrested for heckling this dolt of a president. Biden\u2019s actions are utterly disgusting. He deserves the contempt of every service man, every member of their family, and every American who supports the US Military.",

Almost 50 years later, on June 24, 2022, Roe v. Wade was overturned. Only four months after the overturn, coincidentally, on November 8, 2022, midterm elections were to took place and the dems needed a strong political tool to push with hopes of turning the midterm elections to their favor. \n\nIn the recent State of the Union, Biden says that if you vote for him, he\u2019ll restore Roe v. Wade. Hmmm\u2026 why hasn\u2019t he tried to restore it since it was first overturned almost 2 years ago? Could it be that the dems not only wanted to use the Roe v. Wade overturn for the 2022 midterm elections, but for the coming presidential election as well? Would it be a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d, aka an obvious probability, that the dems cooked up the Roe v. Wade overturn in the first place?\n\nConsidering this, what else could the dems have had a big part in cooking up\u2026 a certain deadly virus? \u2026 a staged \u201cinsurrection\u201d, all in the name of trying to win an election at any cost? After all, as they say, \u201cnever let a good crisis go to waste\u201d, especially if you are the ones who cause the crisis in the first place so you can use it to your advantage.",

That makes you a very very strong person regardless of age. There are some things that have happened that I've been critical of the President on or to where I thought more could be done, tho I do think he'd agree on that..more has to be done. We've done a lot and made it through a lot as a country. I wouldn't care if I was in a minority that actually likes the President or if I am, he's what a President is supposed to be. Especially in this day and age. I was moved in this speech in ways I didn't expect. So much has happened to our country but we're a beautiful nation with amazing people no matter what has happened or the challenges to come.

The very next law they created was the 11th amendment. That law being an amendment is suspicious where amendments are to right serious wrongs. Holding officials accountable is not a serious wrong, that the 11th amendment grants sovereign immunity to protect corrupt officials as a constitutionally protected right that trumps (npi) all other bills of rights. When I learned about this, I was blown away, and really, the amendment cultivated corruption way better than any organized crime syndicate. &quot;nobody is above the law?&quot; Why is there an 11th amendment then.

Trump would NOT abandon NATO and unlike Biden,Trump did not start wars, was very supportive of our military. Biden abandonded weapons to the Taliban\" our partners in the field\" he gave Iran 10 billion, Hamas 100 million and buys oil from Iran and Russia, FUNDING attacks on our soldiers. Biden is AMERICA LAST, no matter what he says, look at his actions. Biden has laws on the books to control the border,but refuses to. Biden almist killed rhe economy,is dragging us into WWIII.

Social Security System needs a roadmap too.  Altogether taken, Biden was great because he did great for his term, no one with the right mind can deny Biden's achievements.  Greene was more like an annoying fly that was ignored.  Delivery was great because he was mostly respected, he deserved it, there were moments where he had to repeat the two words that got switched, but essentially easily forgotten by those who noticed as I.  In a general sense, it was a powerful speech.  No country did better than any of Biden's achievements.\n\nThe government needs to award more scholarships that are merit based on arts and sciences, not just sports-oriented scholarships.  Since there's a wide gap between the haves and have-nots when it comes to tuition, the rich who could very well afford tuition for even 3 or 4 others should subsidize a scholar, 1 to 1.  The rich have too much from decades of enjoying favorable regulation from the government, they should subsidize other scholars.",

I am not saying being a hispanic Republican or even a MAGA automatically makes some one a murderer. I just can't help to notice most Republicans in the White community have a double standard when it comes to dealing with people of color. Men of color outside of thier party are vilified while men of color in the G.O.P. can get a pass for breaking the law just like a lot of rich white men in thier party. The way I see it the double standards are really more about politics than race. I don't rich is worse at this point.",

            "comment_text": "I am not commenting looking for an argument. Just sharing my opinion and exercising my right to free speech (while I still have it). This speech was nothing but half truths (which are essentially lies) and empty promises. Inflation is up well over 3%, by my personal observations grocery prices have increased between 25-40% and my housing cost 80%, just in the last couple years. I am aware that the \"stimulus\" approved in 2020 was under Trumps leadership which is part of why I am not looking to argue. Every where we look in big cities we see more and more tent cities popping up. This tells me that more and more people simply cannot afford to live. Our economy is not the best it has ever been. This isn't even a half truth, it is a bold faced lie. As for his claim that more companies are opening American based factories this is a twisted half truth. Look at GM, they are closing most of their plants located in Erie, PA, and thousands of hardworking people are being laid-off. Yes, they are opening new plants in El Paso, TX (where there are no unions and pay can be decreased). It would also be my assumption that it will not be Americans gaining employment there either. Open your eyes people. Watch independent news sources and CHECK THE FACTS yourself, as everything comes with a bias. I would STRONGLY encourage everyone to stop allowing so much division. Whether you are \"left\" or \"right\" leaning, you are still picking an apple from the same tree. Ultimately, we are want the same things. What is best for our country and our families. We need to find a way to be united and realize that those in power, whether right or left, do not have our best interests in mind or at heart.",

I take two insulins, two mental health meds and one pain med\u2026 over $4000 a month! I have to pay a small percentage but I\u2019m on disability and don\u2019t get much, less than $1,100 a month to barely survive.\nWhen I had cancer it was one of the worst things I had been through. Between that cancer and going through the pandemic at the same time it was nearly impossible to get safe transportation. Seeing first hand how little people were cleaning their vehicles between passengers, leaving folks exposed to that virus. People who were already health compromised were being put in jeopardy. If we can\u2019t be human enough to care for other people are we really fair to our own families? \nI ended up with covid twice during the time I was fighting cancer. Trust me it wasn\u2019t fun. Missing medal appointments because I couldn\u2019t leave my home just set back my treatment and my health. Being disabled also complicated this.\nI want a healthcare that is affordable, accessible, and For the people!",

To tell us you put forth legislation to stop the border crisis is the biggest lie.  You put forth an Ukraine aid package the Republicans rejected rightly so.  You tried to blame Republicans at every turn when all you have to do is follow the law of the US and let the border patrol do their job.  Nothing more than that.  Get out of the way of the border patrol and let them do their job.  But no you tied their hands and then wonder why Governors have to do your job and secure our borders.  Also your attempt at influencing this election process by going after Trump for some of the things you yourself did is outrageous.  Colluding with DA\u2019s in Georgia and New York to go after your political opponent is reprehensible.  I hope you are tried for your ill gotten gains along with your son.",

They don't give all the details. Oh and don't pay your dues and watch what happens to you. These unions do not care about you.. they only care about their pockets and you paying them dues.  \nNot to mention a lot of the costumers of these factories, will return to their home country. \n\nHonda is one of them. Honda has already said that if our company goes unionized they will move their factories back overseas and be done.\n\nUAW president is a friend of his, what a shocker. I am him pushing factories to unionize has nothing to do with the fact they are friends. I am sure he won't get his pockets lined.. *Insert eye rolls*",

In 1969, Bill Ayers, a militant organizer, along with wife Bernardine Dohrn co-founded the far-left militant organization &quot;Weather Underground&quot;. Dohrn was on the FBI&#39;s 10 Most Wanted list for several years. The Weather Underground was a radical left militant organization responsible for bombings of the United States Capitol, the Pentagon, and several police stations in New York. During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, a controversy arose over Ayers working with then &quot;Democrat&quot; candidate Barack Obama&#39;s election campaign. The Leftist &quot;May 19th Communist Organization&quot; and members of the &quot;Black Liberation Army&quot; engaged in domestic terrorism from 1978 to 1985. The organization carried out two prison escapes, several armed robberies, the killing of three armored car guards, and at least seven bombings. On Nov 6, 1983, two members of the group assembled a bomb in a restroom at the Capitol which detonated, causing extensive damage to the Capital. On Dec 6, 1990, Laura Whitehorn and Linda Evans were sentenced to long prison terms. &quot;Democrat&quot; President Bill Clinton commuted their sentences.",

The amendment made it where the sitting congress decided the next group of representative&#39;s  salaries. That amendment is actually good and kept them in check. Also, I am aware that the Constitution CAN be ratified, but no it shouldn&#39;t be for an abortion bill. The constitution is meant to defend fundamental and civil rights, not to fit political agendas. The pickyness of the amendments allowed to pass is what makes the constitution so strong. We don&#39;t need to change that for something (in the grand scheme of things) so insignificant like abortion. To be clear, I don&#39;t think we should add an amendment to ban abortion either. I think allowing the states to control themselves on this issue is a great compromise that both parties should agree on. They wont but they should",

I have to wonder why he&#39;s so anti-woman as to make that deplorable assumption and why he views women so negatively.  As a single mother, I&#39;d like to have a word or two with him because I filled my home with books.  My daughter was reading at THREE.  That&#39;s three years old - not third grade.  A goal of reading by third grade is just awful, a horribly low expectation because he thinks we moms cannot teach our children to read or something. Rather  a low opinion of women.

The fate of a nation has already been decided, but it still thinks it\u2019s in charge.\n\n And no, it\u2019s not terrorists you claim that are responsible for the demise of US, but those who makes decisions on behalf of the US that caused it to be so.\n\nThink about it, and realize my opinion is not wrong.",

Polls show the border is voters number one concern. \nSuddenly Democrats agree there is a crisis at the southern border but insist it\u2019s Trump\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the Republicans fault and the sheep fall for it. \n\nBiden says crime is down. Meanwhile, New York put the  National Guard in the Subway because crime is out of control. Stores leaving cities because of crime. \n\nBiden says the economy is great, wages are up. Meanwhile Americans are struggling to pay their bills and feed their families. Americans have record credit card debt. Record homelessness. \n\nBiden says he created record amount of jobs\u2026.lol. The jobs added are people going back to work after COVID. They are not new jobs. Now people are working two or three jobs to try to make ends meet. \n\nCan anyone other than criminal and illegal immigrants say they are better off today under Biden than they were before Covid?",

I surely hope that the people with questions re,,: DT listened to this important case made by the man who is doing the job.  There is NO contest here that Donnie & his Maga followers can win .  When you look at the record of Trump in his 4 years....there is NO comparison.  Joe Biden may be older, but he certainly isn't compromised when it comes to intelligence, wisdom, compassion & real caring about this country.  He works very hard to deliver on all issues facing us today & there is no one better to do the job than President Biden.  Save our country from the demonic traitor known as DT.

I am a well paid employee yet can\u2019t save any money since you came because everything is 30% more expensive. Just briefly tell us what we\u2019re your achievements in three years. What is the benefit for america to have you as president?! Nothing. You have been busy making and funding wars all over the world .All good for your party business of course but not benefits for the American people. You never talk about healthcare, schooling, prices non of your talk interests the American people on their daily lives . Go be a president of Ukraine . Even Israel doesn\u2019t respect of listen to America anymore because of you. You said it right if you were smart go home .",

For that matter, why isn&#39;t chamber length deducted from a rifle&#39;s measurement? The bullet doesn&#39;t start from the breech face.<br>There are two parties interested in barrel length.<br>The manufacturers and consumers in one camp and the regulators in another.<br>I was considering the BATFE method of measuring barrels. Their concern isn&#39;t ballistics, but conceal-ability.<br>One can simply drop a dowel down the barrel of an unloaded firearm, from the muzzle end until it contacts the closed bolt/slide. Measure that length of the dowel and you will have the barrel length.<br>This usually includes the chamber.<br>The revolver is measured the same way if it has revolving barrels like a pepperbox.<br>I assumed the BATFE would be consistant and rational in including the chamber as a part of barrel length as the cylinder length affects conceal-ability. Silly me. That&#39;s too rational.<br>If the revolver has a cylinder separate from the barrel, the cylinder is not included in the measurement.<br> Anyway have fun a be glad this chat is not about private parts!",

I dont believe our nation should constantly be divided into 2 parties, RFK Jr himself stated multiple times he looks to reform our political system making it easier for 3rd party/independent candidates to make a bigger impact on an election. Not to mention, he also looks to reform the way big companies interact with political campaigns, making it harder for them to impact the general election.",

In reality, Joe Biden needs no so-called Border Bill to act. As President of the United States he directly controls the Border Patrol, ICE and other elements of border security. He can order his Border Agents to do things to prevent many of the border crossings from happening in the first place and sign an Executive Order calling for the immediate deportation of the rest. Border security is a fundamental part of the President's job in his service to the country. That's what he's tasked to do. The  notion that he needs a bill passed before he can do his job of securing the border is totally ridiculous!!! If he doesn't understand that it's his job to secure the border then he only shows how unfit he is to be President! It's funny how he didn't need a \"special bill\" passed by the Republicans in order to demand that sections of the border wall, built under Trump, torn down, barbed wiring removed and resume ineffective catch & release policies instead of just keeping Trump's catch & deport policy. So why didn't Joe Biden need a bill signed by the Republicans approving of these insane actions that pretty much created the Border crisis we've been living under for the past 3 years? - Oh how convenient!!!",

More and More Americans are feeling the squeeze of regulations that cost us all money and benefit the privileged few. cost for education has soared while the quality of that education has fallen. \n\nsmall businesses are closing at rapid rates leading some communities no choice but to turn more and more to big business that pays little and has workers that are still on assistance programs, that cost the tax payer thus subsidizing the company low pay with tax dollars. \n\nwanna make politicians accountable, set their pay to the median of the state they come from, get rid of their lifetime health care, get rid of their ability to receive donations and freeze their investments while in office. remove their and their immediate families ability to interact in stock investments while in office. \n\nwanna make the wealthy pay their fair share with the tax codes? switch to a 10% purchase tax on all goods and services and get rid of the IRS that way those that buy more will pay more. \n\nthe border... that problem will end when we start hard deportations without exception, but we are not doing that we are spending them all out in the country an we are seeing the results in Chicago and New York, and all over the country, governors are asking people if they want to volunteer to help by opening their homes to illegals to help with the burden on the taxpayer yet shifting the burden directly to the taxpayer. yet housing illegals is supposedly illegal and working them is also illegal supposedly. \n\nall of these problems are actually our fault, the people of this great country, as we are the ones who elect all of these politicians. we have not stood up for ourselves. but we have let politicians run ramshables across the country. the failures of the country rest on our shoulders.",

It is time to clean house and do what is right! For unions this reflection will be in much higher pay rates and cleaning house of those who would continue to be careless with their members, for the owners of companies much the same those who float unreasonable rates of pay even pay that needs to tap national salaries for their payroll obligations...and so much more!  If they do this the commoners can  afford to honor the creator by giving them something to be thankful for ...The ability to build a brighter future...For the survivors of the struggle, we shall inevitably face ...This is the price of this repentance! The benefits are also just as tangible! Living well and pleasing the creator and owner of all the universe has many benefits! Subdue the earth and all that is in it and on it! Those nations that are in compliance need to continue, those nations who do not compliance is required! The USA among them it is time to clean the house before it burns down...We can build from scratch and count casualties of sloppy living but change is required! As for safety and security it is for every citizen bottom to top ...In fact slighting the classes brings you tons of insecurity and for gosh sake stop the lying ...abut what real living wages are if you work skilled jobs then you should be able to finance a home near where you work not hours away because of old cheaper houses and remote cities ...so saving are accrued but traded for commuting costs and time...",

But ultimately his administration pushed ahead with a plan to withdraw by Aug. 31, despite obvious signs that the Taliban wasn\u2019t complying with the agreement and had a stated goal to create an \u201cIslamic government\u201d in Afghanistan after the U.S. left, even if it meant it had to \u201ccontinue our war to achieve our goal.\u201d",

Since we have a progressive tax rate and have many tax credits and the standard tax deduction and earned income tax credit and child tax credits etc many working class folks end up paying very little federal income taxes or sometimes nothing at all. Now billionaires would be the 1% of 1% of 1% or something like that and yes we most find ways to get at that money through corporate tax rates and income tax rates but we need to figure out other ways to tax them because most of there \ud83d\udcb0 is not considered income for legal purposes. Just to be clear I 100% support raising taxes on high earners and mega high earners in order to pay for more social safety net programs but I believe it&#39;s important for us to be mindful that high earners are the top contributors to are Treasury. Now when it comes to social security that&#39;s a different story because of the tax cap (which we need to remove) the working class pays the bulk of the funding for that great program. And also working class folks that are single and have no kids do not get near the help and support that workers with families get and we need to have more tax credits for childless low to mid range adult income earners.",

Originally, the tax was for the church, orphans, relatives, transportation, wayfarers/small businesses. Also, widows, which is nowadays social security. Religious leaders now have non for profit etc. orphans like poor families falls under the department of family services, ie can get food cards etc.  then you have public schools so everyone can get an education. So the government has stepped in to provide services for poor family members: community centers, homeless shelters, etc. public transportation is inexpensive cause we pay the difference collectively and poor people, elders, and veterans can get free bus cards. Poor people probably shop at dollar stores, cause sometimes supporting vendors is expensive. So anyway, yes, everyone still should pay the same .20\u00a2 on the dollar, poor people usually get it back. If you are a billionaire, if you pay the same .20\u00a2, you probably won&#39;t get it back. But if you can afford to support other charities, those of course should be deducted. Also, businesses should get other breaks, because, they are providing the jobs that all classes of people work. They shouldn&#39;t be penalized because they provide jobs or because they make huge profits that they earn or deserve. So if you make 10K, you donate/forcibly taxed 2K, of course, you&#39;ll probably get it back. If you make 100K, you give 20K, you may not get it back, that&#39;s why upper middle class people get upset, because this, their hard earned money will often go to help someone making 10K, to make up for the 20K unearned by a poor person. But of course, 80K should be enough to live on. So if you make 1mil, it&#39;s 200K. So everyone has an issue, but at the end of the day. We all benefit from good spiritual guidance, helping orphans, helping poor relatives who aren&#39;t making enough money as their sibling, public transportation when you can&#39;t afford a car, small businesses. Of course, mothers or fathers who have lost child support because of a dead co-parent. Everyone wants a discount, so you either, go back to school, have less children or work more.

The longer the speech, the greater the number of people who tune out and don&#39;t hear the stuff closer to the end.  That may be particularly true of &quot;swing voters&quot;, as those represent a population of people who aren&#39;t as politically committed.

Keep in mind that elections are performed in the United States through a democratic process known as voting. Maybe you\u2019ve done it before. A republic and a democracy are not mutually exclusive; the United States has implementations of both systems. We are a \u201cFederal Constitutional Republic\u201d that democratically elects our representative officials. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that we didn\u2019t directly vote for senators. That actually used to be up to the State legislatures (respective to the senate seat at hand, for example Delaware state legislature would vote on the election of Delaware senators but had no authority to elect a Massachusetts senator). This was how our system worked until the passing of the 17th Amendment. The framers had in mind a wide system of hugely indirect democracy, and as our country evolved, more direct democratic reforms have since taken place. <br><br>Here\u2019s the definition for republic:<br><br>Republic (noun): \u201cA state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch.\u201d",

An Era long gone. It&#39;s hasn&#39;t worked in decades, and it never will again until the tax system is constructed fairly.  Inflation is through the roof because of corporate greed, veiled monopolies, and lack of regulation. DON&#39;T ask me, do your own research, this information is easy to find. CEO compensation is  at record highs, and the price of goods is unreasonably high. It&#39;s time to regulate. Nothing good comes from pushing wealth inequality. The working class becomes poor. They live paycheck to paycheck and are left with no money to put back into the economy aside from the food they buy. There is no money left for the &quot;opportunity&quot; to build their own wealth. The idea that &quot;the role of wealthy is to deploy their capital&quot; is very Nobel, but that idea DIED DECADES AGO. The role of today&#39;s wealthy is to buy another mansion and buy another yacht, make sure it&#39;s bigger than Charlie&#39;s. We are among the richest countries in the world, yet we have homeless hungry children. We have a growing crisis of mentally ill homelessness. Our quality of life, on average sucks. Health care, housing, education, transportation, all broken or crumbling systems. America is only the greatest country on earth, when it ensures that all its people are strong and ready for whatever comes our way. You can&#39;t build a strong, ready society when MORE than half the people are drained and disillusioned just trying to make it through to the next paycheck. America can only be destroyed from within. \ud83e\udd14",

My suggestion to the folks out there in this time period versus those from the 90\u2019s and earlier, take some time and really read the history of all policies from the past all the way to the current president. Our country has had its ups and downs, but it was never drowning like this administration has made it with inflation, a housing crisis, unnecessary wars, a Biden app invasion, and the taking away of jobs by closing an oil pipeline for US workers. That\u2019s unconstitutional and UN-American! \n\nTheater and nice words are not what this country needs right now. Our federal government needs to step up and help all borders of all fifty states, illegals need to be returned to where they came from, drug/human trafficking needs to end, and indoctrination of children needs to end. \n\nOur country needs unity, a growth mindset e.g. libertarian way of thinking, and a lot of prayer. Furthermore, politics shouldn\u2019t matter anymore. The truth is what sets us free\u2026Praise God and Amen! \u2764",

It would have been better for the Democrats to give someone else a chance, as Biden&#39;s approval ratings are not great. During his State of the Union speech, Biden claimed that childhood poverty had been halved. However, recent figures from NPR in 2023 showed that childhood poverty had doubled from 5.2% in 2022 to 12.4% in 2023. This was due to families receiving $2,000 monthly credit during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, which raised inflation and was a cause of the current doubling of poverty rates. Although police brutality is a major issue, reducing police budgets and loosening policing has caused more problems than it has solved. Police officers should be trained better, which requires funding to do so.",

America doesn't need male only white skin blue-eyed blonde haired supremacists with Rogue Republican, Rogue Christians, Rogue Catholics, and Rogue Evangelical supremacists along with the Rogue Donald J. Trump dominated and controlled our daily lives and banning the stories of writers from American libraries and schools demanding them unholy and telling our teachers what they desire to teach. What what if these same individuals start banning anime, comic book stores alongside p.c. and console gaming. What will you do then my fellow Americans quietly submit without a fight? As it seems that you're doing. They are already demanding what gender we should be and already stripped half of women's rights in America, and they are not going to stop unless they are forced and force is all they recognize. The LGBTQ plus community has the right to exist, and the community of non-white skinned humans has the right to exist in freedom. Also they're wanting to demand what religion we should be in and what God we should worship what culture we should be in all this shouldn't be decided for us that isn't governing it's not leading or guiding see it for what it truly is it force subjugation and enslavement if not a all too familiar plan for extermination to make room for a certain non-existing superior human tribe or race. Now my fellow Americans wake up before it is too late and END THE EVIL EMPIRE OF DONALD J. TRUMP BEFORE IT EVEN BEGINS.",

However, I stopped this thought when I remembered that supporters of the Orange Jesus also seem not to care about lying, theft, conspiracy to support and encourage sedition, tax evasion, corrupt business practices,  bigotry, hate-mongering, anti semitism, Holocaust denial. cheating, etc.  Then, I said to myself:\"  Well, gum-chewing at a State of the Union Address was a very petty complaint.  So, perhaps an effort could be made to pass a new Constitutional Law that guarantees that \"Every American has the right to chew gum.'  This, might solve America's troubles with their Gun Laws.  We already know that GOP supporters of the Orange Jesus cannot chew gum and walk at the same time.  Imagine the trouble they'd have loading, aiming and shooting a gun while knawing on Wriglies Gum.  \"Every American has the right to bear Gum.\"",

Poor memory does not make a person incompetent to stand trial. To declare someone incompetent to stand trial, they have to be examined by a doctor who determines 2 things, does he understand the charges against him and can he assist in his defense? In the real world Biden would have been indicted, then if he was declared incompetent to stand trial, the judge would order him to a mental hospital for treatment. If he was declared fit to stand trial, then his dementia could have been considered at sentencing and he would probably have been given a suspended sentence due to a mental defect. Biden gave an angry, but coherent state of the Union address, so he is competent to stand trial for his crimes. This  is a two tiered system of justice, where Biden commits crimes and nothing is done to him.",

So my Fentanyl plan is the same democrat plan for everything, toss US tax dollars at it. I ended the pandemic and only I could have done it. Forget that the vaccine was created under Trump and because of that, the lock downs were able to be lifted and people could go back to work. I'm taking full credit for all those people going back to work, in fact, I'm counting those jobs they went back to a jobs that \"I created\". Folks, if you reelect me I will continue to raise the national debt, buy votes with US tax dollars, weaken the USA, do nothing while WWIII draws closer because of weak US leadership and I will lower the value of the US dollar so much it will no longer be the world's reserve currency.",

All of the democrat criminals are ardent supporters of Joe and Barry, surprise, surprise!\n\nDemocrat \"public servants\" in positions across the local, state and federal levels appeared in Manhattan Supreme Court on a variety of different charges laid out in four indictments, including allegations they manufactured and sold 3D ghost guns, conspired to defraud New York\u2019s pandemic unemployment assistant program and committed burglary.\n\nThese schemes were orchestrated and largely operated by democrat city employees, many of whom abused their positions of public trust for personal gain.

His detractors should re-consider their doubts and support this President who has made America's economy stronger than ever. Imagine an unemployment rate less than 4 percent, including his plans to do so much where Healthcare, Education, School and Colleges, etc etc will all be improved.

Also his statement of the covid lockdowns being too late under Trump is funny since Biden made statements (twitter post) saying the covid lockdowns are irrational and racist when they were first in place (nancy pelosi also visited china town maskless march 2020 to boost tourism claiming the same thing). Biden also talked about cutting costs of medicine like insulin but in reality he delayed Trumps previous policy by pushing back the date from 2023 to 2027 for price reductions for big pharma.

This series of actions was taken in response to increasing inflation. The most notable components of the Nixon shock were:\r<br>\r<br>Wage and Price Freezes: Nixon issued Executive Order 11615, imposing a 90-day freeze on wages and prices. This was the first time the U.S. government had enacted wage and price controls since World War II. The wage and price controls were intended to curb inflation, but their impact and effectiveness remain subjects of historical analysis. After the 90-day freeze, increases in wages and prices required approval by a \u201cPay Board\u201d and a \u201cPrice Commission,\u201d with an eye toward eventually lifting controls\u2014conveniently, after the 1972 election.",
