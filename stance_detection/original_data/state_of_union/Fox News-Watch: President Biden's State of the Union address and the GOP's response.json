[Music] [Applause] w [Applause] everyone [Applause] he [Applause] me Tony thank you do good evening good evening if I were smart i' go home now Mr Speaker Madame vice president members of Congress my fellow Americans in January 1941 Franklin Roosevelt came to this chamber to speak to the nation and he said said I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union Hitler was on the March war was raging in Europe President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time freedom and democracy were under assault in the world tonight I come to the same chamber to address the nation now it's we who face unprecedented moment in the history of the union and yes my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been underall at home as they are today what makes our moment rare is that freedom of democracy are under attack at both at home and overseas at the very same time overseas Putin of Russia's on the March invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and Beyond if anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine I assure you he will not but Ukraine Ukraine can stop Putin Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that needs to defend itself that is all that is all Ukraine is asking they're not asking for American soldiers in fact there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine and I'm determined to keep it that way but now assistance Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership wasn't long ago when a Republican president named Ronald Reagan thundered Mr gorbachov tear down this wall now now my predecessor a former Republican president presid tells Putin quote do whatever the hell you want that's a quote a former president actually said that bowing down to a Russian leader I think it's outrageous it's dangerous and it's unacceptable America is a founding member of NATO the military Alliance of democratic nations created after World War II prevent to prevent war and keep the peace and today we've made NATO stronger than ever welcome Finland to the alliance last year and just this morning Sweden officially joined and their minister is here tonight stand up welcome welcome welcome welcome and they know how to fight Mr Prime Minister welcome to Nato the strongest military Alliance the world has ever seen I say this to Congress we have to stand up to Putin send me a bipartisan National Security Bill history is literally watching history is watching if the United States walks away it will put Ukraine at risk Europe is at risk the Free World be at risk and Bolding others to do what they wish to do us harm my message to President Putin who I've known for a long time is simple we will not walk away we will not bow down I will not bow down in a literal sense history is watching history is watching just like history watched three years ago on January 6th when Insurrection storm this very capital and place the dager the throat of American democracy many of you are here on that darkest of days we all saw with our own eyes the insurrectionists were not Patriots they' come to stop the peaceful transfer of power to over Stern the will of the people January 6 lies about the 2020 election and the plots that steal the election posed a great gravest threat to US democracy since a civil war but they failed America stood America stood strong and democracy prevailed we must be honest the threat to democracy must be defended my predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th I will not do that this is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies here's the simple truth you can't love your country only when you win as I've done ever since being elected to office I ask all of you without regard to party to join together and defend democracy remember your oath of office is defending against all threats foreign and domestic respect respect free and fair elections restore trust in our institutions and make clear political violence has absolutely no place no place in America zero place again it's not it's not hyperbole to suggest history is one watching or watching your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do history is watching another assault on freedom joining us to the light is Lor Beasley a social worker from Birmingham Alabama 14 months ago 14 months ago she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF she scheduled treatments to have that second child but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state Unleashed by Supreme Court decision overturning roie Wade she was told her dream would have to wait what her family had got through should never have happened unless Congress acts it could happen again so tonight let's stand up for families like hers to my friends across the aisle don't keep this waiting any longer guarantee the right to ABF guarantee a nationwide like most Americans I believe Ro we ra got it right I thank vice president Harris for being incredible leader defending reproductive freedom and so much more thank you my predecessor came to office determin to see roie Wade overturn he's the reason was overturned and he brags about it look at the chaos that has resulted joining us tonight is Kate Cox the wife and mother from Dallas she's become pregnant again and had a fetus of a fatal condition her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have F children in the future were at risk if she didn't act because Texas law banned her ability to act Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get what she needed what her family got through should have never happened as well but it's happening in too many others there are state laws Banning the freedom to choose criminalizing doctors forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states to get the treatment they need many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive Freedom my God what Freedom else would you take away look it's a decision to overturn Ro v Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote The Following and with all due respect justices women are not without electoral electoral power excuse me electoral or political power you're about to realize just how much you clearly clearly those bragging about overturning Roy weight have no clue about the power of women but they found out when reproductive Freedom was on the ballot we won in 2022 and 2020 and we're win again in 2024 if you if you the American people send me a Congress that supports the right to choose I promise you I'll restore roie Wade as the law of the land again folks America cannot go back I'm here to tonight to show what I believe is the way forward because I know how far we come four years ago next week before I came to office the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in the century remember the fear record losses remember the spikes and crime and the murder raging virus it took more than one million American lives of loved ones Millions left behind a mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness a president my predecessor failed the most basic presidential Duty that he owes to American people the duty to care I think that's unforgivable I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the nation's history we have it doesn't make new but news in a thousand cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told so let's tell the story here tell it here and now America's comeback is building the future of American possibilities building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down investing in all America in all Americans to make every sure everyone has a fair shot we leave no one no one behind the pandemic no longer controls Our Lives the vaccines that saved us from Co are now being used to beat cancer turning setback into comeback that's what America does that's what America does folks my inherited economy is on the brink now our economy is literally the Envy of the world 15 million new jobs in just three years a record a record unemployment at 50-year loads record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is a literal Act of Hope with historic job growth and small business growth for black and Hispanics and asian-americans 800,000 new manufacturing jobs in America and cting where is it written we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world we are and we will more people have health insurance today more people have health insurance today than ever before the racial wealth Gap is as small as it's been in 20 years wages keep going up inflation keeps coming down inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% the lowest in the world and tending lower The Landing is and will be soft and now instead of importing importing foreign products and exporting American jobs we're exporting American products and creating American jobs right here in America where they belong and it takes time but the American people are beginning to feel it consumer study show consumer confidence is soaring by America has been the law of the land since the 1930s past administration including my predecessor including some Democrats as well in the past failed to buy American not anymore on my watch Federal projects that you fund like helping build American roads Bridges and highways will be made with American products and built by American workers creating good paying American jobs and thanks to our chips and science act the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before during the pandemic a shortage of semiconductors chips that drove up the price of everything from cell phones to Automobiles and by the way we invented those chips right here in America well instead of having to import them instead of we private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America creating tens of thousands of jobs many of those jobs paying $100,000 a year and don't require a college degree in fact my policies have attracted $650 billion in private sector investment and clean energy Advanced manufacturing creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America and thanks and thanks to our bipartisan infrastructure law 46,000 new projects have announced all across your communities and by the way I know to some of you strongly voted against it are there cheering on that money coming in I like it I'm with you I'm with you if any of you don't want that money in your District just let me know modernize our roads and bridges ports and airports public transit systems removing po poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of brain damage providing affordable affordable high-speed internet for every American no matter where you live Urban Suburban or rural communities in red States and blue States record investments in tribal communities because of my investment in Family Farms because I invested in family was led by my sector of Agriculture knows more about this than anybody I know we're better able to stay in the family for the those farms for and their children and grandchildren won't have to leave leave home to make a living it's transformative the great comeback story is Bader Illinois home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years before I came to office the plant was on its way to shutting down thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods Hope was fading then I was elected to office and we raised the beler repeatedly with auto companies knowing Unions would make all the difference the UAW worked like hell to keep the plan open and get these jobs back and together we succeeded instead of Auto Factory shutting down Auto factories reopening a new state of the-art battery Factory is being built to power those cars there at the same folks the folks of belor I say instead of your town being left behind your community is moving forward again because I'm sit and watching Auto JB jobs of the future go overseas 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building the future in Bader right here in America here tonight is UAW president shaan Fain a great friend and a great labor leader Sean where are you stand up and and Dawn and Dawn sim a third generation worker UAW worker at badier Sean I was proud to be the first president to stand in the picket line and today dawn has a good job in her hometown providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well showing once again Street didn't build America they're not bad guys they didn't build it though the middle class built the country and unions built the middle class I say to the American people when America gets knocked down we get back up we keep going that's a America that's you the American people it's because of you America is coming back it's because of you our future is brighter it's because of you that tonight we can proudly say the state of our Union is strong and getting stronger tonight tonight I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together a future where the days of trickle down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get to allow the tax breaks and by the way I understand corporations I come from a state that has more corporations invested than every one of your states in the state United States combined and I represented for 36 years I'm not an anti-corporation but I grew up in a home where trickle down economics didn't put much on my Dad's kitchen table that's why I determined to turn things around so middle class does well when they do well the poor of a way up and the wealthy still do very well we all do well and there's more to do to make sure you're feeling the benefits of all we're doing Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world it's wrong and I'm ending it with a law that I propos and sign not one of you Republican buddies work voted for it we finally beat big Pharma instead of paying $400 a month or there B for insulin with diabetes and it only cost 10 bucks to make they only get paid 35 a month now and still make a healthy profit and I want to but what to do next I want to cap the cost of insulin $35 a month for every American in egy everyone for years people have talked about it but finally we got it done gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs just like the VA is able to do for veterans that's not just saving seniors money it's saving taxpayers money we cut the federal deficit by a $60 billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big farmer this year Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market to treat everything from heart disease to arthritis it's now time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade they're making a lot of money guys and they'll still be extremely profitable will not only save lives it will save taxpayers another2 200 billion dollar starting next year the same law caps total prescription drug cost for seniors on Medicare at2 200 $2,000 a year even for expensive Cancer drugs that cost 10 12 $15,000 I want a cap prescription drug cost of $22,000 a year for everyone folks I'm going to get in trouble for saying that but any you want to get an Air Force woman and fly to Toronto Berlin Moscow I mean excuse me and it well even Moscow probably and bring your prescription with you and I promise you I'll get it for you for 40% the cost you're paying now same company same drug same place folks the Affordable Care Act the old Obamacare it's still a very big deal over 100 million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of pre-existing condition but my predecessor and many in this chamber want to take prescription drug Away by repealing Affordable Care Act I'm not going to let that happen we stopped you 50 times before and will stop you again in fact I'm not only protecting it I'm expanding it the we the enacted tax credits of $800 per person per year reduce healthc care costs for millions of working families that tax credit expires next year I want to make that savings permanent to State the obvious women are more than half our population but research on women's health has always been underfunded that's why we're launching the first ever White House initiative on women's health research led by Jill doing an incredible job as first lady to pass my plan for $1 billion do to transfer women's health research and benefit millions of lives all across America I know the cost of housing is so important to you if inflation keeps coming down mortgage rates will come down as well and the FED acknowledges that but I'm not waiting I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgages when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space just for two years and my Administration is also eliminating Title Insurance on federally backed mortgages when you re Finance your home you can save $11,000 or more as a consequence for millions of renters we're cracking down on big landlords who use antitrust law using anti who break antitrust laws by price fixing and driving up rents we've cut red tape so Builders can get federally financing which is already helping build a record 1.7 million new house housing units Nationwide now pass now pass and build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring those rents down Remain the strongest economy in the world we need to have the best education system in the world and I like I suspect all of you want to give a child every child a good start by providing access to preschool for three and four years old you know I think I pointed out last year I think I pointed out last year that children coming from broken homes where there's no books and not red to not spoken to very often start school kindergarten or first grade hearing having heard a million fewer words spoken well studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50% more likely to finish High School go on to earn a two and four year degree no matter what their background is I met year and a half half ago with the leaders of the business Round Table they were mad that I they were angry I said well they were disgusing why I wanted to spend money on education I pointed out to them as vice president I met with over eight I think it was 182 of those folks don't hold me the exact number and uh I asked them what they need most the CEOs and you've had the same experience to both sides D they say a better educated Workforce right so I looked at them and I say I come from Delaware the Pont used to be the eighth largest corporation in the world and every new Enterprise they bought they educated the workforce to that Enterprise but none of you do that anymore why are you angry with me providing you the opportunity for the best educated Workforce in the world they all looked at me and said I think you're right I want to expand highquality tutoring and sum are learning to see that every child learns to read by third grade I'm also connecting local businesses in high schools so students get hands-on experience in a path to good paying job whether or not they go to college and I want to make sure the college is more affordable let's continue increasing the pel grants to working in Middle Class families and increased record investments in HBCU and minority serving institution including Hispanic institution when I was told I couldn't universally just change the way in which we did deal dealt with student loans I fixed two student loan programs that already existed to reduce the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans including nurse firefighters and others in public service like Keenan Jones a public educator from Minnesota who's here with us tonight Keenan where are you Kenan thank you he's educated hundreds of students so they can go to college now he's able to help after debt forgiveness get his own daughter to college FKS look such relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home start a business start a family while we're at it I want to give Public School teachers a raise and by the way the first couple years we cut the deficit now let me speak to the question of fundamental fairness for all Americans I've been delivering Real Results in fiscally responsible ways we've already cut the federal deficit we've already cut the federal of over a trillion dollars I signed the bipartisan deal I cut another trillion dollar in the next decade it's my goal to cut the federal defic another three trillion by making big corporations the very wealthy finally beginning to pay their fair share look I'm a capitalist you want to make or can make a million or millions of bucks that's great just pay your fair share in taxes a fair tax code is how we invest things to make this country great Healthcare education defense and so much more but here's the deal the last Administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefit the topping 1% the very wealthy and the biggest corporation and exploded the federal deficit they added more to the national debt than any presidential term in American history check the numbers Folks at home does anybody really think the tax code is fair do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break I sure don't I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair under my plan nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay additional penny in federal taxes nobody not one penny and they haven't yet in fact the child tax credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half restore that child tax benedit no child should go hungry in this country the way to make the tax code fair is to make big corporations the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share remember in 2020 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in federal income tax zero not anymore thanks to the law I wrote when we signed big companies have to pay a minimum 15% but that's still less than working people paying federal taxes it's time to raise corporate minimum tax to at least 21% so every big Corporation finally begins to pay their fair share I also want to end tax breaks for big farmer Big Oil private checks massive executive pay when it's only supposed to be a million a million dollars it could be deducted they can pay 20 million if they want but deduct a million end it now you know there are 1,000 billionaires in America you know what the average federal tax is for those billionaires no they're making great sacrifices 88.2% that's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay no billionaire should pay a lower federal tax rate than a teacher a sanitation worker or a nurse I propose a minimum tax for billionaires of 25% just 25% you know what that would raise that would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years and imagine what that could do for America imagine a future with affordable child care millions of families can get they need to go to work to help grow the economy imagine a future with paid lead because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of their sick family member imagine imagine the future of Home Care and elder care and people living with disabilities so they can stay in their homes and Family Care can finally get the pay they deserve tonight let's all agree once again to stand up for seniors many of my friends on the other side of I want to put Social Security on The Chopping Block if anyone here tries to cut Social Security Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop you the working people the working people who built this country pay more into Social Security than Millionaires and billionaires do it's not fair we have two ways to go Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy I will that's the proposal oh no you guys don't want another $2 trillion tax cut I kind of thought that's what your plan was well that's good to hear you're not going to cut another $2 trillion for the super wealth that's good to hear I'll protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share look too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits charging more and more for less and less that's why cracking down on corporations engag in price gouging and deceptive pricing from food to healthc care to housing in fact the snack companies think you won't notice if they change the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer same same size bag put fewer chips in it no I'm not joking it's called Shing FL pass Bobby Casey's Bill and stop this I really mean it you probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars you get you get charge the same amount and you got about I don't know 10% fewer Snickers in it look I'm also getting rid of junk fees those hidden fees at the end of your bill that are there without your knowledge my Administration announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to [Music] $8 Banks and credit card companies are allowed to charge what it cost them to in to instigate the the collection and that's more a hell of a lot like $8 and 30 some dollars they don't like it credit card companies don't like it but I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with all the junk fees I'm eliminating Folks at home that's why the banks are so mad it's $20 billion in profit I'm not stopping there my Administration propos rules to make cable travel utilities online ticket sellers tell you the total price UPF front so there're no surprises it matters it matters and so does this in November my team began serious negotiation with a bipartisan group of senators the result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen oh you don't think so oh you don't like that bill huh that conservatives got together and said it was a good bill I'll be darn that's amazing that bipartisan would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers 100 more immigration judges help tackle the backload of 2 million cases 4,300 more Asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of six years now what are you against 100 more Hightech drug detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop Vehicles smuggling fentanyl into America that's killing thousands of children this bill would save lives and bring order the Border it will also give me and any new president new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the Border when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming the border patrol Union has endorsed this bill the federal Chamber of Commerce is yeah yeah you're saying L look at the facts I know I know you know how to read I believe that giving the opportunity for a majority in the House and Senate would endorse the bill as well the majority right now but unfortunately politics has derailed this bill so far I'm told my predecessor called members of Congress and the Senate to demand they block the bill he feels political win he viewed as be a political win for me and a political loser for him it's not about him it's not about me I'd be a winner not really [Applause] I Lincoln Lincoln Riley an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal that's right but how many thousands of people being killed by legals to her parents I say my heart goes out to you having lost children myself I understand but look if we change the dynamic at the border people pay people people pay these Smugglers 8,000 bucks to get across the border because they know if they get by if they get by and let into the country it's 6 to 8 years before they have a hearing and it's worth taking the chance of the $8,000 but but if it's only six month six weeks the idea is as highly unlikely that people will pay that money and come all that way knowing that they'll be able to be kicked out quickly folks I would respectfully say to suggest my friend my Republican friends to the American people get this bill done we need to act now and of my predecessor is watching instead of paying politics and pressuring members of Congress to block the bill join me in telling the Congress to pass it we can can do it together but that's what he apparently here's what he will not do I will not demonize immigrants saying they are poison in the blood of our country I will not separate families I will not ban people because of their faith unlike my predecessor on my first day in office I introduced a comprehensive Bill to fix our immigration system take a look at it as all these more secure the Border provide a pathway to citiz for dreamers and so much more but unlike my predecessor I know who we are as Americans we're the only nation in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new home to Native Americans his ancestors have been here for thousands of years home to people of every play from every place on Earth they came freely some came in Chains some came when famine struck like my ancestral family in Ireland some to flee persecution to chase dreams that are impossible Anywhere But Here in America that's America and we all come from somewhere but we're all americ look folks we have a simple choice we can fight about fixing the Border or we can fix it I'm ready to fix it send me the Border bill now a transformational his moment in history happened 58 59 years ago today in Selma Alabama hundreds of foot solders for justice marched across the Edmund Pettis Bridge Bridge named after the Grand Dragon of the clucas clan to claim their fundamental right to vote they were beaten they were bloody and left for dead our late friend and former colleague John Lewis was on that March we Mission but joining us tonight are other Marchers both in the gallery and on the floor including Betty May Fikes known as the voice of Selma the daughter of gospel singers and preachers she sang songs of prayer and protest on that Bloody Sunday to help shake the nation's conscience five months later the Voting Rights Act passed him a signing the law thank you thank you thank you thank you but 59 years later their forces taking us back in time voter suppression election subversion unlimited dark money extreme manering John Lewis is a great friend to many of us here but if you truly want to honor him and all the heroes of March with him then it's time to do more than talk pass the freedom to vote act to John L is voting right now and stop stop denying another core value of America our diversity across American Life Banning books it's wrong instead of erasing history let make history I want to protect fundamental rights pass equality act am I message of transgender American I have your back pass the pro act for workers rights raise the federal minimum wage because every worker has a right to a decent living more than a seven bucks an hour we're also making history by confronting the climate crisis not denying it I don't think any of you think there's no longer climate crisis at least I hope you don't I'm taking the most significant action ever on climate in the history of the world I'm cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030 creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs like the ibw work is building ining 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations conserving 30% of America's lands and Waters by 2030 taking action on environmental justice fence line Community smothered by the legacy of pollution and pattern after the Peace Corp and America Corp I launched the climate Corp to put 20,000 young people to work in the Forefront of our Clean Energy Future I'll triple that number in a decade the state the obvious all Americans deserve the freedom to be safe and and America is safer today than when I took office year before I took office murder rates went up 30% 30% they went [Music] up the biggest increase in history it was then through no through my American Rescue plan which every American voted against I'm mad at we made the largest investment in public safety ever last year the murder rate saw the sest decrease in history violent crime fell to one of its lowest levels in more than 50 years but we have more to do we have to help cities invest in more Community police officers more mental health workers more Community violence in benen give communities the tool to crack down on gun crime retail crime and car jacking keep building trust as they' been doing by taking executive action on police reform and calling for it to be the law of the land directing my cabinet to review the federal classification of marijuana expunging thousands of convictions for the mere possession because no one should be jailed for simply using or have it on their record take on crimes and domestic violence I'm ramping up the Federal enforcement of the violence against women act that I proudly wrote when I was a Senator so we can finally finally end the scourge against women in America there other kinds of violence I want to stop with us tonight is Jasmine whose nine-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmat and teachers in elementary school in Uvaldi Texas very soon after that happened Jill and I went to Uvaldi for a couple days we spent hours and hours with each of the families we heard their message so everyone in this room room in this chamber could hear the same message the constant refrain and I was there for hours meeting with every family they said do something do something well I did do something by establishing the first ever office of gun violence prevention in the White House that the vice president is leading a charge thank you for doing it meanwhile Meanwhile my predecessor told the NRA he's proud he did nothing on guns when he was president after another shooting in Iowa recently he said when asked what to do about it he said just get over it there was his quote just get over it I say stop it stop it stop it stop it I'm proud we beat the NRA when I signed most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years because of this Congress we now must beat the NRA again I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazine pass Universal background checks none of this none of this I taught the Second Amendment for 12 years none of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners you know as we manag challenges at home we're also managing crisis abroad including in the Middle East I know the last five months have been gut-wrenching for so many people for the Israeli people for the Palestinian people and so many here in America this Crisis began on October 7th with the massacre by terrorist group called Hamas as you all know 1,200 innocent people women and girls men and boys slaughtered after enduring sexual violence the deadliest day of the for the Jewish people since the Holocaust and 250 hostages taken here in this chamber tonight our families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring everyone of your loved ones home we also we will also work around the clock to bring home Evan and Paul Americans being unjustly detained by the Russians and others around the world Israel has the right to go after Hamas Hamas ended this conflict by releasing hostages laying down arms could end it by by releasing the hostages laying down arms and surrendering those responsible for October 7th but Israel has a excuse me Israel has a added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population like cowards under hospitals daycare centers and all the like it Isel also has a fundamental responsibility though to protect innocent civilians in [Music] Gaza this war has taken a greater toll on innocent vilians than all previous Wars in Gaza combined more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed most of whom are not Hamas thousands and thousands of Innocents women and children girls and boys also orphaned nearly 2 million more Palestinians under bombardment or displacement homes destroyed neighborhoods and Rubble cities in ruin families without food water medicine it's heartbreaking I've been working non-stop to establish an immediate ceasefire that would last for 6 weeks to get all the prisoners released all the hostage released to get the hostages home and ease the Intolerable in humanitarian crisis and build toward an enduring a more something more enduring the United States have been leading international off to get more humanitarian assistance of Gaza tonight I'm directing the US military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food water medicine and temporary shelters no us boots will be on the ground a temporary peer will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every [Music] day and Israel must do its part Israel must allow more Aid in the gods who ensure humanitarian workers aren't caught in the crossfire and they're announcing they're going to they're going to C have a Crossing in Northern Gaza for the leadership of Israel I say this humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining ship protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority as we look to the Future the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time and I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel my entire career no one has a stronger record with Israel than I do I challenge any of you here I'm the only American president of is Israel in Wartime but there is no other path that guarantees Israel's security and democracy there's no other path that guarantees Palestinian can live in peace with PO with peace and dignity there's no other P that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its neighbors including Saudi Arabia with whom I've talking creating stability in the Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran that's why I build a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea I've ordered strikes to degrade the houthi capability and defend US forces in the region as commander and chief I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel for years I've heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise and America is falling behind they've got it backwards I've been saying it for over four years even when I wasn't president America is rising we have the best economy in the world and since I've come to office R GTP is up our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade and we're standing up against China's unfair economic practices we're standing enough for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits I've revitalized our partnership and Alliance in the Pacific India Australia Japan South Korea Pacific Islands I've made sure that the most advanced American Technologies can't be used in China not allowing to trade them there frankly for all this tough talk on China it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that I want competition with China not conflict and we're in a stronger position to win the conflict of the 21st century against China than anyone else for that matter than any time as well here at home I've signed over 400 bipartisan bills there's more to pass my Unity agenda strengthen penalties on fentanyl trafficking you don't want to do that huh pass bipartisan prophecy that say to protect our children online harness harness the promise of AI to protect us from Peril ban AI voice impersonations and more and keep our truly sacred obligation to train and equip those we send in the Harm's Way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't that's why the song support and help of Dennis the VA I signed the PCT act one of the most significant laws ever helping millions of veterans exposed to toxins who now are battling more than 100 different cancers many of them don't come home but we owe them and their families support we owe it to ourselves to keep supporting our new health research agency called rph and remind us remind us that we can do big things like and cancer as we know it and we will let me close with this [Applause] hey I know you don't want to hear any more Lindsay but I got to say a few more things I know it may not look like it but I've been around a while when you get to be my age certain things become clearer than ever I know the American story again and again I've seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation between those who want to pull America back to the past those who want to move America into the future my lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy a future based on core values that defined America honesty decency dignity equality to respect everyone to give everyone a fair chop to give hate no Safe Harbor now other people my age see it differently the American story of resentment revenge and retribution that's not me I was born in mid World War II when America stood for the freedom of the world I grew up in scr Pennsylvania in Claymont Delaware among Working Class People who built this country I watched in horror as two of my her like many of you did Dr King and Bobby cunning were assassinated and their legacy then smir me to pursue a a career in service I left the law firm became a public defender because my city of Wilmington was the only city in America occupied by the National Guard after Dr King was assassinated because of the riots and I became a county councilman almost by accident I got elected to the United States Senate when I had no intention of running at age 29 then vice president our first black president now president to the first women vice president in my career I've been told I was too young by the way they didn't let me on the Senate elevators for votes sometimes not a joke and I've been told I'm too old whether young or old I've always been known I've always known what endures I've known our North Star the very idea of America is that we're all created equal and deserves to be treated equally throughout our lives we've never fully lived up to that idea but we've never walked away from it either and I won't walk away from it now I'm optimistic I really am I'm optimistic ncy my fellow Americans the issue facing our nation isn't how old we are it's how old are our ideas hate anger Revenge ret ution are the oldest of ideas but you can't lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back you lead America the land of possibilities you need a vision for the future and what can and should be done tonight you've heard mine I see a future where defending democracy you don't diminish it I see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms not take them away I see a future for the middle class has finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence above all I see a future for all Americans I see a country for all Americans and I will always be president for all Americans because I believe in America I believe in you the American people you're the reason we've never been more optimistic about our future than I am now so let's build the future together let's remember who we are we are the United States of America and there is nothing nothing beyond our capacity when we act together God bless you all and may God protect our troops thank you thank you thank you [Applause] [Applause] hey Bobby it didn't embarass did for to get it back PR you preacher tonight I'll tell you

uhuh I have stuff back here that I have to I think around is probably best yes yes yes yes seven you're hot five good evening America my name is Katie Britt and I have the honor of serving the people of the great state of Alabama and the United States Senate however that's not the job that matters most I am a proud wife and mom of two school-aged kids my daughter Bennett and my son Ridgeway are why I ran for the Senate I'm worried about their future and the future of children in every corner of our nation and that's why I invited you into our home tonight like so many families Across America my husband Wesley and I just watched President Biden State of the Union Address from our living room and uh what we saw was the performance of a permanent politician who has actually been in office for longer than I've been alive one thing was quite clear though President Biden just doesn't get it he's out of touch under his administration families are worse off our communities are less safe and our country is less secure I just wish he understood what real families are facing around kitchen tables just like this one you know this is where our family has tough conversations it's where we make hard decisions it's where we share The Good the Bad and the Ugly of our days it's where we laugh together and it's where we hold each other's hands and pray for God's guidance and many nights to be honest it's swear Wesley and I worry I know we're not alone and so tonight the American family needs to have a tough conversation because the truth is we're all worried about the future of our nation the country we know and love seems to be slipping away and it feels like the next generation will have fewer opportunities and less freedoms than we did I worry my own children may not even get a shot at Living their American Dreams my American Dream allowed me the daughter of two small business owners from rural Enterprise Alabama to be elected to the United States Senate at the age of 40 growing up sweeping the floor at my dad's hardware store and cleaning the bathroom at my mom's dance studio I never could have imagined what my story would entail to think about what the American dream can do across just one generation in just one lifetime it's truly breathtaking but right now the American dream has turned into a nightmare for so many families the true unvarnished state of our Union begins and ends with this our families are hurting our country can do better and you don't have to look any further than the crisis at our Southern border to see it President Biden inherited the most secure border of all time but minutes after taking office he suspended all deportations he halted construction of the border wall and he announced a plan to give amnesty to Millions we know that President Biden didn't just create this border crisis crisis he invited it with 94 executive actions in his first 100 days when I took office I took a different approach I traveled to the Del Rio sector of Texas that's where I spoke to a woman who shared her story with me she had been sex trafficked by the cartels starting at the age of 12 she told me not just that she was raped every day but how many times a day she was raped the cartels put her on a mattress in a shoe box of a room and they sent men through that door over and over again for hours and hours on end we wouldn't be okay with this happening in in a third world country this is the United States of America and it is pastime in my opinion that we start acting like it President Biden's border policies are a disgrace this crisis is Despicable and the truth is it is almost entirely preventable from fentel point poisonings horrific murders there are empty chairs tonight at kitchen tables just like this one because of President Biden's senseless border policies just think about Lake and Riley in my neighboring state of Georgia this beautiful 22-year-old nursing student went out on a jog one morning morning but she never got the opportunity to return home she was brutally murdered by one of the millions of illegal border crossers President Biden chose to release into our homeland y'all as a mom I can't quit thinking about this I mean this could have been my daughter this could have been yours and tonight President Biden finally said her name but he refused to take responsibility for his own actions Mr President enough is enough innocent Americans are dying and you only have yourself to blame fulfill your oath of office reverse your policies end this this crisis and stop the suffering sadly we know that President Biden's failures don't stop there his Reckless spending dug our economy into a hole and sent the cost of living through the roof we have the worst inflation in 40 years and the highest credit card debt in our nation's history let that seem in hardworking families are struggling to make ends meet today and with soaring mortgage rates and Sky High child care cost they're also struggling to how a plan for tomorrow the American people are scraping by while President Biden proudly proclaims that bid nomics is working goodness y'all bless his heart we know better I'll never forget stopping at a gas station in shilton County one evening the gentleman working the counter told me that after retiring he had to pick up a job in his 70s so that he didn't have to choose between going hungry or going without his medication he said I I did everything right I did everything I was told to do I worked hard I saved I was responsible he's not alone I hear similar concerns from fellow parents whether I am walking with my friends or whether I'm at my kids games but let's be honest it's been a minute since Joe Biden pumped gas uh ran a carpool or even pushed a g grocery cart meanwhile the rest of us see our dollar and we know it doesn't go as far we see it every day and despite what he tells you our communities are not safer for years the left has coddled criminals and defunded the police all while letting repeat offenders walk free the result is tragic but foreseeable from our small counts to America's most iconic city streets life is getting more and more dangerous and unfortunately President Biden's weakness isn't just hurting families here at home he is making us a punchline on the world's stage look where I'm from your word is your bond but for 3 years the president has demonstrated that America's word doesn't mean what it used to from abandoning our allies in his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan to desperately pushing another dangerous deal with Iran President Biden has failed we've become a nation in Retreat and the enemies of Freedom they see an opportunity Putin's brutal aggression in Europe has put our allies on the brink Iran's terrorist proxies have slaughtered Israeli Jews and American citizens they've targeted commercial shipping and they've attacked our troops nearly 200 times since October killing three US soldiers and two Navy Seals meanwhile the Chinese Communist party is undercutting America's workers China is buying up our Farmland spying on our military installations and spreading propaganda through the likes of tiktock you see the CCP knows that if it conquers the minds of our next Generation it Con ERS America and what does President Biden do well he bans Tik Tock for government employees but creates an account for his own campaign y'all you can't make this stuff up look we all recall when presidents faced National Security threats with strength and resolve that seems like ancient ient history right now our commander in chief is not in command the Free World deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader America deserves leaders who recognize that secure borders stable prices Safe Streets and a strong defense are actually the corner stones of a great nation just ask yourself are you better off now than you were three years ago there's no doubt we're at of Crossroads and it doesn't have to be this way we all feel it but here's the good news we the people are still and the driver's seat we get to decide whether our future will grow brighter or whether we'll settle for an America in Decline well I know which Choice our children deserve and I know the choice the Republican party is fighting for we are the party of hardworking parents and families and we want to give you and your children the opportunities to thrive and we want families to grow it's why we strongly support continued Nationwide access to invitro fertilization we want to help loving moms and dads bring precious life into this world Wesley and I believe there is no greater blessing and life than our children and that's why tonight I want to make make a direct appeal to the parents out there and in particular to my fellow moms many of whom I know will be up tossing and turning at 2: a.m. wondering how you're going to be in three places at once and then somehow still get dinner on the table first of all we see you we hear you and we stand with you I know you're frustrated I know you're probably disgusted by most of what you see going on in Washington and I'll be really honest with you you're not wrong for feeling that way look I get it the task in front of us isn't an easy one but I can promise you one thing it is worth it so I am asking you for the sake of your kids and your grandkids get into to the arena every generation has been called to do hard things American greatness rests in the fact that we always answer that call it's who we are never forget we are steeped in the blood of patriots who overthrew the most powerful Empire in the world we walk in the footsteps of pioneers who tamed the wild we now carry forward the same flame of Freedom as the liberators of an oppressed Europe we continue to draw Courage from those who bent the moral Arc of the universe and when we gaze upon the heavens never forget that our DNA contains the same ingenuity that put man on the moon America has been tested before and every single time we've emerged unbowed and unbroken our history has been written with the grit of men and women who got knocked down but we know their stories because they did not stay down we are here because they stood back up so now it's our turn our moment to stand up and prove ourselves worthy of protecting the American dream together we can reawaken the heroic Spirit of a great nation because America we don't just have a Rendevous with Destiny we take take Destiny's hand and we lead it our future starts around kitchen tables just like this with moms and dads just like you and you are why I believe with every fiber of my being that despite the current state of our Union our best days are still a head may God bless you and may God continue to bless these United States of America",

Where's his office of misinformation on this? Instead of banning so called assault weapons. BTW what is your definition of an assault weapon?  How about harsher penalties for those that use a gun to commit a crime?  Responsible gun owners don't shoot people except in self defense. No gun has ever killed anyone. The person handling the gun is the one that kills. \nThe reason our trade defect is low with China is because of Trump's tariffs. The reason chip manufacturing in back in the US is because of Trump. He did the ground work to get the plant built in Ohio.",

Republicans, none of you deserve brownie points or respect from your constituents for doing what you did: sitting and making frowny faces and shaking your heads, while this narcissistic megalomaniac told one glaring lie after another and disparaged \"my predecessor\", whose name the coward couldn't say.  Who was he even referring to?  It could've been any former president, really, or a member of Congress, for that matter.  We know it wasn't President Trump, as it is a fact that President Trump did not say that Russia could \"do whatever the hell they want\", but Obama was caught on a hot mike making secret promises to Putin.",

NO third party has ever came close & this election has way too much to risk at this juncture. The USA you want is the same or very similar to Trump & MAGA ideology. If we do not stand united the Biden admin & their insanity will reek more havoc to a point where the USA as we've known it will be no more. Here's how I currently see things: I'D RATHER VOTE & HAVE AN IDIOT WITH POLICIES THAT WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN LIEU OF AN IDIOT WITH POLICIES THAT ARE AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! People leaving the left because of their insane policies are the exact reason why people did not vote for them in 2020. We on the same page...so LETS UNITE!",

The tax cuts under Trump didn&#39;t work. <br>Greedy corporations have over inflated their profits. President Biden is not responsible for the WORLD&#39;S inflation, it&#39;s not just here in the states.  President Biden is for better pay, and benefits.

Research for yourself and don&#39;t trust the MSM like Fox to tell you how to feel. <br>Unemployment is down,  inflation is coming down,  Social security saw its biggest COLA in years, critical drug costs are capped.

Did he know that he has the authority to invoke the Defense Production Act without needing Congress to agree so that ammunition supplies, artillery shells, and other military equipment production could be increased and supplied to Ukraine?  I am also going to say not.  Did he explain why he continues to forgive student loan debt and transfer that debt to other taxpayers even though the Supreme Court told him that he did not have the authority to do so?  Again I am going to say he didn't.",
