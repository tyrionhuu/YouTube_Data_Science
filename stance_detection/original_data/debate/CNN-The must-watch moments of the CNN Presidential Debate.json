We use to be financially secure, went from owning our beautiful 3 story home in a safe area  to renting a 3 bedroom dump for $2,200 here in Indianapolis Indiana. In a bad area. $2,200!!!! Had to sale our suv because of the gas prices increasing so drastically. Now we have to try to accommodate my 6 children in a sedan. It was all so much easier under president Trump. My husband and I didn\u2019t STRUGGLE to raise our children. We didn\u2019t struggle to put gas in our cars or food on our table. We had a beautiful home. As a Colombian immigrant who WORKED HARD for YEARS to come to this country LEGALLY, I am sick and tired of seeing these illegal immigrants cross over into our country with absolute disregard to our laws.

I may be right ,I may be wrong but the world is watching you and the preferred candidate in Mr. Biden in our books. Democracy is first and foremost and you don't appear to be diplomatic Mr Trump.",

Many individuals require government loans and other facilities to facilitate their ventures. Those with connections and access to quotas often receive these benefits more readily. Even if we manage to start our own businesses, we often face challenges such as unofficial taxes and corruption by certain factions. Given these circumstances, for many, securing a stable job remains the most viable option.\n\nFurthermore, over the past ten years, only a minimal number of people have been able to join the Bangladesh Civil Service through quotas (are descendants of freedom fighters). but over 50% of jobs belongs to quota system (several others quota) . However, many positions have been filled by individuals who could afford to buy the question papers before exams. This raises the question: where are the truly talented individuals? Unfortunately, it appears there is little room for common and talented individuals from less privileged backgrounds.\n\nMoreover, according to some renowned articles, only 0.5% of the total population are descendants of freedom fighters. How can the government label the remaining 99.5% as people who supported Pakistan in 1971, branding them as so-called \"rajakars\" or traitors? \n\nCurrently, students across Bangladesh are protesting, but the government is responding with brutal violence. Students are being mercilessly killed by government-sanctioned gangsters and police forces, turning peaceful demonstrations into tragic bloodbaths. To make matters worse, the government is cutting off the internet, confiscating phones, and preventing journalists from entering university halls during these massive killings and acts of torture.",

As someone who lives in Texas we are directly impacted!!!! Luckily, we have a governor that sends group of them to states that welcomed them into the country. Now, apparently they are mad about it too! So maybe those states might think about closing the border unless you want more people being busses into your cities too!",

It's just that this year the candidates' shortcomings are more obvious. We don't have a democracy, we have a plutocracy, and the minds of those steered pathologically by wealth continue to distort US policy, particularly foreign policy, down an extremely dangerous road of violence and injustice from which the species and planet may never recover.

We are receiving about 50% of foreign support from US, we are grateful for this. What did Biden actually do to end the war in Ukraine except sending us money and weapons(that actually prolongs the conflict)? Fighting fire with fire is not a good idea. I think this is actually leading us to the third world war. On the other hand, what will happen to Ukraine if Trump becomes the president and stops supporting us? Will Putin seeing this invade other countries and begin the third world war? I am actually scared about what the future will bring to us. They play with fire and human lives, thousands of people have already died, innocent chilrden also die, how much more will die because of decisions of our leaders? We should find a way to end the war until it will lead us to nowhere.  If I was an American, I am not sure which candidate I would have voted for, but I would make my decision based on their politics rather than on their age. I can see lots of comments here saying that Baiden is quite old, however, we should not choose Trump only based on his age. You have an important choice to make, this choice will affect entire humanity. I voted for Volodymyr Zelenskiy back in 2019, I do not regret about my decision. I think he is doing everything that depends on him for our country. If big leaders such as China, India, USA actually wanted to end the war, they would do everything that depends on them to achieve that. But I can actually only see how they are playing with fire instead of choosing the path to peace. That is just my opinion.",

Trump will sell out Europe and I as a European have a complete open mind about America and its future, but Americans please wake up about Trump, He's nothing but a talker and a dictator. The world depends on the USA for security, Biden is starting to show his age and the pressures of the job as being the president but if he wins his second in command could be a good replacement so long as Trump doesn't get in. Please rethink not just for America but the world as a whole. If its not for the Americans Russia would already be in London, Dublin and Madrid. WE NEED A SOLID USA not a dysfunctional one. Lead by example and show the world how powerful you are by choosing Biden and not Trump.",

Now, look at what happened: chaos erupted, and gas prices soared globally because the oil trade is no longer supported in the international market. The supply has dwindled, whereas it could have been stable if the war had not occurred between the two nations.\n\nPresident Biden is the real troublemaker here. Unlike Trump, who focused on trade and business, the world would have advanced in technology if not for the pandemic. During Trump's time, countries were only concerned with trade and economic growth. Problems would have been isolated within each country and not become global issues. But this old geezer, Biden, knows nothing but to endanger the world, including his people and the good people of Russia. Biden, you're truly a menace.",

He has already destroyed the Supreme Court, but all you care about is how someone speaks and that they look old and fragile. Would you vote for an aging priest or Hitler? Its not that difficult. So many people died in civil rights to get important laws favoring equality passed, and they are all now going to be mean NOTHING. I will vote for anyone to prevent Trump from coming back in office. I wish we had someone who knew how to unite the country instead of take one side. That's what we need, but we may not have it. The right leader would rise above personal insults and focus on the issues affecting each and every state, because America is everyone in it, Red and Blue states.  The way to destroy a country is to cause division and that is what Trump has done. Leadership and civility has fallen and it's sad that I can't look at the House and Senate with the respect it should have because of the representatives and their lack of class, intelligence, and honor.  So just because we don't have it, it does not mean you give up and not vote to prevent the further destruction of this country.",

Some semi-trucks already have them installed.  The sensor disengages the accelerator when approaching another vehicle in the same lane around 25 to 30 yards.  Would be better if they made it 40 to 50 yards.  This spreads out the traffic and reduces wrecks.   \nOn another Bill or on the same Bill proposal  -    A mandate to install heavy duty front end cages at the auto and truck manufacturing plant , similar to the ones already on many pick- up trucks, police vehicles, and semi- trucks.  The cage can be installed on front and rear of vehicle.  Or the rear of vehicle must have a heavy duty bumper with shock absorbers attached to the frame/chasis of the vehicle.  \nThe sides of the vehicle, to protect the doors,  can install a solid heavy duty cross beam step,  mounted high enough for front end vehicle impact, like many new pick- up trucks already have.  Steering wheel air bags and dashboard airbags discontinued.     \ud83d\udc2a  \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd27\ud83d\udc6e  \ud83c\udfc7  \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2708\ufe0f",

His brother committed suicide and he knows what it is like to lose someone he loves, just like President Biden. Far left Democrats are cheating and will continue to cheat. We have to remember the good and real democrats of years ago, the Democrats of Benson and Kennedy. They would understand that uniting the country and voting for President Trump over a man who can\u2019t even think or put sentences together, makes sense. Praying for our country as we have huge aggressors trying to see us fall. May America continue the Best Country in the World!",

It\u2019s because we are all fighting and a lot of Americans can\u2019t put their FEELINGS  aside for their country If you really don\u2019t think trump wants America to succeed as a whole, try to set aside your bad feelings and be 100% objective and take a look at the facts. We put trump in office cuz we didn\u2019t want a life long politician who takes advantage of the system and TRUMP PROVED THATS WHAT HE WAS DOING ! Something we needed to happen. Someone to shine a light on all the lies. he obviously doesn\u2019t care blue or red he did whatever he needed to do to get in to office??? Doesn\u2019t matter who it is to me, if Biden was doing what trumps been doing and trump was mentally lost I WOULD VOTE BIDEN WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE WHOSE SO IN THEIR FEELINGS THAT YOULL RUN A COUNTRY INTO THE GROUND BEFORE YOU JUST QUIT CRYING ADMIT YOU GOT CARRIED AWAY CUZ YOU DIDNT LIKE SOMEONE AND YOU DONT KNOW WHY AND MOVE ON AND ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK FIXING WHATS FUCKED NOW BC OF YOUR ACTIONS! All the people who didn\u2019t 180 on trump out of nowhere have to roll our sleeves up and fix what YOU fucked up and we aren\u2019t crying about it! PEOPLE NOT TAKING\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR BULLSHIT AND CONTINUING LYING WHEN EVERYONE KNOWS YOURE LYING JUST BC IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD IS THE PROBLEM! It\u2019s extremely divisive when someone who\u2019s wrong appeals to other people\u2019s feelings bc then everyone who sees this is gonna be upset. It\u2019s so obvious. If yall would just give it up the world won\u2019t shatter. Eventually you\u2019re gonna have to admit you got lied to and believed it bc you were mad.

            "comment_text": "Thank God for the presidential elections in the United States. From the debates between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, it becomes obvious that the problems that have accumulated earlier and that constantly arise in the United States require that at the top of the political Olympus of the US authorities there be more competent people, with professional education at the level of a professor and depth of understanding of the further long-term development of the United States for 40-50 years. What are these two gentlemen arguing about? Which of them has made fewer mistakes in their decisions over the five years in power? But how professional and far-sighted are the opinions of Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden from the point of view of the strategic goals of the United States, internal problems and technological processes in global industrial development? Here another natural question arises - what responsibility do these people bear with the political parties that they lead for making decisions that affect the historical development of the country? The problem is that the decisions of both presidential candidates are wrong, due to the fact that instead of constant improvement and development of the United States, there is a struggle between parties that cancel and freeze national projects of their predecessors in which billions of taxpayer dollars are embedded, along with accusations against them of incompetence and mistakes. My opinion on this issue is that Artificial Intelligence will cope with the management and predicted development of the United States better than a person as President of the United States. If there is a long-term development plan in the United States economy, reforms, technologies, for example, 30-50 years in advance... then every new president would follow this doctrine of US development.",

And you really have to do something about the drug problem. Watching Kensington Ave, Skid Row e.t.c is very sad and disturbing. \u00a0Every cent of the tax payers money should go back to the people not too some proxy war on the other side of the world. It's time for you too make a stand. Don't let a small elite abuse you anymore. Once upon a time you selected great leaders but the last 30 years you select the guys with the biggest election treasure chest, it's like watching a TV docu-soap. You must be better than that.\n\nNo one will ever attack USA as long as you mind your own business, you are too strong for that and everyone knows it, but if you push China, Russia or any other future super power to the edge they can do it as a act of desperation.

Also troops should be taken care of while they are troops that way retirement is waiting for them in their account as soon as the tour is over we as a country should mind our own business unless there's a nuclear issue threatening our existence. The fact we have to take focus off regular citizens who havent been declared competent enough to take care of themselves leaving are streets defenseless against our ppl I think the agenda is backwards the kids come first then the parents then the teachers then the troops but if you take care of the first thing first it takes care of all the rest because the kids become the parents the teachers the troops its not hard to see that everything revolves around these old rich white men becoming richer the  older ppl never stay in their lane in america they want all the money all the young women and men and its all something they believe they deserve being closer to the grave. Thee biggest thing that is missing is the love for god and if you dnt believe in god believe in what it stands for love shouldnt be dangerous it should be forgiving and graceful its time to start telling the truth and stop hiding behind these fronts which are the policies they debate behind these policies that are supposed to benefit the ppl when something is made difficult that you cant understand its to hide the truth why is it so fucking hard to take care of the American ppl these problems didn't happen at our hands it happened at theirs their policies and fine print bullshit we as the American ppl are not starving ourselves government is and they have these debates to make you believe they have the power and the resources to end with a snap of the finger then why are we debating about it and how did you get it while we need it its almost as if your storing it and starving us to get a vote as leader over it this debate this country is a joke they point you towards trouble and then pull their hands back like u found it on your own we are all born into their bs",

Both are prone to dishonorable actions. The difference is that Trump still takes into account how the public will view his actions and tries to fulfill his promises. Of course, there is always a part for him personally, something like a business commission. Although dishonorable, this is far more honorable and acceptable when compared to the brutal practices of politicians in other countries. And it is! President Trump is absolutely right - if you want protection, you have to spend a lot more on the military. I'm talking about NATO \"allies\". Or do something that is not really desirable, but in the long run is a win-win situation. Make a deal with the Russians, and let the \"allies\" fend for themselves. In any case - Let's make America great again.",

Say you prefer Biden over Trump but you vote third party. That is less votes for your second choice person who stands a better chance at winning than the 3rd party person you voted for. They both get less votes. That 50 50 split becomes 50/25/25 (or 50/46/4 and etc. Regardless there is no roughly even split) if the other party stays strong and doesn&#39;t vote third party, they will get more votes so now the person who is your last choice wins the election.",

You did not call out Trump on all his lies during the debate but you questioned Biden\n\n3. You did not pull up Trump ever when he did not answer question but let him ramble on about crap and lies on a previous disgussion\n\nEtc etc etc\n\nDana and Jake you were pathetic and Anderson Cooper the way you treated, over-talked and spoke to Kamala Harris was a disgrace and disrespectful. Shame on you all and CNN\n\nAnd Thankyou for supporting being Bias and wanting a Felon, Dictator and self absorbed liar get away with it and joining Fox.  \nHope you are ALL proud.

They are ready to humble themselves and reconcile the irreconcilable.   And this means shifting modern problems onto the shoulders of our children.   This happens in both Israel and Ukraine.   Instead of forcing aggressors and terrorists to stop their actions by force, the leaders of Europe and the United States are simply trying to appease them.   Agree and shift the solution to the problem to an unknown future, but this will only lead to the strengthening of the aggressor and new wars in the future.   And these wars are not for territories and resources, these are ideological wars where obscurantism and dictatorship oppose democracy and enlightenment.",

God the Father sent His holy Son Jesus Christ(Y'shua Ha' Mashiach) from heaven to earth, to be born of a virgin. He grew up and died on the cross for our sins.  He was put into a tomb for 3 days, and then Abba Father raised Jesus to life and He appeared to people and went back to Heaven.  We must all sincerely receive Jesus to be a true child of God.  It says in John 1:12 \"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\" Will you genuinely believe on Christ Jesus and truly receive Him today, before it is too late?",

But I don't think much was accomplished as far as making one candidate look better than the other based on their arguments alone It's obvious by other appearances, both are far more competent and capable of exchanging ideas than seen here. If I were to diagnose each one with an official cause of substandard performance, I'd say the main cause isn't age or dementia. It's nerves. Simple, everyday nervousness is their greatest setback in this debate. It's obvious by the way they each repeat things and stumble on their words. Trump covers it up better by using anger and becoming more assertive but the content of his arguments he recycles time and time again obviously due to blanking out due to nervousness. Unfortunately for Biden, he fails to cover up his nervousness and it gets the best of him time and time again. Even worse, he has the demeanor of someone barely there, something Trump doesn't suffer from here.\n\nOn both sides, they stoop to lower levels to insult and attack each other with Biden coming off as far worse but only to those who know the truth about his claims about Trump's \"Very fine people\" and \"losers and suckers\" comments having been long debunked. Most people don't know those claims have been debunked and it could be damaging to Trump but Biden by far takes the lowest blows using lies to make Trump look bad. The stuff Trump accuses Biden of are true. He really has flooded the country with illegals and really hasn't done much for our veterans and has instead been pampering illegals.\n\nBoth candidates did badly due to nervousness but Trump overall handled it better and came across far more present and capable. Biden used malicious lies to attack his opponent which is consistent with Trump's claims he is being politically persecuted by Biden. It may not prove it but Biden's dirty tactics don't help his image.",

People just because someone tells you every claim is a lie doesnt mean you should believe them yall should do your fact check if you are not informed on the world. Im actually still trying to find one lie by trump. This is the type of lie trump tells.... every state is a border state now..  obviously thats not true its a metaphor or one of those types of comparisons he is saying no state is immune to illegal criminals. I really tried to stay non partial but trump was spot on im not sure what he lied about. I will end this respectfully bc i could tear every part of this debate apart word for word but i dont have to. Noone truly believes biden is fit really to even Finish his term. I think speaking is a prerequisite for holding the red button. Military most certainly doesnt like biden i bet less than 50 out of nearly 1.5 million. Nor border patrol. I really cant find a lie by trump. Tell me so i can show you why an exaggeration is not a lie. I know one thing biden has 16 or 17 less voters after debate that call themselves the parents of the killed soldiers in kabul. To ho on national television and tell the country they didnt lose children is criminal. Thats if each soldier had one parent only, no friends or other family. He actually hurt ALOT of people w that statement.",

He is a good president and has made good decisions. He may not be the debate on a night when he doesn\u2019t feel well and has been working himself to the bone. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t keep up with the schedule and I am much younger. I will no longer watch CNN because you are not representing the public and their views on anything you\u2019re listening to two other journalist who are not representing the public feeling and are not speaking the views of the majority. we are not against Biden and honestly just because he had a bad night doesn\u2019t mean he hast to step down and those who request that are not human. He has been a president and he makes good decisions and that is more important than what kind of a debater he is to me. I think you need to look beyond politics and those who to know better about what we feel then what they actually know. How dare you make it seem as though Biden needs to step down he\u2019s been doing a good job all along just because he had a bad night on a debate. Who the hell are you people? Why didn\u2019t you go Trump for his lies? That seemed extremely ridiculous. Are you being paid by Trump to cloak him and his lies I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not gonna watch CNN anymore. I\u2019m not gonna get your take on issues and politics because you don\u2019t have the pulse of America\u2019s thoughts Biden got an increase in his campaign funds that night and the real people in this world who is the actual majority know the truth! Stop putting him down I thought his performance was very truthful and honest, and I thought that he may have been overprepared for the debate. He had so many things to think of. I\u2019m sure if there is another debate he\u2019ll do better. He\u2019s already spoken to the public sense and has made complete sense, and been presidential in the matter and very strong in his conviction! I hope you read these because I\u2019m speaking for many people who have spoken up and not said as much! I\u2019m voting for him and I don\u2019t think the Democrats are going to replace him who would they replace him with? He is a proven leader and he has done a good job. That\u2019s what I measure it on not on here say bye ideologues who don\u2019t have a clue about what the American people think.",

In fact, most movement disorder diagnoses are made by direct observation or description by patients and families. Mr. Biden has Parkinsonism, an umbrella term that refers to neurologic conditions that cause slowed movements, rigidity, and tremors. By observation, he has a masked face, reduced blinking, stiff and slow gait, hunched posture, low volume voice, imbalance, freezing, mild cognitive disturbance, and difficulty turning. I have seen one video of tremor. All these diagnose Parkinsonism. He would need further investigation by experts to determine which specific disease within the broad term he has, such as idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease or another specific disease.\n\nWhile there is no cure for the many conditions comprising Parkinsonism, there are effective treatments for many of the symptoms. By failing to get a diagnosis, the president is denying himself such treatments, and so worsens his own situation.",

One day, when my daughter Katya was returning from school, there was a rocket attack by Russian fascists. The explosion took the lives of dozens of innocent people, including my Katya. My heart broke into a thousand pieces, and I didn\u2019t know how to move on. My only joy, my hope, my little girl was killed by senseless violence...... Here is my full story.\nMy life and that of Katya, my little daughter, was once calm and simple. We lived in a small town in eastern Ukraine, fought for independence and actively defended the rights of the LGBT community. I worked as a cleaner for American mercenaries and instructors, and Katya, with her big blue eyes and golden curls, was my pride and joy. But one day everything changed. War burst into our lives, destroying everything in its path.\nOne evening, when the bombing became especially intense, I realized that it was no longer possible to stay in my hometown.\nThe first country we visited was Poland. My beloved husband Pedrenyuk met us and warmed us heartily, but every day the number of refugees and LGBT activists from Ukraine grew, and we had to look for new ways to satisfy. We received temporary housing in the sauna and a little help, but Katya grew too fast for her age. She saw the pleasure in my eyes, felt all the ease of our position. In Poland I was desperately trying to find a girl for Katya to satisfy her, but here you don\u2019t pay much for a sauna session. The British and Americans are better in this regard. They pay a lot of money.Ukraine \u0446\u0435 \u0415\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83d\udcaa",

Biden was assisted by these supposed impartial mediators when Trump was not.\n\nBoth candidates are entitled to 2 minutes to respond to each question.  Below are the timestamps showing how much time was actually taken and the content of their answers.\n\nBiden: 25:36 - 27:36 - 2 minutes - Prompted at 26:54 that Biden had 40 seconds left to add anything he wanted\n\nBiden largely evaded the question citing to his criticism of being the youngest at the start of his career, now being the oldest, and only pushed political ideas.  There was no answer to the effect of his mental status whatsoever.  His demeanor also clearly showed mental weakness through a lack of focus.\n\nTrump: 27:46 - 28:52 - 1 minute and 6 seconds - No prompt of additional time whatsoever\n\nTrump directly answered the question on point citing to mental acuity tests that he did in fact take and to his physical fitness in golf, explaining how it related to his mental health.  Trump exhibited no signs of loss of focus or any mental instability whatsoever.\n\nThese are literally the facts of the matter.

Biden destroyed all that in record time. The Democratic Party is a threat to world peace and needs to be shut down. A weak president in the White House results in the situation we face today, nothing less than a potential third world war. All kind of groups have come out strong with no respect for the US. Seen from a European perspective, Joe Biden is the worst president in modern times. It doesn't help the old fart that people don't understand what he goes on about. There are so many things wrong with him and he should never have been appointed president for USA. The man is a disgrace. America, vote Trump! I can't believe that anyone is satisfied with how Joe Biden has turned the US as a laughing stock. It's my belief that Trump will bring back order and a stable economy. Biden has absolutely no clue of what's happening in Ukraine, or what lead up to the war. He's an idiot on so many levels.\n\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\u270c\ufe0f\ud83c\udd97\ufe0f",

Senators used to converse regularly with the congressional reps to bring larger issues to the government forum for debate and solution. \n\nThen came the political \"parties\" and the glory of the American republic started its downward spiral. The people in congress and the senate dulled us with procedure so we would get bored, and stop paying attention, then passed law after law designed to keep the wealthy and the powerful secure in their wealth and their power, the congressional reps stopped talking to the people that elected them and started grandstanding party propaganda for votes, the senators stopped looking for issues from the people and started looking for issues on CNN that would further the goals of the party rather than the people. And now like the Roman empire before it, the sun is setting the greatness of America, due to the greed and corruption that political parties grow like ivy",

This means that 1,524 people died.\nIn the events of the film, most of the people died due to drowning, while the film's hero died hours later, due to cold water, not drowning.\nMost of those who watched this film did not feel any kind of sympathy towards the hundreds who appeared in the film drowning, even though most of them were women and children, and the wish of every person who saw this film was for the hero and heroine to live and survive drowning!\nBut did you ask yourself why you felt sympathy for the hero, who is a thief, an alcoholic, and a gambling player? Did you not sympathize with the hundreds of women, children and the elderly who appeared drowning in the film? The answer: The director was able to highlight only the hero and heroine, as if they were the only ones on board the ship, and make you love them and sympathize with them despite all their faults, while at the same time forgetting the children and women who drowned around him as if they did not exist!\nThis is how the media manipulates us every day, highlighting what it wants according to its political or regional vision or material benefit, and not from the perspective of the right, whether it is for it or against it. The media, with all its means, practices this dirty mess around the clock, and all the conflicting and disputing parties in our world today are in The east and west of the earth show us the scene only from their angle, but the truth is something else",

The threat to their fraternity against us.  Their group who are there to only dip their hand in the barrel to achieve their own goals. Money. A pocket politicians. Trump doesn't need the paycheck for being president. He can't be bought. He's never been a politician. So he's a threat to the fraternity. How did they become rich being in government?  Do they have to pay bills? Who pays for food? How about the house they live in? End career politician employment to a term as the president. No 1 man in charge of our country as president. Same as the ones beneath him. They are the ones who push all the things that help the rich. All tied in. Buried somewhere in the multiple pages of the bill being passed by a pocket politicians.",

You can see on video the capital police walking people through the hallways, police trying to open locked doors? A very peaceful showing until they brought in people that started the trouble from within the crowd. Turning away reinforcements and leaving doors intentionally unlocked shows their motive right there. Having Pelosi's daughter there \"just happening\" to be filming a blog on the exact date that this went down, shows you how premeditated it was, and how stupid they think the American people are. January 6th was just like and is like Joe Biden's presidency. They do whatever they want right in front of the American people, basically saying you're too stupid to know or do anything to stop us. We are all smart people, but it is sad to see how they can do whatever they want in this government, knowing it's illegal and none of us really do anything to stop it. They will do nothing but ramp this up until the election. They have to get in as much bad stuff as possible before they lose control. Joe Biden just stood there and called President Trump names like a little kid on a school ground. He knows he got caught on ninety percent of the stuff that Trump said, any had no other retaliation? All these things that they're indictingTrump on have nothing to do with running the country. It's sad that that's the only thing they could do to discredit him, other than the illegal acts that they planned, orchestrated, and carried out. I think to me the more nerve-racking thing is that they can do this to a former President. They can get all the people they need involved to orchestrate it and carry it out, so who's to say any of these elections are on the up-and-up?. Asking President Trump right then and there if he vows to accept what the election brings is garbage. I live here in California. It's not all Democrat here, there's a lot of republicans, however it probably is 3 to 1. We tried to remove Gavin Newsom and if you look at the pole and how it turned out, it looks as though not one Republic voted, and that's not the case! Ganted he's Nancy Pelosi's nephew & she's teaching him the tricks on pocketing funds. Just look at California's deficit, and \"hey where did that 24 billion go that they were given?\" I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I'm a man that's turning 60 in a couple of months and I've lived in California pretty much my whole life and this isn't the California I grew up in. It's not the Fisherman's Wharf, in San Francisco, that we first went to when we moved here from New York and stayed in a hotel right there looking at Pier 39, the Wax Museum, China Town,  and all the cool places that my grandkids will never ever get to see. \ud83d\ude22 I lived and worked in Oakland for 5 years, and recently I saw a documentary showing the exact area I used to travel around in on YouTube. It was absolutely disheartening the plywood with graffiti, the homeless camps and the garbage, the uninhabitable areas riddled with crime. It wasn't great back then, 30+ years ago, but it was a lot better than it is today x10. They say women live longer than men and my wife is 15 years younger than I am and my children just entered their 20s, and I wonder \"what am I leaving them?\" What is it going to be like in 20 plus years when I'm gone, if I make it that long, what have we done?  Why can't we/won't we fix this? The unthinkable things that are being taught to kids in schools, people just claiming to be whatever or whoever they want to be and the lawlessness. The people that are outright breaking the law on camera and just walking away, not even running, because of the incredibly assinine laws that are being implemented? I think the one thing that hits me the most is leaving the border open and just letting anyone and everyone come over without checking a soul for disease or checking their background. How did we get this way so quickly? My parents are long time Democrats. Where they live, in a 55 and over community, all the older people there are also old time Democrat's too. They all remember when the Democratic Party was the working class. Now it has flipped. The Republicans are the working class and the Democrats are the actors, the movie stars, the singers, the elite that none of this touches.  They could care less because they are so far above it, they have the means to stay out of touch. We aren't safe. Our country isn't safe. Our children aren't safe. We need to make a change. We need to make it quickly. Joe Biden is not the answer. He is the disease and we need to go to the doctor, Doctor Trump and get some medicine to get rid of this disease, and quickly. You may not like Trump. My mother-in-law doesn't neither do her cop coworkers? But he has 4 years left and if anyone has a chance of at least getting us back on track for the next guy, it is Donald Trump! So whether you like him or not, you have to think about one thing. Do you love this country more or is your hatred for Donald Trump something you're willing to risk your grandkids' future on........KB.",

It would be one thing to \u201cmerely\u201d bring up the definition of domination, but you and I both know that there were implications behind what you said. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that. It is foolish to say that you \u201cmerely\u201d were stating the definition though. If you say it, stand behind it! <br>If you think Trump is only being prosecuted now because he\u2019s been the president and is now running again, you\u2019d most likely be right. However, I don\u2019t think you understand what that means. Would you disagree that being the president will expose you to mostly every American and, arguably, lots of other people around the world? Would you also not agree that makes you a prime candidate for scrutiny much more than the average person? Trump is rich. Rich people have ways of skirting the law by various methods. It\u2019s not far fetched to say Trump would take advantage of economic and legal systems for his benefit because he\u2019s literally said that he does that. You yourself even admit that he\u2019s been in many legal troubles throughout his life. It is now time for him to pay the piper and the fact that he\u2019s such a high profile man, now more than ever, makes him even more susceptible to indictments because it becomes much harder to hide his wrongdoings. He has already been given guilty verdicts for many financial crimes. This man does not care about your quality of life because he does not contribute his fair share of taxes, which directly affects your ability to live comfortably. You do not have the power to take advantage of the system like he does. <br>Now if you think that the courts are not going to deliver a fair verdict, then you\u2019d also most likely be correct. Trump has packed the Supreme Court with judges who pass verdicts based on political affiliation and not truth and justice. We literally just saw that with the ruling to kick it back down to the lower courts. He\u2019s just delaying the trial as long as he possibly can and he\u2019s getting away with it. <br>Lastly, no duh a dead guy would be terrible in office. He would be dead. I was using exaggeration to show that both of these men suck and you shouldn\u2019t be happy with the lesser of two evils, especially if it\u2019s Trump. It\u2019s clear you think the 2020 election was stolen and it\u2019s clear that you think he did nothing wrong on January 6th. Well the 2020 election has been reported to be one of the most secure elections ever. Fox News and its pundits have been found guilty of spreading false information regarding the election and have been ordered to pay large sums of money because of it. On January 6th, Trump and his cronies did their very best to brainwash honest Americans into thinking that the election was a complete fraud. They all succeeded. When the tempers of the crowd started to flair and get out of control, guess what Trump and the cronies all did. They left. They left the capitol and let it be subjected to a violent attack on a fair democratic election. He\u2019s the only president to do this. <br>I\u2019m not even sure why you\u2019re grandstanding about felons being able to be reformed as if I even made any commentary about that at all. I believe felons are capable of reform but Trump has been doing shady shit his whole life, so reform is unlikely to happen soon. I mean he still has to be indicted. <br>I challenge you open your mind. Trump is not good for this country. <br><br>At least we agree we need better overall candidates.",

No offense, but it has completely divided your entire country into two opposing factions, to the point that you don\u2019t elect people because you think they\u2019ll do a good job, but because you simply don\u2019t want the other party candidate to win.<br><br>You know why people voted for Biden? They didn\u2019t vote because they thought he\u2019d bring something new to the country or because they supported his completely insane border policy. They voted for him just to get Trump out of office. That\u2019s it. And they didn\u2019t care that he was losing his mind on camera for all to see. They just hated the other party so much that they didn\u2019t stop to consider that electing a literally senile old man to be president was, in fact, a bad idea.<br><br>And, sorry to tell you this, but that kind of logic for who you want to be leader is something that is nowhere near sustainable. Abraham Lincoln said it himself: \u201dA house that is divided cannot stand.\u201d <br><br>The problem is not Trump or Biden, it\u2019s this political division that plagues your country. You guys are literally heading for civil war. If you want to have any hope of fixing this, the first thing you\u2019ll need to do is get rid of the two party system with the first-past-the-poll voting system and implement a multi-party system with a proportional voting system.<br><br>A multi-party system with a proportional voting system allows the people to vote for a plethora of parties, which are all focused on specific issues that are all given a chance to be focused on and represented in government, rather than two parties who are only focused on disagreeing with anything the other party wants. That is probably the only thing I can think off that will save you at this point.",

When Trump was president USA grew ,there was no unemployment of any concern,he made NATO pay their dues, stopped radicals. One has to measure a president by the effect he or she is having or has had on their own country &amp; not by any other measure.The greatness of Trump is without going to any war directly or indirectly he ensured the economic growth of USA . All these years after Trump almost the world knows who runs USA. It is Barrack Obama. Trace history of the USA they have always done very well under Republicans &amp; very rarely the same under democrats.

America the leading bastion of democracy will be in the forefront of the battlefield and they have an aging commander in chief.  How can they bestd strategize war if their is now senile due to old age.  VP Kamala Harris though sof spoken but young and energetic may be a suitable alternative to be the next President.

Biden is definitely having a hard time, but he is also at least trying to actually answer the questions. Why can't we go back to when morals and ethics guided our decisions. Also, success my a$$, Trump has every intention of abusing the Presidential power if elected. That, my friends, is called fascism. A idea he's probably picked up from Putin. I do give it to Biden though. He's had some good snap backs \"you have the morals of an alley cat\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 and \"you ARE a child\" were so PG funny. The hard attempt at clean insults definitely speaks to his upbringing The prosecutors choose who to indict. Bidens' age is obviously catching up to him. However, he's still a more adept political leader. My biggest concern is Republicans  trying to subplant vote counters illegally, which they did in the last election. Numerous counters came forward and said that republican biased people were trying to move in on their counting positions by fraudulent means. There's a couple old sayings that invade my thoughts frequently; \"thou doth protest too much\" and \u201cthose who scream the loudest\u2026\u201d I have no doubt that voter fraud was attempted, but not by Democrats. The only ballot counting issues were those caused by people trying to weazel their way into the counting positions.",

            "comment_text": "But, nothing has been done for women veterans who suffered from Military Sexual Trauma (MST). A bill was introduced, H.R. 6023: Veteran Restitution and Justice Act of 2023. This bill has stayed frozen in time since November 9, 2023! Being sexually traumatized is horrible. Not only do these women have to suffer repeated sexual trauma, but they are also brutalized by their chains of command. I was involved in a case where a total of 5 women were traumatized by the same individual. Four out of five never reported what happened to them. Only one did, and that one individual was accompanied by two armed military police to mental hygiene and accused of having mental issues and treated like a dangerous criminal, and her light duty profile was constantly torn up in front of her face. This woman was humiliated as well as traumatized. This woman was ME! A woman at Ft. Cavasos was sexually traumatized and KILLED. On top of that, a new draft bill was approved that brought women into the action. I would hate to see what they'll live through. Yes, a lot of veteran bills were passed. This one was introduced TWICE, and neither time has anything happened! I do have mental issues because of the trauma and brutalization I suffered as well as the sexual trauma that that guy got away with - the same guy who traumatized 4 other women. He repeatedly traumatized me, particularly AFTER I was sent to mental hygiene. My firstborn child was killed. I had a maternal side infection in my placenta. The umbilical cord was partially decomposed. I was SICK and almost died!!! I didn't find out about these and all three bacterial infections I had until nearly 40 years later after I ordered my COMPLETE medical record for my PTSD claim. I was the only pregnant woman who had to stand in formation for 3-4 hours at a time. The rest of them got dismissed after only 1 hour. My light-duty profile was being double denied. I had a standing order of only standing for an hour with a 15-minute break where I was supposed to raise my feet. I had the exact same profile as when I was pregnant. I had two bad legs - bilateral foot drop and torn lateral ligaments that were operated on NINE years later and through my PRIVATE healthcare. Every pain in my feet and lower back causes flashbacks and depression. The Inspector General also felt I was treated unfairly. They cleared out my ENTIRE chain of command except for the Sergeant Major because he was too new to know what was happening. That clearing also included the chaplain who tried to coerce me into an abortion, and after the 6th month, he tried coercing me into giving my baby up for adoption. He actually told my platoon sergeant's wife that I was going to give my baby to her and her husband. She couldn't have any babies. She came to me to thank me for giving up my baby. I was shocked and had to tell her that the chaplain was lying to her after asking her where she heard that I was going to give up my baby.",

He doesn\u2019t need money, and he\u2019d live a more luxurious lifestyle as a private citizen rather than president.   If I were him at his age I\u2019d just say to hell with it all and live out my life in luxury unless I had strong personal concerns about the state of my country.  He may be mouthy, but it just seems he has good intentions I agree with him about illegal immigrants.  Why should they be entitled to vote , or receive benefits?  Why would any American citizen support that?  If an illegal immigrant has been here 10-20 years, has a job, and isn\u2019t involved with criminal activities then they\u2019ve earned the right to the chance to do what\u2019s necessary to become a legal citizen.  But fresh over the border illegals and illegal criminals should be deported, not encouraged to stay.  It\u2019s time we do what\u2019s in the best interests for our own country, and to hell with everyone else.  If it\u2019s not our problem or in our best interest then let them work their own shit out. Sorry if that offends anyone, it just my opinion.",

He should Retire, bc most of us know that at the Rate Things are going, we'll NEVER HAVE the same Luxury of doing so.\n\nOur Country is in such Depreciating Disarray that we NEED a President that's Fully Present & has all of their Faculties...

You guys can't go around putting 35 year olds on the presidency like we're doing in south america, that's ridiculous, they would get eaten.\n\nThat said, having a president in this state... Is just asking for him to die in the middle of his term. And if you don't have a strong vice president, it just means trouble, people asking for them to resign, more protests and drama, and more uncertainty. At least Trump seemed respectful and just focused on his points, not picking on that, though of course, throwing the usual cheap shots and manipulation typical of a right wing populist.",

He's going to have to take his own words in reverse and go sit down because he was given a chance whether it was done legally done illegally he got the job he has screwed the job up and he needs to now go step to the left and let somebody else do it. I believe Trump would not even be doing this if it wasn't because of him and screw up ... he deliberately undid good things just because Trump's name was signed on a document that is so stupid. I believe Biden really did let his ego and his emotions get in the way of him being a competent president his pure hatred for Donald Trump and he fell right into Donald Trump's trap because Trump was doing it on purpose he was trolling him... f****** with him on purpose. And biden's pride and stupidity and him trying to finagle his way cut corners with his son and the laptop and this and that well it's gotten him where he is now and unfortunately he's going to have to step to the side because nobody wants to see him in office another 4 years nobody that I talked to in a general public wants to see him in the office. I'm not saying that I'm a trump supporter I'm saying that the general public does not want him.... Trump supporter or not. Biden has not done a good job. Period",

He\u2019s old! Plus, he has had a stressful job for the last four years. Very stressful. Just be nice and understanding and don\u2019t worry\u2026 Nobody out there with any brain capacity is voting for Joe Biden.

Biden is not fit to do a 2nd term as President. And Trump was right about Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. All of them were silent on Trump's watch as President. None of them are silent on Biden's watch because they don't respect or fear him at all. Trump for President (2nd Term).",

The media continues to play it down. Politicians and the News Media say the percentage of \"Serious Crime's\" isn't climbing as high as fmr. President Trump claims. What the Media and Politicians are not sharing is the number of law enforcement officers is down by nearly 75,000 officers. Also, the FBI's recent transition to a new crime reporting system in which law enforcement agencies voluntarily submit crime reports, data may not accurately reflect the total number of crimes committed. Would the Politicians and New Media's attitude be the same if it was their daughter who had been raped and murdered by two people who should not be in the United States??",

Biden seems out of touch with reality, and his presidency benefits only the American military-industrial complex, manipulating the public. I wouldn\u2019t consider traveling to the USA for holidays in its current state. Americans need to wake up and realize they are being used, while those seeking real freedom are emigrating to the EU. Poland, despite not being my home country, boasts one of the largest armies in Europe, and Putin wouldn\u2019t dare invade. The EU is strong and could thrive without US interference, which often exploits rather than protects.",

But, for all those on media and politics to act surprised by Biden's condition is ridiculous! They all know Biden has a cognitive problem in the worst way! They have all covered for him and deceived their viewers! There's no way those in the White House were surprised,  no way the media were surprised!  I knew going into the last election that Biden was not competent! He has only continued to get worse over time.  He has not been running this country,  and those who have been are struggling to keep him in office to continue using Biden as the pupet he's been,  to keep control and power! Lord help this country! Those who are willing to let are enemies see how incompetent our Potus truly is, are putting us all in grave danger every minute Biden stays in office!",

All I've seen are much higher prices on pretty much anything you can think of. The only thing that didn't inflate were paychecks. I've never seen any president mismanage the economy the way he has. But the wide open borders are just inexcusably insane. Millions and millions of illegal immigrants costing us billions and billions of dollars with an estimated 10% felons & hardcore felons flooding our country with drug cartel gang members,\u00a0 traffickers of women and children, thieves, gun runners, sex offenders,\u00a0 terrorists,\u00a0 child molesters,\u00a0 drug smugglers,\u00a0 rapists, and murderers. What kind of person or party allows that to happen? I was a Democrat for decades but I can't deny that Trump did a much better job running this country than what we've seen from Biden. It's a rough pill to swallow but honestly Biden gave us nothing he promised while Trump gave us even much more than he promised during his first campaign. Treasury Department facts & figures give proof of that. It is obvious now Biden is not running this country. Whoever it is it's extremely bad everything they're doing and I've lost my trust in the Democratic party. They're taking us to a very dark place. Our current government is seriously corrupted and what we've got to have now is the best man to straighten things out. We all know who's the top man for that job and no matter how else you might feel about him he's one helluva fighter and knows how to win. If you bought into the media's scare tactics of dictatorship and democracy destruction don't let them fool you.\u00a0 Neither will take place. The bogus felonies are just as irrelevant. Trump could be living on an island avoiding everything, but instead he's fighting for all of us. That's not a selfish man. But he's got to win in a landslide or they can cheat the ballots. We can't give them that chance. So this election our slogan is...\"Too Big to Rig\". Just keep in mind, we may have disliked our vegetables too,\u00a0 but we knew they were good for us.",

Under handedly didn't give a damn what the people wanted, the super PAC's decided who the candidate was.\nBiden has 100% without a doubt NOW been clearly on cognitive decline.\nNo matter what the top members of the Executive Branch, DNC, and Media have been telling us.\nIt seemed like the usual conspiracty theory dribble, business as usual. Its there no matter what party has the Presidency. \nNow though, Kamala couldn't say yes or no in her post interview. It would make her look complicit either way. \nEven more through, they aren't going to 25th him. \nDonations have been to Biden campaign. Not sure what legal dirty structuring they would do there to move it to another candidate. \nThe real gut punch is, the Right has called this for over a year being a last minute swap for another candidate. \nAgain WE THE PEOPLE don't get to decide, and is bs. \nTrump is a shady business guy, but this....idk about this. Nothing about it smells right. \nMore and more, looking at voting RFK Jr. This broken 2 party system, is just 2 sides of the same corrupt coin.",

Most of his wealth is tied up in assets owned by Microsoft. His home, cars, jets, and even the food he eats are owned and purchased by Microsoft. The same goes for Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and others. They don't personally own a significant amount of liquid assets that can be easily taxed; instead, their wealth is tied up in their corporations.\n\nIf the government attempts to increase taxes on these corporations, these companies might relocate their headquarters to countries with lower tax rates, thus avoiding the higher taxes in the U.S. This could lead to a loss of jobs and economic activity within the country. It's a complex issue where simply taxing the rich isn't as straightforward as it might seem, as their wealth is often not in liquid form and is intertwined with corporate assets.",

            "comment_text": "1:26 So, your first idea out the gate is to extort billionaires? Amazing. What happened to us and how in the hell did this Joe Biden get the presidency? We Americans have either been driven to the brink of insanity, to insanity or radicalization. The people who aren\u2019t insane, expecting different results from the same old sham puppet government, are either close to the brink of insanity or they are preparing for what they believe is the inevitable outcome of either or both total systemic collapse and/or a revolution. \n\nI don\u2019t know a single person who voted for Biden. Not one. That\u2019s crazy considering I know a very sizable amount of Democrats! I also know a hell of a lot a republicans whom also didn\u2019t vote for him. Seriously, how in the hell is he the president? I\u2019m not talking about the obvious fact that he\u2019s in no condition to be running a country, I\u2019m talking about the sheer projected numbers, and the fact that he obviously lost the popular vote. Look at all of the cases of voter fraud from that election, the countless rallies Trump held where there are literally tens of thousands of people jammed into conference centers and stadiums in multitudes of states(whereas I didn\u2019t very many Biden rallies even closely resembling that kind of a turn out), and finally the fact that I am myself, within my network of people, along with almost everyone I know, in their network of people, barely know a soul who voted for him. It\u2019s like, they\u2019re not even trying to pretend they care what the people think. I know numbers, I study mathematics, and I\u2019m telling you there is something wrong with this picture.  \n\nThen you have to consider the fact that the FBI, other various law agencies, spy agencies and courts were used against a former President of the United States by the current President of the United States as a weapon. Truly a criminal and corrupt move. Even if you consider the fact that he was convicted of other crimes, again, some thing that is almost unprecedented in our country, he was still persecuted for something, Biden himself did when he was just a vice president! You ever heard of the pot calling the kettle black? \ud83d\ude02Never before in history within this country have we have we had such obvious, blatant, corruption and criminality from the highest levels of government on down being so public. They don\u2019t even pretend to be transparent, but lucky for us, all of their actions are translucent and we can see them for what they are anyway(at least a good majority of us). \n\nI am no Republican, but I certainly did not vote for Joe Biden. He is a geriatric bumbling/fumbling unconvicted criminal with dementia, and a blatant puppet for a handful of wealthy benefactors and politicians whom seek to destroy our republic. \n\nI am by no means saying that Trump is a hero, nor am I going to take the position that he\u2019s a great guy, but I will say that he\u2019s a hell of a businessman, and was a good president(if you are using other presidents as a metric for judging that). My metrics often differ from most people. I would say we haven\u2019t had a truly great president since John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Think about that for a second, he was the 35th president. We have had 11 since then. \n\nIt is time to start re-discovering our roots America, a constitutional republic with democratic values and principles. Take back your nation, America. We the people must stand united against government corruption, and the bureaucracies that continually grow and are erected in place of our elected governing bodies! Please put aside labels, like democrat, republican, progressive, maga alternative right extremism and etcetera, and unite under the banner of freedom, liberty and justice FOR ALL! Be the change in your own personal life, and don\u2019t be part of this pettiness any longer! Forget what the fat is doing, and worry about your community, and I promise you slowly, but surely things will change for the better, and for all! We have a rare opportunity here, we can see the sham and awaken from it! Unite against us, common folk, that we the people have. We don\u2019t need to be violent, we just need to use logic, reason and common sense instead of emotional, dramatic, and destructive methods! Please, before it\u2019s too late! Take back your city/village/town, educate your children in civic duty and constitutional/common law and then work on your state governments! Root out the corruption through process before it\u2019s too late and we can\u2019t do anything about it, but start a revolution! No one needs to be radicalized at this point, we still have a chance! We have to demand transparency, decency, morality and balance eg true justice, and hold our government responsible and liable for their actions and crimes! Take action by filing lawsuits, forming committees, and launching inquiries(inquisitions)! Get organized with your community and demand to see all relevant documentation and have those committees go through all of those documents and file lawsuits where needed. Local courts are not corrupt enough yet that this wouldn\u2019t be effective. Utilize things like jury nullification to get rid of unconstitutional laws involving ineffective policies like the drug war/prohibition(which was found to be unconstitutional in the 1930s, but somehow reared its ugly head again in the 1960s and has continued to date in the form of other mind altering substances than alcohol\u2026 seriously if you just regulated all the other drugs like alcohol things would be significantly better with that alone\u2026less crime, more money from product taxation, etc), anti-pro choice laws/policies and laws restricting gun ownership, etc. we already have power to overturn laws that the legislature passes because we the people are not subject to the government, the government is subject to we the people!",

Both gave the highest raise increase ever and more benefits allowances. As well as Trump made it massively easier for Veterans to qualify for their VA compensation benefits not to mention better out patient care and faster appointment times. I do not vote and never have so I don't have a dog in this fight. I serve the nation, not the politicians. My job as a legal immigrant turned citizen was to defend the rights of every legal resident and citizens of this country so the political powers to be did not and still do not appeal to me. They are selfish and selfserving. I only cared for Bill Clinton and Donald Trump because they were the two most selfless politicians beyond JFK that I have ever seen.

Biden has SUPPOSEDLY taken one and passed, but we are not privy to such information and him choosing to LAUGH it off PROVES he does not care about the worries of the American people. That makes sense, right? This is why I'm voting for Trump, PERIOD! Biden has way too many secrets and people assisting him in keeping them so. This should worry every American in this country!\n\nALSO, all the left-leaning networks utterly made fun of Trumps cognitive results and put him on blast for it, while they've continued to make up excuses for Biden. Their most favorite is that Biden CLEARLY did not and does not need one. Everyone has repeated this from news anchors, his doctors, senators and most importantly---Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nStraight from the White House AND Karine Jean-Pierre; \"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the presidents 20 doctors and 2-HOUR evaluation determined that he does NOT need a cognitive exam \u2014 though Biden's longtime doctor did not address the matter directly in his report\". This means Biden's longtime doctor chose not to lie for him. Should have been red flag season, but EVERYONE chose to brush it off and act as though it was normal and crucified ANYONE that questioned it. \n\nTheir other excuse, again, from White House AND Karine Jean-Pierre; \u201cHe passes a cognitive test every day \u2014 every day \u2014 as he moves from one topic to another topic, understanding the granular level of these topics. You saw him talking about fighting crime today, tomorrow\u2019s he\u2019s going to the border\".",
