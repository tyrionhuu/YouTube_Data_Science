What will the originalist Supreme Court think about this issue?\n\nWhile each state may have slightly different penalties, there are some common rights that are almost always taken away. In California, convicted felons will lose the following rights:\nVoting rights, Ability to travel abroad, Gun ownership, Jury service, Employment in certain fields, Public assistance and housing, Parental rights. \n\nNo one should be above the law, not even Trump. Even if the constitution does not ban convicted felons from becoming president, with all the principles in the constitution and our laws, the only conclusion that follows is that convicted felons are banned from becoming presidents.

Even though it will be a hard road regardless; a gentle pace, makes the work easy.\n\nMany say now that it is not as dark as it was, during years before; because many deaths are not occurring;\n\nBut the amount of unforgiveness, is higher now, than it has been before, and the loss of life, is a small result; which will come, compared to the other consequences, the world is facing now\n\nLeave stories like this alone, storms like this will come, and they will come again, but take each day, one step at a time, and you will have heard the reason, the son of man was willing to die,\n\nSo many may find life, even beyond death,\n\nThe way, the truth and the light-\nThe bread of life,\nThe home of love,\nThe joy of a child,\nThe language of the eternal nation,\nThe written words, which shall not pass away\nThe building blocks which one may use to unlock the doors, where anything is possible\nThe blood of the lamb\n\nJohn 1:1-5\nGenesis 1-3\nGenesis 9:8-16\nExodus20:1-17\nMatthew 1\nMatthew 4\nMatthew 5-7\nMatthew 9:10-17\nMark12:41-44\nLuke 7:40-50\nMatthew 13\nMatthew 19\nMatthew 22:23-46\nMatthew 23-25\nMatthew 28:16-20\nLuke 10:17-42\nLuke 23:6-12\nJohn 7:53-8:11\nJohn 8:48-59\nJohn 13-17\nJohn 3\nRevelations 11\nRevelations 16 \n\nDon\u2019t let the apathy of the world cause you to loose hope.

Like I said a cop can\u2019t get his job back in Law Enforcement if convicted of a Felony so how does a Ex President have that privilege. A convicted Felon has NO Rights by Law so Trump does???

By the way, if the Judge sentences Trump to jail, his numbers will sky rocket in popularity. See, I play Baldur's Gate, and in a part of the game I had to fight this monster and every time I damaged it, it got stronger. Anything the socialist democrats do to Trump, he only gets stronger. One more thing, I keep seeing these \"34 counts\" postings, it was 1 count broken up into 34 counts. It's like if you and a friend were smoking a joint and passed it back and forth 20 times and the D.A. charged you with 20 counts of distribution of narcotics.",

Ofcourse Trump has done many criminal offences (which previous president hasnt and i am not condoning any of them). But the most important thing the left has to remember is that this is the man almost half of the country voted for in the previous two election cycles. Celebrating justice is well and fine, but people on the other end are pissed, and as a matter of fact categorising them as dumb and stupid will not take you far as Kimmel often does. People have legitimate interests and one has to recognise and discuss them. If 90% (except for Fox and others) of mainstream media is not able to understand what half of the Americans say, then there is something seriously wrong. It begs the question whether they are in their own bubble. This just increases the polarisation. I am not an American citizen but i admire it in many ways. Hopefully it can sort itself out, the world really needs a counterbalance to China.",

            "comment_text": "I explained over four years ago, D. Trump was the LAST TRUMP of God, the warning that everyone needs to get their HEART right with God or go down with him and Biden who is bidin his time, so the people can RETURN to the truth and be set free:\n\nChristianity missed it too:  WHY? Because like Judaism who missed it FIRST, they teach by the carnal mind, the ENEMY of God, the seed of the serpent the false prophet:  ALL RELIGIONS teach by this method which is why the HEART remains the beast that goes through all Kingdoms and nations without being TRANSFORMED into \"MAN\" in Gods image and likeness: That MAN is Jesus. God FORMS HIMSELF into MAN (Jesus) within our heart, the full stature of the INNER MAN of our heart.  Christians don't teach this: \r\n\r\nAdam is Messiah: He is the first (Adam in whom we died) and he will be the LAST ADAM in whom we are made alive when Adam becomes Messiah as planned before the foundation of the world:  God didn't change his mind:  Adam's son is the BORN AGAIN Adam, the Last Adam, the \"Son of Man\" and we are all members of his body: \r\n\r\nWe all become the LIVING STONES built upon the cornerstone (Christ, ANOINTING, the YACHIDA/only Son) so the HOUSE (Temple) never falls again:  The living stones, the Holy and Royal priesthood (David and Aaron) are the way God (Hashem) builds his final temple, the Tabernacle of David, a house of prayer for allllllll nations: \r\n\r\nPeoples egos will all fall because the ego is \"GOG of Magog\" the mountain of the mountains that will all be laid low by God WHEN Messiah the ANOINTING RISES within us, bringing Adam (Son of Man) to life along with Moses, Elijah, the prophets, EVERYONE:  God will SUDDENLY rise in his temple, his stony hearted people, and in an instant, he will destroy their vessel of vanity, their EGO, and win the war of Gog and Magog. \r\n\r\nSo where do the Jews fit in?  The Jew is the circumcised heart of Adam (EVE) in whom we died hence the heart is wicked above all things;  And when this heart gives BIRTH to the Messiah (anointing) because he is not a physical man but Gods IMAGE AND LIKENESS hence a LIFE GIVING SPIRITUAL MAN, (VOV in YHVH) who is born through the heart, to reveal the abomination of desolation in the heart (Holy Place) where it ought not be (Mathew 24) and once the abomination of DESOLATION in the heart is revealed, the ANOINTING destroys it (Dan 9) because there is enough OIL to cleanse the inner court or Holy Place (Hanukkah);\r\n\r\nSo Eve the heart becomes the MOTHER OF ALL LIVING when the HEART is circumcised by the Messiah who also gives life to her husband the carnal mind because this is Adam's curse, since Adam is the mind that fell to bring nothing good from the earth.   The serpent was CREATED CROOKED by God and is Adam's will and the crooked is made STRAIGHT by the MESSIAH or the OIL because it LIFTS THE SERPENT UP (here is the resurrection of all three, Adam, Eve, the serpent) a three fold chord that will not be easily broken again. \r\n\r\nIF ADAM does not find the ANOINTING within himself through all his members, the STONY HEARTS (Israel) from the good ground (Mark 4, John 16) which is Judah who took a vow to bring the ANOINTING the GOOD ROOT of Adam to the world, (Nahum 1:15) then there will be a dead Adam just recycling through dust dust dust because the dust is the serpents meat all its life.  TO overcome hell death and the grave, Adam , Eve and the serpent have to RISE ABOVE THE DUST and it is through the ANOINTING, through the Messiah:  \r\n\r\nIf I had not experienced this I would not know it was true: BUT since I did on the Jewish feast days of 1992, I know its true:\r\n\r\n ignored for 31 years only proves that NOBODY wants to hear or see Messiah because he ruins the party of SELF, of the vessel of vanity that has its own ideas about how things will go through politics and religion that just keep making everything and I mean EVERYTHING worse every day, every minute:  The CROOKED SERPENT Yetzer hora, lashon hora, does not love you:  Hashem loves you but the serpent does not LOVE HASHEM:  Do not kid yourself that he loves him.  He may not be able to do anything outside of Hashem's WILL, but Hashem has given him free reign over you till you DO TESHUVAH (repent back to the GOOD ROOT of Adam, the Messiah:  If you can't see his free reign as all the problems in the world, then you can stay in exile with him.  Hashem will allow it till he destroys him along with all the people who prefer him.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe carnal cursed mind, (seed of the serpent and false prophet) just SPINS TALES and more tales and never comes to the KNOWLEDGE (da'at) of the truth because it can not know the truth or God or the things of God, and yet the world goes after him and all his nonsense and there is no one (well I am here but there is no EAR to hear me):  No one else can explain HOW TO REPENT and where the MESSIAH ARISE FROM, within us because Messiah went into exile with Adam as a SEED but he won't rise till we deny the YETZER HORA, and till we do TESHUVAH (REPENT) back to the GOOD ROOT that is within us, but we ignore it in favor of the evil root that RULES through our heart.\r\n\r\nAnd to Tovia's viewers, amazed at his intelligence, speaking of how wonderful they have it because they know the true God Hashem, I say:\r\n\r\nif you were tasting the LORD you would not be close to WW3:  I can't believe the STRONG DELUSION of people in religions, all of them, all of Abraham's religions are a CURSE upon the earth instead of a LIGHT to the world.  Abraham's children were supposed to REMOVE Adam's curse but they just multiplied it billion fold and sit around congratulating themselves while billions keep dying.",

Zero charges were brought against her.

IDF once released footage of these videos in much degraded resolution. \n\nThis could also have been the way how our intelligence services obtained classified information on Xi Jinping's missile deployment within China.\n\nThis retired General Dynamics director could have been the mastermind behind the plane crash killing the Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown of the Clinton Administration, in the plane crash in 1996 in Croatia.\n\nThe United States as we learned and studied in American high school does not exist anymore; it has been destroyed. \n\nUnited States have been dead.  American citizens don't have human rights. \n\nThis retired Director of General Dynamics is indeed a national disgrace of the United States. \n\nIf this America disgrace wants to harrass any American civilian, he just puts the name of this American into our Gov. blacklist for monitoring, and he can harass this American civilian.\n\nUnited States must stop this disgrace retired director from General Dynamics.\n\nOur Congress should carry out an investigation into our Gov satellite misuse.  I am willing to testify in Congress. \n\nI can give White House my name and let them check if I have been wrongly put onto the blacklist of terrorists for monitoring, just for some retired director  from General Dynamics for his personal amusement and entertainment.\n\nI am requesting help here from White House.  That's why I'm typing all these.\n\nWhite House can simply remove my name from the list of terrorists being monitored by the American intelligence services.\n\nI am the victim of abuse of American monitoring satellites.\n\nIt's easy to check.  White House may check if my name is on the terrorist monitoring list.  I am willing to contact White House.",

I have seen some news sources interviewed legal experts about the chances of him going prison, some of the legal experts being interviewed are in disagreement about the chances for prison time. At this point from what I have read, prison time is possible, yet is uncommon for the crime he was convicted of. Plus there is the fact that this the first time he was convicted of a crime. First time offenders of nonviolent crime, usually get a sentence that dose not involve prison time. They could be a few expectations out there, but that is what commonly happens.<br><br>As for the he won&#39;t be our president part, legally nothing stops someone with a felony conviction from running or being president. So despite this conviction, Donald Trump can still legally run for president, and he sounds like he still plans to do so while trying to appeal his conviction.",

Whether you love Trump, hate Trump or couldn\u2019t care less about Trump, it\u2019s undeniable that this was a weaponization of the justice system against a hated political rival. The Democrats in a deep \u201cblue\u201d state fulfilled their campaign promises to \u201cget\u201d Trump, their hated and feared political rival, by any means possible. They weaponized the justice system  repeatedly, until they finally found the  right mix of judges & jurors and fabricated charges where they couid get a verdict that went their way. It\u2019s a blatant weaponization of the justice system and it\u2019s unconscionable. Those who have a visceral hatred for Trump have proven time & time again that they will say or do ANYTHING to defeat him. Those same people who accuse their opponents of being a \u201cthreat to our democracy\u201d are, in actuality, the biggest threat to democracy and the biggest threat to fair & equal justice under the law. The Trump-hating main stream media, who are supposed to hold politicians and the justice system accountable for misdeeds, or at least ask tough questions, instead cheered on the procescution. The credibility and voracity of the charges weren\u2019t important. It was Trump and that\u2019s all that mattered. Guilty of everything, guilty of anything, just GET HIM. Meanwhile, they remain uninterested in the antics of the Biden family, except to make excuses and look the other way. \n\nThe Democrats have always been vocal about the corruption and bias within law enforcement and the justice system. They point out the false convictions and the people convicted falsely because of that corruption. But now, when they have their own target (the hated guy that they MUST GET!), anything goes. Corruption and weaponization of the justice system in this case is just fine, because the ends justify the means.",

You cant say its worth civil war to go after a famous person paying hush money, most of dem hollywood does it and no one cares. Cant say its for secret docs when so many dems admit to doing so for free. Cant say its for evaluation of property which is a business norm. Its fascism, controlling law enforcement by a single political party for party agenda. The nazis are rising and ignorant college educated people are chanting for it with the media in their corners.

The jury was unanimous. That is damning and his appeal is going to be a serious uphill battle which I don\u2019t think will succeed. He will now forever have be known as a convicted felon . And the thing is this is the least serious of his criminal charges . He still have to face those . The walls are closing in. He\u2019s been found liable in a civil fraud case , found liable in his case of slander and now found guilty in a criminal case of fraud . The clear evidence of the fact trump is a fraudster is overwhelming and it\u2019s only going to get worse when his other trials finally go forward . He can\u2019t hide from them forever . He can blame and deflect and cry witch hunt all he wants but this is all on him . Congratulations Donald you are a felon and you completely deserve it",

In 1948 and 1963, the SCOTUS declared it illegal for students to recite God's Ten Commandments or Jesus' teachings about our duties to God and our fellow humans. Before 1948, reciting or studying these teachings was not considered unconstitutional, but now we have a legal system that does not uphold the US Constitution. It has been deemed unconstitutional to recite or study God's and Jesus' teachings about proper human behavior.\r\n\r\nTherefore, corruption of the American legal system is an unavoidable side effect of legal workers having an education where it has been declared illegal to recite Jesus' instructions regarding our duties toward God and our fellow humans. There is no valid reason why American citizens should not memorize and frequently recite Jesus' instructions written in Matthew 5:43-47, Matthew 7:12, Matthew 19:18-19, Matthew 20:26, Matthew 22:21, and Matthew 22:36-40. Those who disagree with this statement should explain how our nation could enjoy more freedom if people in government were allowed to act against the teachings of Jesus.",

It&#39;s drawn from a random lottery of voter rolls and driver&#39;s license registry, and each side&#39;s legal counsel can each vet out and replace several of them with no requirement to provide justification.  The only thing the judge does in that process is enforce order if someone starts being a jackass.<br><br>His instructions to the jury were a) that intentionally instructing someone else to commit a crime additionally makes you liable for that crime yourself (direct citation of law), b) that each charge represented one specific falsified document (objective fact, and clarification to the scope of each charge and that they must be considered separately), and c) to be a felony as charged, the defendant must be proven beyond reasonable doubt to have committed that crime in order to commit or conceal another crime (direct of citation of law).  If anything, b and c make it <i>more difficult</i> to convict Trump of all charges by compartmentalizing them and raising the standard of confidence necessary for each one.<br><br>The defense testimony by Brad Smith was restricted in scope, which is something judges do when they know the legal counsel in question plans to use them to either interpret law themselves (literally not a witness&#39;s job) or chatter far outside of the material specifics of the case (wasting everyone&#39;s time).  This happens quite frequently, because defense teams with no actual defense tend to do that a lot and it causes a massive and pointless burden on the judicial system when they&#39;re allowed to do it -- and we know that was their plan, because <i>Trump&#39;s own team backed out of calling Smith</i> when Merchan predicted their intent.",

More and more Democrats will see that this was a sham trial. Dr. Dershowitz stated that even if Trump appeals, they will find him guilty simply because they are all Democrats.\n\nHere's the thing though: 1) This was a misdemeanor initially, but 2) the statue of limitations had run out on it. So whatever guilty verdict was made, it was illegal...by default. This is also from Dr. Dershowitz...Democrat.",

The entire World now knows the corruption and weakness of our country with the Biden Administration and the State of NY. Biden Administration is responsible for the Great Divide of People. Now we add the Division of the STATES. Corruption grows. (We believe in Trump. He is a true American. Today and Tomorrow. MAGA 2024. He came forth for We the People. We asked for him. We still want Trump). With or without a Demo gone Demon, a Traitor, or a Biden who's been hidden, or a puppet on a string,  Whether it's in his basement, at the Beach, or an Ice Cream shop.

I realize that 45 aka BLOAT(BIGGEST LIAR of all time) will appeal but this verdict is so restorative to my faith in the country and people that I truly treasure.

We\u2019re still a ways off from hearing his sentencing, and I\u2019m guessing he will appeal thru New York State courts until state appeals are exhausted and then I\u2019d be willing to bet he will appeal it to the federal courts, federal courts, if they take it up, will only look at it from two perspectives, we\u2019re rights violated and is the New York laws associated with his convictions in contrary to the constitution. On that note, if the laws have been previously reviewed by the federal court, any prior rulings will be the per se standard applied to Trump. Ie a federal appeal is unlikely to be taken up unless Trumps appeal lawyers have evidence of that, which nothing has been accused fitting the constitutionality of the charges. Federal courts refused to hear his appeal on the gag order, and the argument of constitutionality of ex president being immune is already settled. It\u2019s unlikely this will get appealed.",

I might add at this point, that just like drug dealers who make millions selling poison that kills people always forget that when they get caught, all of the millions of illicit monies that they were able to amass, ends up in the pockets of crooked lawyers that will drain every last cent trying to defend them. In the end just like this twice impeached, adjudicated rapist, and now a felon of 34 felony counts, who is still facing three other indictments for inciting a mob in order to stop a free and fair election, stealing and hording classified documents destined to be sold to the highest bidder, and election meddling in the state Georgia. Others states like Arizona are getting ready to file charges of their own. This really goes to show that Trump is anything but a genius, instead he is just a con man who learned how to manipulate his way to the top and continues manipulating suckers into giving up their hard-earned money which he gladly takes without even a thank you. Proof is in the pudding, how many suckers that got convicted and are doing time in prison because they listened to his bad advice of mobbing the capitol did Trump go out of his way to pay for their attorney fees or bail them out of jail? I know all of this will go into deaf ears, but it is the plain hard truth.",

They are all for the same action but no other crime charged as a cover up. The misdemeanor was past the statue of limitations. It wasn&#39;t charged before because they couldn&#39;t find a crime. It is not a crime to have a NDA agreement. Again there was no charge to bump it up to a felony. Go look for that other crime it was use to cover up. it&#39;s not there.",

He will exhaust the appeals process past the November election and probably has a better chance of winning now as his MAGA cult fanatics will come out in full support seeing it as the only means to save him from the \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d they see it as. Once president he\u2019ll be able to pardon himself or attempt to in which case it\u2019ll go to the Supreme Court which of course is right wing majority who will say its Constitutional as it\u2019s not clearly defined nor strictly prohibited and he\u2019ll yet again escape justice.

He says he has irrefutable evidence to prove it, but he shows up in court with absolutely No evidence but then he expects everybody to understand this. I don&#39;t understand something here. Maybe you can answer it for me. We ground our children to show them that there are consequences to be paid for their bad acts. Not just outside the home but inside the home, but everybody&#39;s p*<b>**</b> off. Because this man has to answer to and possibly pay consequences for his bad acts. We&#39;re serious. Our judicial system may not be the best, but it&#39;s the only one we have And I do believe that if Donald Trump was found innocent on all accounts, there are those that would be saying that we have to respect the jury&#39;s decision, but now that he was found guilty on all accounts, we don&#39;t have to respect the jury&#39;s decisions in donald Trump&#39;s eyes, everything from. The toilet tissue to the toilet seat is rigged. If it doesn&#39; Go in his favor the man talked about the judge, the jury, the judge&#39;s daughter, the jury or democrats and all of this stuff, everything is rigged. He&#39;s the one that said, if things go his way, everything is fine if they don&#39;t. Everything is rigged. This is the man that calls himself the law. And order President? But then he spends his time skirting the law. And at the risk of sound, repetitive. Or of sounding repetitive. I want to ask one more time. This man not come in court with this irrefutable. Evidence that he claims to have, but instead tried to get the case delay thrown out and everything else That man has to pay for his crimes. I would like for those same people To advocate for people that are in prison who&#39;ve been wrongly convicted, and there are a lot of them With that being said, keep your family safe.

Mainstream protestants and Catholics are fallen churches. They don't hold true Bible doctrine. They have placed themselves on Satan's ground and he's playing them like a fiddle. They are going to legislate a religious law soon. Sunday observance will be mandatory by all. This religious law enacted by the right is the mark of the beast. They too are pawns of Satan. Satan is playing both sides off each other to accomplish his goal. You might be smiling right now but it's not going to last. You had better get right with God in a genuine way. Public Satanic miracles will begin to occur soon and the entire world with the exception of the \"remnant\" will be swept up. There will no longer be any atheists. The entire world will be converted over night but to what? A false world religion. Do not go along with the Sunday laws. They are coming. Trust me, I know things.",

Plus he was a sore loser leaving the white house he didnt wanna be a sport and take his defeat,  so people wanna still put him in and go thru the drama again really.  U aske me He or Biden is not the best for running , i truely believe a younger person , a fresh face brighter ideas , and someone different that have not gotten a chance to do so.  Trump found guilty sinple as that , because he is guilty .. So no excuses or once again trying to put it on someonelse or some other thing etc.  Cant blame on no one else , but his self....Now he tried to down play like he was so innocent, and to fool people who were supporters of his , but he basically played w there minds , and he knew he was lying .

            "comment_text": "Donald Trump was found guilty Thursday of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star, making him the first former president to become a convicted felon.\r\n\r\nThe unanimous verdict from the 12-person jury ends a six-week trial in which prosecutors accused Trump of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAs the jury foreperson read the verdict, Trump looked toward the jury box. After the foreperson finished reading the verdict, the former president looked straight ahead, appearing somewhat red in the face. Then, as the jurors individually confirmed that they agreed with the verdict, Trump stared at them.\r\n\r\nIt now falls to the judge, Justice Juan Merchan, to determine Trump\u2019s sentence. He scheduled the sentencing for July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention begins.\r\n\r\nFalsifying business records carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison, but because the crime is nonviolent and Trump has no prior convictions, any prison time is far from guaranteed. Merchan could opt instead for home confinement, probation or a milder form of supervised release.\n\nTrump is certain to appeal the verdict \u2014 a process that could take many months or even years. Meanwhile, he stands accused of additional wide-ranging criminal conduct in three other cases: two for subverting the 2020 election results and one for hoarding classified documents after he left office. But none of those cases appears likely to go to trial before Election Day.\n\nDespite its historic nature, there is scant evidence that Trump\u2019s conviction in the hush money case will drastically alter his prospects in the 2024 race. He has a small lead over President Joe Biden in many swing-state polls \u2014 a lead that held steady throughout the trial.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the likely lack of fallout is that the payoff at the center of the case, and the events surrounding it, have long been publicly known: The Wall Street Journal first revealed them in 2018. And since the trial was not televised, the details of the legal proceedings have remained opaque to many voters.\r\n\r\nRecent polls have shown that most Americans saw the hush money case as less serious than Trump\u2019s other three. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in mid-May found that 46 percent of respondents believed Trump had done something illegal in the hush-money payment case, 29 percent said he had done something unethical but not illegal, and 21 percent said he did nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd Trump\u2019s allies in the GOP stuck by him throughout the trial: A rotating cast of elected Republicans and other surrogates joined him at the lower Manhattan courthouse most days.\n\nThe jury of seven men and five women deliberated for a day and a half before issuing its guilty verdict.\r\n\r\nThe panel found that Trump falsified business documents that reflected a series of payments he made to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Those payments reimbursed Cohen for $130,000 in hush money that he sent to porn star Stormy Daniels 12 days before the 2016 election. At the time, Daniels was threatening to go public with her account of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier.\n\n\r\nTrump, with Cohen as a middle man, struck a non-disclosure deal with Daniels to ensure her claims didn\u2019t damage his White House bid. But when Trump later reimbursed Cohen, he falsely designated the money as legal expenses in his company\u2019s books.\r\n\r\nProsecutors from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office charged Trump with 34 felony counts, accusing him of falsifying 11 invoice records, 12 general ledger entries and 11 checks, some of which were signed by Trump with a black Sharpie.\r\n\r\nIn order to find Trump guilty, the jury had to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt not only that Trump falsified the records with a fraudulent intent, but also that Trump did so to commit or conceal another crime. That underlying crime, prosecutors argued, was a violation of a New York state election law that prohibits conspiring to promote a candidate by \u201cunlawful means.\u201d The hush money to Daniels, prosecutors said, was unlawful because it violated campaign finance laws. And they said Trump\u2019s reimbursement arrangement to Cohen violated tax laws as well.",

Hilary also deleted at least 30,000 public records that she was storing with the classified material on the unsecured server in her basement bathroom. Meanwhile Trump is being railroaded by yet another corrupt leftist judge colluding with a leftist prosecutor using multiple levels of novel legal theory and taking the case before a NY jury that would convict a ham sandwich if it had an R next to it. The main witness against Trump is a convicted liar who presumably was entrusted to arrange an NDA in a legal manner but instead stole $60,000 from Trump. Stormy Daniels changed her story multiple times but she is completely irrelevant to Trump&#39;s case regarding filing of legal paperwork which begs the question why was she there at all?",
