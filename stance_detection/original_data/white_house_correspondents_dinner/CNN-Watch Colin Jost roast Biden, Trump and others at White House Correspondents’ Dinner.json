    "video_transcript": "Thank you, everyone. Hello. That was hard hitting journalism you saw in the owl. I didn't know you were going to show me from high school. That's surprising. Yeah, it's not really fair. You can't do it for President Biden because the technology wasn't invented when he was in high school. So really fair. Okay. Good evening, everyone. I'm Colin Jost, and I'll be delivering the Republican response. I'll be honest with you, I don't have a lot of time. I need to get back to New York because I'm juror number five on a big trial. Trump's lawyer took one look at me and he's like, He's got to be on our side. Thank you, Kelly, for that very kind introduction. Mr. President. Dr. Biden, Vice President Harris. Doug. Doug, as you can tell from all the comments about my wife, I'm also used to being the second gentleman, and I am honored to be here hosting what is, according to swing state polls, the final White House Correspondents Dinner. I hope that tonight will be a night to remember for most of us. I was excited to be up here on stage with President Biden tonight, mostly to see if I could figure out where Obama was pulling the strings from. I have to I have to admit, it's not easy following President Biden. I mean, it's not always easy following what he's saying. Like. But before I begin tonight, can we just acknowledge how refreshing it is to see a president of the United States at an event that doesn't begin with a bailiff saying, all rise? And I would like to point out it's after 10 p.m.. Sleepy Joe is still awake. While Donald Trump has spent the past week falling asleep in court. Every morning, though, Fox News said he was just being anti-EU. Woke. We are all here tonight at Nerd Prom. Well, Matt Gaetz is at regular prom, but I actually thought I saw Matt Gaetz here tonight. But it was actually just my own reflection in a spoon. Like many of you here tonight, I pretend to do news on TV. My Weekend Update co-anchor, Michael Che, was going to join me here tonight, but in solidarity with President Biden, I decided to lose all my black support. Che told me to say that, and I'm just realizing I was set up. I've done Weekend Update for a while now, but most people don't know that I started out doing the actual news. My first job out of college was as a reporter for the Staten Island Advance newspaper. They do not have a table here tonight, but they asked me to pass along this message to the other print journalists in the room. You think you're better than me? By the way, I want to point out, when I worked at the Staten Island advance, we had a daily circulation of 100,000. The Washington Post would kill for that. So as a former aspiring journalist, I want to genuinely congratulate all the award winners here tonight. Congratulations. The Correspondents Association provides scholarships to promising young journalism students who may one day be sent off to cover dangerous geopolitical hotspots like Columbia University. Tonight, this event is being televised live on C-SPAN. You do. And if you're at home watching C-SPAN on a Saturday night, I hope they find your body soon before your cats get to it. There are so many incredible news organizations here tonight. Also, a few credible ones. The Washington Post is here. Washington Post. They were the ones taking your coats at the door. Please be sure to tip. Fox News is here tonight. It's the end of an era. Rupert Murdoch stepped down at Fox News, which is strange. I didn't think there was a step down from Fox News. Trump media is here. Trump media Not at a table just screaming loudly in the corner to no one. Wardle is here tonight. Sorry. Sorry. I meant the New York Times. I forgot they do stuff in addition to puzzles. I have to say, it's not a great sign when the only thing keeping a print media company alive are games people play on their phones. Too chilling for you guys in this room just froze faster than Mitch McConnell. And I have to say apologies to the Times, but as a Staten Islander, I still get all my news from the New York Post. Thank you. The only paper where the front page always has the same 200 point font, whether the headline is World War three to start tomorrow or Central Park Owl Dead in Building Collision. The New York Post is like having the New York Times summarized for you by a crackhead. The Times will say a border deal continues to evade Congress and the Post is like these Mexicans are taking my stuff. There are so many incredible individuals here tonight. Lara Trump is here tonight. Okay, I got one. Woo! She recently released a cover of the song I Won't Back Down. Upon hearing it, Tom Petty died again. I can't believe I'm saying this to a member of the Trump family. But maybe stick to politics. Senator Bernie Sanders is here because he's not the type to pass up a free hot meal. And in general, there are so many hardworking, influential senators and congresspeople here tonight and I just want to say, on behalf of everyone I know, stop emailing us. Stop it. We get it. Democracy is on the line. And your plan to save it is to flood our inboxes like your Crate and Barrel. It's also wonderful to be back in Washington. I love being in Washington. The last time I was in D.C., I left my cocaine at the White House. Luckily, the president was able to put it to good use for his State of the Union. I'm kidding. Of course, the president doesn't call it cocaine. He calls it high speed rail. Oh, that's. By the way, can you blame the guy for turning to cocaine? He must be exhausted, orchestrating four separate trials against his rival, rigging the Super Bowl and gearing up to steal a second election. Wow. Biden laughed. I love, by the way, the Trump's two attacks on President Biden are that he's a senile old man and a criminal mastermind. I'm like, I think you got to pick one. Personally, I don't know any criminal masterminds who bike to get ice cream. Also, it's not like Trump himself is young and sharp. I'm not saying both candidates are old, but, you know, Jimmy Carter is out there thinking I could maybe win this thing. He's only 99. There is an election. There is an election six extremely long months from now. So let me see if I can summarize where this race stands at this moment. The Republican candidate for president owes half a billion in fines for bank fraud and is currently spending his days farting himself awake during a porn star hush money trial. And the race is tied. The race is tied. Nothing makes sense anymore. The candidate who is a famous New York City Playboy took abortion rights away and the guy who's trying to give you your abortion rights back is an 80 year old Catholic. How does that make sense? By the way, President Biden, isn't it crazy that he's only our second Catholic president? And what's even crazier is that in just a few short months, we'll have our third in RFK Jr. I'm kidding. Like his vaccine card says he doesn't have a shot. Everything feels strange now by a lot of measures. President biden is having a very successful first term, but people don't seem to realize it. Like with the economy, the vibes are bad, but the numbers say it's strong. The economy is kind of like you on the steps of Air Force One. It feels like it's stumbling, but there is somehow upward progress. I do think that you can do more. On the economy, sir. I really do. For example, have you considered eliminating the national debt by shorting Trump's stock? People keep asking if our lives are better than they were four years ago. Of course they are. Four years ago, we didn't have online sports gambling. What more do you need at? That's probably what's keeping the economy afloat. Online gambling and Taylor Swift. Without those, we'd be in a recession right now. The problem is, people are always going to compare your first term to Obama's. But I think there are actually a lot of positives, similarities. You both made big strides in health care. Obama got us out of a recession. You got us out of a pandemic. Obama got bin Laden. You got O.J. And by the way, now that O.J. is dead. Who is the new frontrunner for Trump's VP? Is it Diddy? Anyway, I bet if Trump did select Diddy as his running mate, I bet this race would still be tied. I think even some Democrats say that they are underwhelmed, but I think they're just not living in reality. Manage your expectations, people. It's like tonight. Sure. We all wish we were at the Waldorf right now, but we're at the Washington Hilton and we have to make the best of it. Just be happy you're not at the airport. Hilton journalists. These are challenging times and we need the people in this room to help guide us through it. Your jobs are not easy, and it doesn't help that we're living at the end of traditional media. The gatekeepers are gone. Did you know that 90% of people now get their news exclusively from social media? And that must be true because I saw it in a random guy's TikTok. He was recording the video while driving a Toyota Corolla, but he seemed to know his stuff. Isn't it crazy, by the way, that Tik Tok could be outlawed in the U.S. by the end of this year? That's a real shame, because we're going to need Tik Tok to document who is storming the Capitol next January 6th. Things are not bad for everyone, though. This may be the worst time in history to be a print journalist. It is the best time in history to be a courtroom sketch artist. My God, the most famous man on earth is on trial and there is no cameras allowed. Just the artists, their pastels, and their desire to make Trump look as bad as possible. Every sketch of Trump looks like the Grinch had sex with The Lorax. In closing. I would really like to take a moment to recognize all the print journalists in this room. Your words speak truth to power. Your words bring light to the darkness and most importantly, your words. Train the AI programs that will soon replace you. And finally, I wanted to thank my family, and I wanted to thank my friends for being here tonight to support me. I want to thank my wife for enduring lots of jokes and for agreeing to individually meet everyone in this room right after the ceremony. And is. That's really special, honey. Thank you. Don't be shy. Come right up. She hates privacy. And with my with my family in mind, I wanted to share one last thing with you before I go. And I wanted to share one thing with you, Mr. President, before I go. I lost my grandfather this year. As you alluded to, of a firefighter, William Kelly. He's the reason that our son's middle name is William. He helped raise me growing up, and I would not be here today without him. My grandpa was a firefighter on Staten Island for 40 years to make extra money for his family. He was a substitute teacher and he painted houses and sense of Staten Island. I should point out, it's not like the Scorsese the Irishman painting houses. He was not a mafia hit man. He actually painted houses. The FBI is here. I don't want to start a whole thing. My grandfather was another rare Irishman who didn't drink because he lost his father and his brother to alcoholism. And I swear. Mr. President, this is not an age comparison. You remind me of him. Some of your best qualities remind me of his. And I will say he was 95 and he was still great at stairs. I think it's because he didn't try to run up them. But the reason that I bring up my grandfather and I know if, you know, realize, Mr. President, but Staten Island firefighters are not normally your demographic. Staten Island voted about 70% for Trump in the last election, and the other 30% was for Giuliani. But Staten Island also sided with the British during the Revolutionary War. So we're not always on the right side of history. You remember that. But my grandfather, a Staten Island firefighter, voted for you. Mr. President. He voted for you in the last election that he ever voted in. I mean, I'm sure someone else will vote twice in this election using his name. But that's just how the Democratic machine works. He voted for you. And the reason that he voted for you is because you're a decent man. My grandpa voted for decency. And decency is why we're all here tonight. Decency is how we're able to be here tonight. Decency is how we're able to make jokes about each other. And one of us doesn't go to prison After we go to the Newsmax afterparty. And when you look at the levels of freedom throughout history and even around the world today, this is the exception. This freedom is incredibly rare. And the journalists in this room help protect that freedom. And we cannot ever take that for granted. So, Mr. President, I thank you for your decency on behalf of my grandfather. And I thank all of you, almost all of you, for your decency as well. I am very honored and grateful that you invited me here tonight. Thank you and good night.",

For the Love of Money. \n\nThe archetype of a Super Friends villain? \nWhen the guy reminds me Lex Luther.. \n\nThat doesn't say President? \nTo think he is running again and people still want him as a Leader. \n\nShows education really failed us. \nMust have been Christian schools. \n\nYou can have faith in whatever you think is reality. \nBut when I think of what is and has been ruining this Country\nI don't think of woke, the lgbtqa community and BLM. \n\nI think of KKK, videos of Nazi symbols worn in Americans\nThose carrying the Confederate flag and On January 6th we saw who carried it\nStorming the Capital. \n\nJust saying to me it's odd. So many have a hard time seeing what Freedom is, \nWhat America should be and what it shouldn't be, A land filled with blood and hate. \n\nHistory shows when I was a kid we are the good guys \nThe many that lied about Mr Columbus finding this land\nWhen there were always humans here.. \nI'm a big fan of Iron Maiden and the song run to the Hills. \n\nAnd thought of our founders having slaves... \nIn a free land well things maybe not to idolize. \n\nThose who say Let's make America great again, To me greatness isn't achieved by \nCreating songs about the Rich men being the only problem.. and attacking those poor and who eats fudge rounds. \n\nPeople talk about how high food is, which is true. \nBut not talk about how big corporations keep taking away jobs in favor of U scans and computers. \nWhich has been an issue for 15 years and only have 2 lines open at the store. Could be a problem.\nI'm fine with AI but not when it takes jobs aways from creative folks.  \n\nI'm fine with those owning guns, Not quite fine with the schools and public shootings that no one does anything to solve, \nBut the right always have the answers to abortion, poor folks, what God you should worship, who you are, who you can love? \nDoesn't sound like Freedom to me, It sounds like control is what they are after. To make a perfect world for them. \n\nSeems to me like America isn't great, never was, but we can strive to be better every day from learning from the past\nOf what not to be, But letting people live, teaching we all live in the world, we share it and if you read the bible, really read it and\nlove everyone around you. Love the sinner, maybe focus fixing yourself.. than perhaps choose leaders with millions and billions in a bank. \n\nBut who are educated to do a job Not how someone's religious view is, personal views are. \n\nDo things maybe based on laws and Freedoms all life in America.",

When something doesnt work we throw it out and replace it. Biden is the reason trump will win. Democrats are more focused on getting trump out over focusing on the nations issues. Everything is being handled worde than when trump was if office. How is it possible that a clown like trump maintained stability for the most part and a career politician cant.... I wont even bring up bidens age which we all know is a huge factor. These type of polls and shoe are all puffing smoke. We all know the outcome its a slow and announced death.",

In other words, the \"Presidential\" Presidents.\n The second list was comprised of those Presidents who during their term(s) had been judged by the same above \"yardstick\" as \"Dangerous, uncivilized  rouges who left unchecked represented a clear and present danger to our demooocracy.\".\n\n The results were staggering. The number of \"Presidential\" Presidents outnumbered the second cat-egor-y by 2 to 1.

Of course not - it was probably adolescent sniggering about Trump going to jail for 800 years. One problem - he isn\u2019t.

Each one of those things I consider good, but you will deflect and say, Trump made the vaccine (but Biden was the one who rolled out the vaccine which somehow is also dangerous?), the economy is not good (which requires you to define good), the infrastructure package is not good (again, which requires you to define &quot;good&quot;), and the appointed judges are not &quot;good&quot; ( again, which requires you to define &quot;good&quot;).

Not voting for trump because of the overwhelming evidence he is not a serious man to lead this country. Not for Biden because of his one sided policy toward the Palestinians. I fear no one but the almighty and I cannot vote for Biden because I feel he\u2019s not done what he could with respect to Netanyahu and his extremist government in the Middle East. The deaths of over 30 thousands innocent women and children as well as the death of nearly 1200 Israelis is unacceptable.  Hamas and the IDF are directly responsible. The Biden admin as well as the UK are responsible be it indirectly for the deaths and destruction of that place aided by our policies and weapons. Only the truth matters.",

If this was truly a democracy Mr funny guy here would have joked about how Biden is too old to stand trial for his crimes but isn't too old to run for presidency, coincidentally trump isn't too old to stand trial but they are the same age. If there was freedom of speech you would have been able to ask the president why he insisted on sending billions to fund wars and ban a social media platform that Americans use to earn a living and exercise their rights without being carried out by his Gestapo, if this was a free nation a foreign leader who is leading an apartheid state wouldn't be encouraged by corrupt American politicians to condemn American students exercising their rights and encourage the national guard to be sent against them. Criticising Biden isn't supporting Trump they are both corrupt but the fact the mainstream media is so disconnected that this fool would call him a decent man speaks to how dumb these people think Americans are. The only person who has spoken out against the military industrial complex, corrupt politicians and disgruntled journalists has been been Kennedy and Mr funny man here made it clear he doesn't even have a shot. Meaning we Americans have no shot. These are all criminals and should be right behind Trump in court listening to bailiff say \"all rise\" just like their buddy joked about. Now let's all laugh together as they burn the world down HA HA HA.\nWhen ever your done slapping each other on the back for a job not well done please go back to spreading misinformation and hate the Zionist nation isn't paying you to eat dinner and laugh, propaganda isn't going to spread itself get to work!",

Biden likes it when little kids are allowed to be pumped full of hormones at grade school ages before they even know anything about sex or gender.

            "comment_text": "I\u2019d personally like to thank Donald Trump for laying out the blueprint for Democrats to win elections.\n1. Candidate must be a draft dodger. Preferably, a billionaire whose charity has been shut down due to fraud so we can say, \u201cHe\u2019s a man of the people that identifies with me.\u201d\n2. Make it clear that prisoners of war are not heroic. Especially, the one that were tortured.\n3. Candidate is married but arrange for him/her to be unfaithful. Would be great if there was also an infant at home to demonstrate the candidate\u2019s loyalty and trustworthiness.\n4. Arrange with sleazy publications to ensure infidelities are kept private so that when they do come out, he/she looks way cool. Make sure fake news is published about opponents and repeat those lies. Wear a suit.\n5. Enlist likeminded media organizations but call the others \u201cfake\u201d. Ignore the irony with #4. Teach them your buzzwords.\n6. Candidate must demonstrate maturity by assigning childish nicknames to people he doesn\u2019t like.\n7. Blanketly call republicans something voters are scared of and words your voters can\u2019t define like \u201ccommunists\u201d or \u201csocialist\u201d. \n8. State republicans support some horrendous activity, like the murder of newborns. We want their votes, too.\n9. Make up crazy shit like frogs voting in states he/she can\u2019t win. Doesn\u2019t matter that frogs cannot vote. Make sure the gov\u2019t doesn\u2019t go berserk investigating the claim. Saying it is enough.\n10. Repeat with similar claims about mail in votes. And dead people voted, too. Don\u2019t forget about all the dead people. Should a state ask for evidence, have your attorneys visit but say they forgot to bring it.\n11. Don\u2019t provide any actual evidence for anything. Just keep saying it. File dozens of court cases. When they fail, just cry \u201ccorruption\u201d but don\u2019t provide any evidence for that either.\n12. Flatter the leaders of nations that murder their citizens. If gov\u2019t departments say they did something bad, just disregard and take their side.\n13. Should investigative arms of the gov\u2019t start asking questions, just say \u201cweaponized\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re coming for you next\u201d. Again, saying that stuff is plenty of evidence.\n14. Should Congress appropriate funds for a democracy one of your murderous buddies doesn\u2019t like, withhold as long as you can.\n15. Now that you\u2019ve convinced people that the media, elections, investigative bodies and courts cannot be trusted, you can do whatever. Be sure to keep gov\u2019t property and trick your attorneys into telling courts that you don\u2019t have it. Store in cow shit crazy places. Erase any video evidence. Mischaracterize law that says you can have their stuff. Most people won\u2019t read it anyway. Should someone knock on the door, repeat \u201craid.\u201d\n16. Have your opponents investigated for stuff overseas. Use personal attorneys and investigators \u2018cuz that\u2019s gov\u2019ts do in legitimate investigations.\n17. Should hate groups show great interest in your party, only admonish them when pressed but do it poorly. Say something really stupid like \u201cStand by\u201d. Invite interesting people to dinner.\n18. When debating, don\u2019t allow for intelligent conversation. Yell and interrupt. Loud, obnoxious people are smarter. Make it look as unpresidential as possible.\n19. Legal problems? Employee an army of attorneys but then say, \u201ctwo tiered\u201d something. You can ignore the judge just like any citizen.\n20. Say \u201cconstitution\u201d, \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and \u201cfree speech\u201d a lot. Most people don\u2019t understand what you say can be evidence of a crime just not a crime itself.\n21. Invite some na\u00efve supporters over for lunch. Maybe your hate buddies will show up, too. Tell them their future is bleak then send them to a sacred building where the bleak-future people work. Should your friends injure some people, take a break. Say, \u201cIt\u2019s the fault of the sacred building people for not locking the doors.\u201d A bunch of flags with your name on it is a good look through all the tear gas. Bring rope.\n22. When Congress is about to do something you don\u2019t like, site something in the constitution that says a friend of yours can fix it. If your friend can read, repeat the lie. When your pissed off friends start looking for him/her, wait a few hours for things to calm down.\n23. Should Congress investigate something like #21, #22 and present many of their findings on prime time tv, do not address it in any meaningful way. Should the findings be provided to the DOJ, just say \u201cthey deleted all of the evidence\u201d \u2018cuz that\u2019s in no way a really freaking stupid thing to say.\n24. Be the first religious candidate in your party to be obviously far from it. Like, not even close. Like, casino owning, jumping up and down on an orphan not even close. The infidelities are a plus. Hock a bible but golden shoes first. Jesus would like that. Respect.\n25. Get your picture taken at a nearby church where people like to gather. Again, tear gas is a good look.\n26. Lie. Lie frequently. Eventually, the lies get funny and they don\u2019t matter.\n27. Should an adversary appear to be older and frail, don\u2019t take advantage. Make some really stupid statements like, \u201cSolar panels kill penguins\u201d or \u201chis hair looks good \u2018cuz I\u2019m gonna wear a hat.\u201d It\u2019s fine strategy to look like a fool.\n28. When someone in your party disagrees with you, insult him/her with an acronym. It\u2019s a good way to strengthen relationships and keep experienced persons in the party. Defending your position with big, grownup words is silly.\n29. Say \u201claughingstock\u201d when referring to an opponent. Or \u201cthe world is laughing at us.\u201d Pretend foreign opinion polls comparing you to your opponent do not exist.\n30. Arguing for criminal immunity when under indictment is a good way to comfort voters. \n31. Appear corrupt by pushing for a family member to run the financial arm of your party or by keeping/pardoning criminal friends.\n32. Do not site actual gov\u2019t statistics to support your narrative. Use scary words. Numbers just confuse people.\n33. In the event of a public health emergency, give citizens the impression it will go away when the weather changes. Should health officials suggest wearing protective gear, like a mask, make it clear it\u2019s not for you. When the fake media points out how irresponsible that is, now you\u2019ve turned it into a political issue. Super fun!",

Gawd, felt to me like the event organizer sent an invite to Fox as polite protocol, hoping like hell they wouldn't show up.  But they did.   S**t!!!  \n\nFox was in a pickle.   Not going makes them look like weak Karens boycotting an event out of \"principle\", like Donald Trump would/has done.  Going makes them look strong, unafraid of the communist, socialist liberal boogey man that lives in their heads rent free.   \n\nReckon they knew their presence wasn't REALLY wanted and would be a total downer.  So they showed up to ruin the event and make sure others would be as miserable as they are.  That's a win.  Owning the Libs.

His sharp wit and biting commentary served as a beacon in the murky swamp of modern politics, illuminating the nonsensical twists and turns that define our current reality.\n\nAs he skewered President Biden with razor-sharp quips, Jost couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the baffling paradoxes of our time. How is it, he mused, that Biden\u2019s opponent\u2014a man draped in more indictments than a crime boss at a mob summit\u2014could even be considered a contender for the highest office in the land? It\u2019s as if the inmates in a maximum-security prison looked at him and said, \u201cHey, tone it down a bit, buddy. You\u2019re making us look bad.\u201d\n\nBut the real punchline lay in the eerie echoes of history. Hitler, the master manipulator who turned a democratic nation into a totalitarian regime with the precision of a mad scientist conducting a diabolical experiment. And while Hitler may be long gone, his playbook remains, its pages yellowed with age but its lessons as chillingly relevant as ever.\n\nIn a world where Orange Hitler lurks in the shadows, hungry for power and primed to exploit the fears and prejudices of the masses, Jost\u2019s words served as both a warning and a call to action. For if we\u2019re not careful, he suggested, we could find ourselves hurtling down a path paved with demagoguery and despair, with only our laughter to light the way.",

Go for it you can Google as well because I think I\u2019d rather have to pay $2 a gallon instead of $7 under Biden. Rather buy milk, eggs and bread with a $10 note instead of over $20. Would like there to be no wars. I\u2019d love to hear a President hold impromptu chats with the press. I\u2019d love a President who could actually talk and walk. Oh and not \ud83d\udca9 his pants. So if you are having trouble understanding this I\u2019d like to have President Trump back so we can get the borders shut and stop the sex trafficking of women and children stop the flow of these drugs killing young Americans.

On his way our Ex-President stopped by at a construction site to say \"Good Morning\" to some hard-working union-workers, whom out-of-nowhere started chanting \"Trump, Trump, Trump\", then \"USA, USA, USA\"! As the crowd grew by hundreds, a drone climbed to reveal they numbered thousands! Regardless, of what their plans were that day, they followed their fellow ex-NewYorkah (always a NewYorkah - some quipped) perhaps, as once the faithful followed Jesus, smiling, laughing, cheering, each one of them trying to vie for a better view, their ears aimed at his direction just to catch one word, or a bit of his laughter...anything. Something to remind them of the time that they took for granted just a few short years ago, when he effortlessly made everything alright, and they and we all could just tune into the news at night and hear him crack wise at another smart-ass who tried to catch him in a taste-less word-salad, or blame him for something he didn't do, or even worse had not even thought of doing! Then, a quick stop at a little shop, a bodega, that crowded instantly, yet around him there was space and respect, whilst he got his morning cup-o-coffee' just like any one of us has a right to do, meanwhile, pleasantly making sure to greet, not just a few, but ALL the smiling workers, and cheerful customers, hugging n kissing babies that moms handed to him! Then, the smile still on his face, he turned towards the exit, as the crowd parted to allow him access, unknowingly easing his access to attend probably the worst, lowest form of an insult and load of lies leveled against, repeatedly, ad nauseam, and if not illegally totally unfairly and most definitely COWARDLY towards quite possibly the finest leader of our life-times, a true living legend, an every-man, a modern-day hero, a man amongst men whom these purveyors of filth dare not face in person to utter such filth! This joke of a kangaroo court is commonly and widely-recognized as an aeons-old, 3rd-world, banana-republic tactic employed by low-life, low-powered-types to gain access to governments only to have the might of the good ole USA come in, and quickly bombard other these crooked leaders' palaces if they dared to attempt such maneuvers!\r\nWhy are some Americans in such denial over this? What is this BLIND hatred against this man? Why are they ChOOSING to BELIEVE THESE LIES, and PASS JUDGEMENT on crimes NOT PROVEN, NOR COMMITTED?!? Why have they opted to abandon our trusted principles, guidance, wisdom, and morals, en masse? Even after being proven wrong, debunked as liars they persist! Why?\r\nGet back to your roots, folks!

He&#39;s all about corporations &amp; billionaires making all the money they can off the back of any employees. He used fake people that weren&#39;t even union members in a photo op recently. The bodega photo op had a Young Republican group set up to follow him. New Yorkers do not like him, which is exactly why he keeps whining that he can&#39;t get a fair trial there. He&#39;s been in court for 4095 lawsuits, most of them because he doesn&#39;t pay subcontractors &amp; they have to take him to court to get paid. This is a big part of why New Yorkers don&#39;t like him. There&#39;s&#39; so much more, but I doubt I can permeate your fantasy world bubble. <br>I can promise you Trump will never see the inside of the White House again!",

There is no merit when everyone in the world starts at different positions in life but are judged by their ability to meet a standard without aid. If we are in a race but you start several feet ahead of me you can&#39;t claim to have won that race by your own merit. Providing aid so that someone can get closer to everyone else&#39;s starting line is not reducing qualifications it&#39;s creating fair qualifications that hold the same rigor. We should be seeking equity, an understanding that everyone has different positionally and that inclusive practices must be dynamic to meet these variables positions.That&#39;s not charity, that&#39;s leveling a playing field people have no control in setting and brings diverse perspectives that helps everyone grow. You assume all things good in the world are centered in your ideas of normal but that&#39;s not what evidence says. We miss so much knowledge and opportunities by excluding people based on arbitrary requirements that serve no function in our actual goals. The goal was to make everyone laugh, they laughed even with his notes. Unlike Trump, the only thing stopping this comic from succeeding is a disability that can be accommodated. He can and did do a fantastic job when allowed his accommodations.

I kid you not, we see our leaders read scripts and dare not vier off what's out in front of them.  I watched my MP the other day, and could here the fear in her voice.  This has to stop now !!  They have been chosen by us, and they can say what they want. No Arab country is going to intimidate my leader.. We see this everyday, MP's from both sides of the house read stuff with utmost fear. Now look here, no country or globalist body will ever DARE to intimidate our MP's.  These people are chosen by us to govern. No Arab country will dare try this stunt ever again. There is a force here in Britain that is intimidating our leaders and this must STOP. I do not care what the spoilt rich brats in our Universities say or do. These children are so out of control it's sad. My suggestion is this. Send them all back to their countries, then do a full audit of who is undermining our leaders. Our leaders deserve better than being treated like this. You Tony Blair started all this woke nonsense.  Now you Tony Blair end this. We sick of your political correctness.",

On his way our Ex-President stopped by at a construction site to say &quot;Good Morning&quot; to some hard-working union-workers, whom out-of-nowhere started chanting &quot;Trump, Trump, Trump&quot;, then &quot;USA, USA, USA&quot;! As the crowd grew by hundreds, a drone climbed to reveal they numbered thousands! Regardless, of what their plans were that day, they followed their fellow ex-NewYorkah (always a NewYorkah - some quipped) perhaps, as once the faithful followed Jesus, smiling, laughing, cheering, each one of them trying to vie for a better view, their ears aimed at his direction just to catch one word, or a bit of his laughter...anything. Something to remind them of the time that they took for granted just a few short years ago, when he effortlessly made everything alright, and they and we all could just tune into the news at night and hear him crack wise at another smart-ass who tried to catch him in a taste-less word-salad, or blame him for something he didn&#39;t do, or even worse had not even thought of doing! Then, a quick stop at a little shop, a bodega, that crowded instantly, yet around him there was space and respect, whilst he got his morning cup-o-coffee&#39; just like any one of us has a right to do, meanwhile, pleasantly making sure to greet, not just a few, but ALL the smiling workers, and cheerful customers, hugging n kissing babies that moms handed to him! Then, the smile still on his face, he turned towards the exit, as the crowd parted to allow him access, unknowingly easing his access to attend probably the worst, lowest form of an insult and load of lies leveled against, repeatedly, ad nauseam, and if not illegally totally unfairly and most definitely COWARDLY towards quite possibly the finest leader of our life-times, a true living legend, an every-man, a modern-day hero, a man amongst men whom these purveyors of filth dare not face in person to utter such filth! This joke of a kangaroo court is commonly and widely-recognized as an aeons-old, 3rd-world, banana-republic tactic employed by low-life, low-powered-types to gain access to governments only to have the might of the good ole USA come in, and quickly bombard other these crooked leaders&#39; palaces if they dared to attempt such maneuvers!<br>Why are some Americans in such denial over this? What is this BLIND hatred against this man? Why are they ChOOSING to BELIEVE THESE LIES, and PASS JUDGEMENT on crimes NOT PROVEN, NOR COMMITTED?!? Why have they opted to abandon our trusted principles, guidance, wisdom, and morals, en masse? Even after being proven wrong, debunked as liars they persist! Why?<br>Get back to your roots, folks! You were born or were naturalized to be Americans. If you&#39;ve forgotten what that means, shame on you. Go re-learn it!",

You&#39;re missing my point entirely.  And regarding the so-called  &#39;survived and thrived&#39; in NYC real estate is also hilarious. Trump literally was found guilty (and fines hundreds of millions) of business fraud and tax evasion for cheating and lying. Someone who cheats, lies and steals all their life doesn&#39;t operate from a position of confidence and security. These are weak people...who exploit and use other honest brokers to their benefit. ...because they do not have the ability to win fairly. The only way Trump can win at anything is by cheating. Have you been following the NY AG trial around hush money payments? Trump literally had a global &quot;news&quot; boss (national inquirer) in his pocket...fabricating stories about Trump&#39;s opponents and killing stories against Trump. What I&#39;m saying is, Trump never shows up, at least not willingly, at any event that he cannot rig in his favor. That&#39;s a weak, insecure person who lacks courage and fortitude.",

Trump can&#39;t handle any kind criticism and he reacts with hate and revenge.  This is NOT the kind of person we want in any kind of leadership, and Trump has shown time and time he has a thin skin, just like all the other authoritarians around the world.  And being able to laugh at yourself isn&#39;t the only criteria, but it is a better start than being a whiny petulant child incapable of reflecting on himself.  Biden shows far more competence, integrity, energy, intelligence, honesty, experience than Trump ever could.   You might not like some of Biden&#39;s policies, but at least he has policies.  Trump has nothing to show politically and is showing more and more just how far he has declined, even in the last year.  Falling asleep in court, unable to put a coherent sentence together, always blaming others for his predicaments and NEVER taking responsibility for his own actions.  It&#39;s funny, you say never vote if your only requirement is they can laugh at themselves.  Well hao about never vote for someone that is morally bankrupt, is in court fighting 88 indictments ranging from election finance violations, to bank fraud and trying to overthrow an election.  I&#39;d vote for the guy who was decent a thousand times before even considering the other.",

Watch the correspondence dinner from 2017 and see how false and stupid it is. Why would Trump go to that? Everyone one on this room including the fake comedian is on Biden&#39;s side. For you to think anything else makes you a complete idiot or liar. You don&#39;t have to like Trump, but if you want this country to work you have to be honest.
