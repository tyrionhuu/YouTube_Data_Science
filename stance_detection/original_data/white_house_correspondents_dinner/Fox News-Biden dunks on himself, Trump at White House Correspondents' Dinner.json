[LAUGHTER] I WANT TO THANK YOU WITH A WARM WELCOME. PLEASE, NOT SO LOUD. [LAUGHTER] DONALD IS LISTENING. SLEEPY DON. [LAUGHTER] I KIND OF LIKE THAT. I MAY USE THAT AGAIN. KELLY O'DONNELL, PRESIDENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. [APPLAUSE] LET'S BE HONEST. YOU ARE WAY TOO YOUNG TO BE PRESIDENT. [LAUGHTER] IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE I DELIVERED THE SPEECH AND MY WIFE WAS WITH ME, SHE'S WORRIED HOWEVER DO IT. I TOLD HER DON'T WORRY JUST LIKE RIDING A BIKE. THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT SHE SAID. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE 2024 ELECTION IS IN FULL SWING AND YES, AGE IS AN ISSUE. I'M A GROWN MAN RUNNING AGAINST A 6-YEAR-OLD. [LAUGHTER] I FEEL GREAT. I REALLY FEEL GREAT. I'M CAMPAIGNING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. PENNSYLVANIA, GEORGIA, NORTH CAROLINA. I'VE ALWAYS DONE WELL IN THEIR ORIGINAL 13 COLONIES. [LAUGHTER] SPEAKING OF HISTORY, DID YOU HEAR WHAT DONALD SAID ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR BATTLE? QUOTE. GETTYSBURG. WOW. [LAUGHTER] TRUMP SPEECH WAS SO EMBARRASSING THE STATUTE OF ROBERT E LEE SURRENDERED AGAIN. [LAUGHTER] LOOK. [LAUGHTER] EIGHT IS THE ONLY THING WE HAVE IN COMMON. MY VICE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY ENDORSES ME. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] I HAD A GREAT STRESS SINCE THE STATE OF THE UNION. DONALD HAS HAD A FEW TOUGH DAYS LATELY. YOU MIGHT CALL IT STORMY \n\u00a0 WEATHER. WHAT THE HELL? COMPASS BEST BUY HE STARTED READING THE BIBLE HE'S SELLING. [LAUGHTER] HE GOT TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT. YOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME. THAT'S WHEN HE PUT IT DOWN AND SAID THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR ME. BEING HERE IS A REMINDER, WHAT'S GOING ON IN CONGRESS IS POLITICAL THEATER. GOING OUT LAUREN BOEBERT A LONG TIME AGO. [LAUGHTER] TO ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE PRESS AND FOX NEWS -- [LAUGHTER] SOME OF YOU COMPLAIN THAT I DON'T TAKE ENOUGH OF YOUR QUESTIONS. NO COMMENT. OF COURSE NEW YORK TIMES ISSUED A STATEMENT BLOCKING ME FOR QUOTE ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVELY OF 20 INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS. IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE NEW YORK TIMES NOT TO BE EFFECTIVE, I'M FULL. IT'S OKAY. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE HIGHER STANDARDS. I DO INTERVIEWS WITH STRONG INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS WHO MILLIONS ACTUALLY LISTEN TO LIKE HOWARD STERN. [LAUGHTER] I KNOW YOU ARE LOOKING AROUND SAYING THIS GUY HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR 50 YEARS. TODD HIS MOMENT, GIVE SOMEONE ELSE A CHANCE. TO SAY THAT, I SAY IGNORE THE CRITICS. [LAUGHTER] EIGHT COMEDIANS OVER THE YEARS ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. WHO SAYS I'M NOT A REAL JOB CREATOR? [LAUGHTER] EVEN MORE COMEDIANS JOKE ABOUT ME LIKE THE FUNNY GUY ON WE CAN UPDATE, MICHAEL O'SHEA. [LAUGHTER] HE IS HILARIOUS. SCARLETT JOHANSSON, HE DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB WITH YOUR STATE OF THE UNION. YOU SHOULD DO WE CAN UPDATE. [LAUGHTER] CLEARLY YOU ARE THE FUNNY ONE OF THE FAMILY. FOLKS, ON A SERIOUS NOTE -- COLIN AND I HAVE ANOTHER THING IN COMMON. YOU BOTH FIND THINK STRENGTH AND FAMILY. I GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME IN THE OVAL OFFICE, HE WAS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHING IN STATEN ISLAND AND HIS MOM IS AN INCREDIBLE WOMAN. A FIREFIGHTERS, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER IN NEW YORK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT ON 9/11. AS A DOCTOR, SHE RUSHED TO GROUND ZERO, RISKING HER OWN LIFE, TREATING AND SAVING FELLOW FIRST RESPONDERS. RUSHING INTO DANGEROUS ROADS MIGHT DEFINITION OF PATRIOTISM AND HEROISM. [APPLAUSE] SO IS WHAT ALL OF YOU DO WHEN YOU REPORT TRUTH OVERLIES. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO CLOSE TONIGHT WITH MY GENUINE THANKS TO THE FREE PRESS. THERE ARE SOME WHO CALL YOU THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. THAT'S WRONG AND IT'S DANGEROUS. YOU LITERALLY RISK YOUR LIVES DOING A JOB. [APPLAUSE] THINK NATURAL CAPACITY DISASTROUS AMOUNT TO WAR. SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES AND MONEY HAVE SUFFERED INJURIES. THE REPORTERS HAVE LOST THEIR FREEDOM JOURNALISM IS CLEARLY NOT A CRIME, NOT HERE, NOT THERE, NOT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] RELEASE EVAN AND IMMEDIATELY. WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BRING HOME JOURNALISTS, FELLOW JOURNALISTS AND ALL AMERICANS. WRONGFULLY DETAINED ALL AROUND THE WORLD. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP UNTIL WE GET THEM HOME. ALL OF THEM. [LAUGHTER] THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF JANUARY 6, I WENT TO VALLEY FORGE AND THE MOST URGENT QUESTION OF OUR TIME IS WHETHER DEMOCRACY IS STILL THE SACRED CAUSE OF AMERICA. THAT IS THE QUESTION THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MUST ANSWER THIS YEAR. YOU LAY A CRITICAL ROLE TO MAKE SURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. DEFEATING THE PRESIDENT IS AN ATTACK ON THE DEMOCRACY. HE SAID HE WANTS TO BE A DICTATOR ON DAY ONE AND SO MUCH MORE. YOU TELL SUPPORTERS HE IS THE REVENGE AND RETRIBUTION. HE PROMISED A BLOODBATH WHEN HE LOSES AGAIN. WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. EIGHT YEARS AGO COULD HAVE WRITTEN OFF AS JUST TRUMP TALK. BUT NO LONGER, NOT AFTER JANUARY 6. SINCERELY NOT ASKING YOU TO TAKE SIDES. I'M ASKING YOU TO RISE UP TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE MOMENT. WHO PAST GOT YOU MOMENTS, DISTRACTIONS AND SIDESHOWS. COME TO DOMINATE AND SENSATIONALIZE POLITICS. FOCUS ON WHAT IS AT STAKE. STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US HAS A SERIOUS ROLE TO PLAY MAKING SURE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY THOSE. I KNOW MINE AND SODIUM. IN THE AGE OF DISINFORMATION, CRITICAL INFORMATION, PEOPLE CAN TRUST MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. IT MAKES YOU MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. TONIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST. TO THE FREE PRESS, INFORMED CITIZENRY, AN AMERICA WHERE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY AND DOORS. \"GOD BLESS AMERICA\". [CHEERING] NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO KELLY AND YOU WILL HEAR FROM A REAL COMEDIAN. COLLINS HAS TAKE THE JOKES. I SANG AFTER WINNING SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY, BIDEN BARELY EDGED OUT HIS CLOSEST RIVAL -- TIME. [LAUGHTER] COLIN, WHEN I WENT, I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF TIME. I'M GOING TO",

It appears they were afraid that he would see the laughter sign light up and start laughing before he finished his punch lines. Personally, I don't think his gaffes are any worse than his presentations, or his lies. \n\nLooking around the room, it was obvious that the only good thing in the room of quality was the food, that the rest of us cant afford....

This has been a terrible look for America on the world-stage and we have been the laughing stock and butt of the joke to many of the other countries all over the world. This is dangerous, and the people who are calling the shots and propping up this stiff, mindless zombie posing as the POTUS do not understand the danger they are putting Americans and our country in. They don't understand OR they just can't be bothered to care. Either way, what an embarrassing time to be an American... Let's undo the division that these idiots have forged amongst the people, and get our wounded country back on it's feet. Politics aside, we are all on the same team here. Let's put the government back to work for the people instead of serving only it's own interests. Let's go ahead and do what the Don has recommended and make America great again!",

Furthermore, a \"Democracy\" would imply 'majority wins', yet the government is only serving themselves and not paying attention to the People.  We are watching the evil lead the clueless in the form of this 'progressive/democrat' ideology which permeates Washington DC.  So many are rallying around the propaganda arm of the government (Main Stream Media) and believing all the rhetoric while reality proves the opposite of their rhetoric is fact.  America is being destroyed from within with the help of the 'dumbed-down, brainwashed, marxist/communist' masses who have been indoctrinated into this religion of Leftists.  Weak people make hard times...this is the weakest I have ever seen America, and the rest of the world is circling, ready to pounce.",

[4]<br>The IRS data further show that the Tax Cuts and<br>Jobs Act appeared to have a strong upward effect on economic mobility. The number of filers with an adjusted gross income of $1 to $25,000 decreased by more than 2 million in just one year, while the number of households reporting incomes higher than $25,000 increased in every income bracket.<br>[5]",

(For more detailed data, see my table published here.)<br>That means most middle-income and working-class earners enjoyed a tax cut that was at least double the size of tax cuts received by households earning $1 million or more.<br>What&#39;s more, IRS data shows earners in higher income brackets contributed a bigger slice of the total income tax revenue pie following the passage of the tax reform law than they had in the previous year.<br>In fact, every income bracket with filers earning $200,000 or more increased its tax burden in 2018 compared to 2017, and every income bracket with a top limit lower than $200,000 paid a smaller proporton",

The reason there was no criminal trial is because it didn&#39;t come up until the statute of limitations had been exceeded. Evidence is STILL presented in civil trials, and the evidence demonstrated that Trump is a rapist. And if you understood anything about Lichtman&#39;s system, you would know that it&#39;s unbiased: he has predicted the outcome of every presidential election for the past 40 years. Even your Feuhrer wrote him a letter saying, &quot;Good job on your prediction&quot; in 2016. His political leanings have nothing to do with the accuracy of his system.",

That shot was convincing.\n\nTo Biden I say, these people shouldn't be there while you think you're at a campaign fundraiser, but most think they are, just like Bidumb.  Good thing we have social media and Fox for comparison.  It's easy to see why they're trying to censor it.  \n\nFox is fair while the rest of the media read what the White House and DNC sends them word for word with \"reporters\" with low IQ's.  They're a perfect team with Bidumb.  I can't wait to see truthful reports about what went on when the camera wasn't looking.\ud83d\ude02",

They reiterated what you\u2019ve just said , so if they are falsely reporting,  then , I\u2019m afraid that you are also not telling the truth .  The article is dated from 2021 and Biden had only just taken office which means the problem of migration that you were so keen to mention happened under the previous administration too. Any idea who was president before Biden ? Do you really ( honestly ) believe that it only started in the first month of 2021? <br>CNN reports news . Fox is opinionated propaganda which their own lawyers said in the lawsuit against them . Glad you agree with CNN but it\u2019s odd that you then try to discredit them.  You can\u2019t have it both ways .  <br>Undocumented migrants made up roughly 2.5% of Arizona population in 1990.  6.5% in 2000 and 5.5% in 2010.   How do you feel that it decreased when Obama was president ?   I guess Fox didn\u2019t report it",

[4]\nThe IRS data further show that the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act appeared to have a strong upward effect on economic mobility. The number of filers with an adjusted gross income of $1 to $25,000 decreased by more than 2 million in just one year, while the number of households reporting incomes higher than $25,000 increased in every income bracket.\n[5]",

Anyone in his shoes would have some bad days tired times to.  Could you imagine if biden had to go threw what he&#39;s putting trump threw. \ud83d\ude02 he can stay away long enough to eat dinner let alone goto court everyday an campaign for president on another state every other day.  He&#39;s only a man and we arnt machines. We get tired to.  For your comment.  Okay to be honest I didn&#39;t pay much attention to the details of this particular case only because I&#39;ve got lost in the files of cases against him which so far off the 10 I&#39;ve kept up with he&#39;s totally right. They are just witch hunt set up by biden for election interference reasons. I see you did some homework on this one but with 91 indictments in less than 4 years there&#39;s clearly a witch hunt going on.  Common man lol. He never had 1 case till till the very day biden became president in trumps 77 years. Also biden calls the media to ramp up intense scrutiny against trump consistently as the media puts it and biden himself can&#39;t keep from dissing trump and spreading 100% misinformation strait from his own mouth. Biden recently said trump called for a bloodbath if he don&#39;t win.  That&#39;s misinfo trump was talking about the auto industry forsure. We all seen the speach. Biden then claimed trump said he would be a dictator on day 1. Nope all trump said he would drill and close the border that&#39;s not being a dictator. To me it seems biden obvious that biden is the dictator in the whole thing and I&#39;m voteimg for my 1st time in my 37 years this year for trump. I mean no disrespect I just don&#39;t agree with biden on anything",
