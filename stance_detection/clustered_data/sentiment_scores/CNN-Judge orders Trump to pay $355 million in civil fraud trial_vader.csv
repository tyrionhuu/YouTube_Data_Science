most people in business already know that the extremely wealthy have an unfair advantage ie if you are extremely wealthy more than trump apparently you can save 168 million dollars on interest payments most businesses dont have a huge profit margin maybe 20 percent is a good point for most this trail points out that the common person would have to pay an additional 168 million maybe more if you have less money the trump in interest payments effectively eating away at the profit margin so the extremely rich saves 168 million and can lower the cost of their widgets or use capitol in other ways to be more competitive while not affecting the profit margin this means the extremely rich will most likely win in a competitive business every time making the richest richer and keep the less rich in their place now government judge is stepping in to help the billion dollar finance industry keep this borderline criminal process going this should be the focus and the reason for outcry stop focusing on trump and see how the rich get rich while the rich are left with scraps,-0.6,0.9919,0.2729166666666666
trump should ask for an appeal the 454 million verdict is a punishment and not a fine but a large amount of money should be addressed by the court which is an unusual amount of money for a business practice that developers and business practices do they should also be protected by the law for a huge amount of money trump didnt borrow money for the city or change the measurements of the building trump borrowed from the bank and exaggerated the measurements of the building also by law he should ask for an appeal our justice system is corrupt ny should help trump because he helped ny when the city was bankrupt the judge should accept the appeal it is normal business practice by the law it is called unusual punishment and trump will be protected by the law the same court system that the judge rule god bless truckers and trump thank you for standing up against corrupted court justice investigate da and judge for not accepting an appeal justice for one is justice for all lets go brandon,-0.5,0.986,-0.0048941798941798
howdy folks and people around the world i have great news the share jesus christ is returning soon an if you want to be rapture ready its pretty simple one believe that jesus died on the cross and spilled his own blood for are sins was buried and rose on the third day from the dead in glory 2 admit your a sinner and your need him to save you 3 repent your sins on him and in faith and trust and believe in him to save you because as scripture say there be people left behind to face gods wraith and face the mark of the beast were a person will have it on there right hand or forehead so if you stay behind dont take the mark satay in faith to jesus for this time will be hell on earth lucifer will force you to take it do not accept it choose death i pray you and many get saved and my fellow christians spread the word ephesians 28 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god and romans 83139 31 what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us 32 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things 33 who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect it is god that justifieth 34 who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword 36 as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter 37 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us 38 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come 39 nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord,0.0,0.9693,0.2461640211640211

is there anyone celebrating in this comment section who wants to advocate for the position that this case would have been brought if trump was a democrat if you believe that then you live in an information bubble and have a warped view of reality if you acknowledge that this was political persecution using the courts then you shouldnt be celebrating because it wont stop here your side will get the sae treatment when power changes hands as it always does and our system of governance will be made more corrupt because people who challenge or contradict entrenched power and interests will now notbdo so lest they get the trump treatment this is just going to further strengthen incumbent power and corruption be honest the law was not applied to every other new york real estate developer who ever inflated the value of collateral trump wasnsingledmout and that makes us a nation of men not laws and equal justice under law is all that separates us from animals,-0.4,0.9622,0.1043388429752066

as far as willis she shouldnt be thrown off the case this woman had the courage to take this man down along with the judge and this is just applaud to stop her and the judge finished partially the job cause he still has a little bit work ahead of him should trumps tries to appeal hopefully hell be too broke to do so him and his two crooked sons as far as willis its nobodys business who shes sleeping with she wasnt stealing anybodys money every smart woman watches out with men men have swords in their mouth oh i took you here i paid for this i brought you that you know like now they own you she is a strong black woman being taken down humiliated just like a general guy he got prostate cancer thats nobodys business thats personal thats about his penis why does he got a broadcast it to everybody my brothers ashamed to tell the family that he has a problem with his nose imagine down there its just humiliating that they did that to her and they did that to him prostrate cancer serious its nobodys business i think the last thing that man was thinking about was broadcasting it he wants to get well theres a til its a new cancer cure for skin cancer theyre saying it might work on other cancers i hope he gets to see this as far as willis like i said its nobodys business nobody likes to people to know who theyre beding with thats nobodys business it rings talk and gossip especially around the job place it looks to me like theyre attacking our black people in high positions thats what im saying like theyre doing a domino drop going after every black person in a high position in congress the white house the court buildings they go on after all of them because these people had the courage to go after this crook and his family thank god the judge is white im surprised youre not going after him but im glad he had the courage to stand up and finish the job now we have to hope that they take them down and get them out of a country three years is not enough they shouldve charged him more money because like people are saying he was stealing that money from everybody not only the government,0.246,0.9571,0.0407625626007979

dr evil i want 370 gazillion shabadabadillion dollars how ridiculous i guess a win for optics for the time being is still a win you all know its going to be reverseddismissed on appeal instantly and i suspect the appeals ruling will also give trump inc a way to sue ny for damages to his company and punitive damages as well judge engoron focused completely on the fact that he and his organization may have knowingly inflated the property value to get a better deal in simplest terms that would be considered a lie in business with a bank that would also be equivalent to telling a bank that is giving a loan i need this much money this is what i think my property is worth i can get a loan with any bank i want so its best that you loan me as close to the amount i need and we will do business together a very long time and thats exactly what the did loan after loan and year after year every loan was repaid the bank made millions of trump the bank knowingly did a risk assessment and it was a no brainer and everyone made lots of money in the process not only that every loan application signed by trump and trump inc clearly stated that the property value provided was a guesstimation and that the bank was responsible in doing its standard underwriting to reflect a closer to current market value estimation this was their decision to make as to either take his word for it or underwrite the property to reflect current market value judge engoron sidestepped this issue completely even the banks involved testified there was no problem with the valuation given by trump trump is what they refer to as a whale they typically get better rates than posted due to the sheer magnitude of financial gains a partnership with them represent all parties satisfied and like a broken record no one was harmed in any shape or form during or after the financial transaction between both parties again this appeal will last less than a week to be completely reversedoverturned when the appeals trial starts,-0.2,0.9544,0.1064444444444445

dear cnn news please investigate the following concept very carefully if we interpret the actions of russian president vladimir putin as the retaliatory assassination of alexey navalny for the ruling issued by the judge against donald trump this fundamentally requires an absolutely invasive digitally and materially present instance of espionage either within the inner circle of the judge their courthouse or the trump legal team the assassination happened immediately before the ruling and public knowledge of its contents details but during its time of being typed printed and controlled dissemination this meaning a russian presence is somewhere within the 24 hours prior to these very moments of today there is a russian spy operating either digitally or physically within the united states which has to be embedded within this new york civil fraud case if the russian spy is within the inner circle of the judge or the courthouse the people who have access to computers and documents is limited thus the presence should be easily detected if anybody realizes they need to go searching for it if however the russian spy is within contact to the trump legal team then we would have undeniable proof that donald trump is in contact with vladimir putin the former united states president is an asset to the present russian president is by all obvious accounts a traitor the immediate arrest and isolation of donald john trump for treason is warranted and his candidacy for a second term as president is forfeited if this does not proceed immediately then it is a conspiracy to allow it to continue on if not for by as an intelligence operation then as a systemic corruption to deny this egregious vulnerability of western democracy because if the russian spy is operating freely within the courthouse so as to meddle about where else in association to donald trump are they operating in america there could be multiple locations and branches of governments and places of law that are technically compromised here,-0.7276,-0.6191,0.0474458874458874

judge arthur engoron hit donald trump with his biggest punishment to date on friday in a ruling that fined the former president 355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties engoron found trump liable for fraud conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records and he barred him from serving as director of a company in new york for three years but while he stopped short of dissolving the trump organization altogether engoron issued a blistering 93page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again legal experts say former president donald trump is likely to use a bond secured with his assets as collateral as the first step in satisfying the judgment in the new york civil fraud case brought by new york attorney general letitia james on friday judge arthur engoron ordered trump and his companies to pay nearly 355 million which trump has vowed to appeal under a socalled appeal bond trump would put up a percentage of the judgment and a thirdparty company that is the guarantor is on the hook for the full amount said joshua naftalis a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in new york its difficult to determine the full assets available to trump because his business is a privately held concern and does not regularly file reports with regulators in a deposition taken last year as part of the case brought by james the former president said his company had more than 400 million in available cash adam leitman bailey a real estate attorney in new york said trump likely would have to put up 10 of the judgment in cash plus an additional fee in january a jury in a civil defamation case ordered trump to pay 833 million to former magazine columnist e jean carroll on top of the 5 million verdict she had already won against him last year trumps attorneys argued during the trial that the attorney generals claims against trump had no victims the banks were paid back and were eager to do business with trump but the attorney general argued and the judge agreed that the fraudulent loans trump received at lower rates had an impact on the marketplace plus the law used to bring the claims against trump does not require there to be victims of fraud in a traditional sense,-0.15,-0.9679,0.0782954545454545

director of any new york corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years lol rotflmao so sweet so good just keep piling on more and more stress and anger on this clown and maybe well be rid of him before november too ex president donald trump and the trump organization must pay 354 million in fines a judge ruled friday issuing his longawaited judgment in the states civil fraud case the decision also bars them from seeking loans from financial institutions in new york for a period of three years and includes a threeyear ban on trump serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation judge arthur engoron handed down his judgment in a 92page decision on friday the ruling is one of the largest corporate sanctions in new york history the judges decision also blocks allen weisselberg the former chief financial officer of the trump organization and jeffrey mcconney former corporate controller from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years and permanently bans them from serving in the financial control function of any new york corporation the evidence is overwhelming that allen weisselberg and jeffrey mcconney cannot be entrusted with controlling the finances of any business engorons order states in addition to imposing limits on trumps business activities the order bans his two oldest sons eric trump and donald trump jr from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or legal entity for two years the two who serve as executive vice presidents at the trump organization must also pay more than 4 million apiece including interest weisselberg is ordered to pay a 1 million penalty engoron issued a scathing rebuke of trump his two adult sons weisselberg and mcconney in his decision writing that they refused to admit error even after four years of investigation and litigation their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological he wrote they are accused only of inflating asset values to make more money the documents prove this over and over again if the attorney general is permitted to retroactively insert herself into private commercial transactions between sophisticated parties no business transaction entered into in the state of new york will be beyond the attorney generals purview the spokesperson said every member of the new york business community no matter the industry should be gravely concerned with this gross overreach and brazen attempt by the attorney general to exert limitless power where no private or public harm has been established new york attorney general letitia james brought the civil suit in 2022 asked the judge to bar trump from doing business in the state and sought a penalty of 250 million a figure her office increased to 370 million by the end of the trial trump the trump organization and several executives including his two eldest sons donald jr and eric trump were named as codefendants in the suit even before fridays ruling the judge had largely affirmed james allegations that trump and others at his company inflated valuations of his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a decade and misrepresented his wealth by billions the scheme the state said was meant to trick banks and insurers into offering more favorable deal terms engoron ruled in september that trump and the other defendants were liable for fraud based on the evidence presented through pretrial filings the trial which began in october and wrapped up in january focused on other aspects of the lawsuit related to alleged falsification of business records issuing false financial statements insurance fraud and conspiracy the financial penalty james sought known as disgorgement is meant to claw back the amount trump and his company benefited from the scheme under new york law disgorgement cases are decided by a judge not a jury the lawsuit laid out seven causes of actions the claims of illegal conduct that james office said entitled the state to claw back illgotten profits and warranted severe sanctions against the defendants persistent and repeated fraud
