most people in business already know that the extremely wealthy have an unfair advantage ie if you are extremely wealthy more than trump apparently you can save 168 million dollars on interest payments most businesses dont have a huge profit margin maybe 20 percent is a good point for most this trail points out that the common person would have to pay an additional 168 million maybe more if you have less money the trump in interest payments effectively eating away at the profit margin so the extremely rich saves 168 million and can lower the cost of their widgets or use capitol in other ways to be more competitive while not affecting the profit margin this means the extremely rich will most likely win in a competitive business every time making the richest richer and keep the less rich in their place now government judge is stepping in to help the billion dollar finance industry keep this borderline criminal process going this should be the focus and the reason for outcry stop focusing on trump and see how the rich get rich while the rich are left with scraps,-0.6,0.9919,0.27291666666666664

dr evil i want 370 gazillion shabadabadillion dollars how ridiculous i guess a win for optics for the time being is still a win you all know its going to be reverseddismissed on appeal instantly and i suspect the appeals ruling will also give trump inc a way to sue ny for damages to his company and punitive damages as well judge engoron focused completely on the fact that he and his organization may have knowingly inflated the property value to get a better deal in simplest terms that would be considered a lie in business with a bank that would also be equivalent to telling a bank that is giving a loan i need this much money this is what i think my property is worth i can get a loan with any bank i want so its best that you loan me as close to the amount i need and we will do business together a very long time and thats exactly what the did loan after loan and year after year every loan was repaid the bank made millions of trump the bank knowingly did a risk assessment and it was a no brainer and everyone made lots of money in the process not only that every loan application signed by trump and trump inc clearly stated that the property value provided was a guesstimation and that the bank was responsible in doing its standard underwriting to reflect a closer to current market value estimation this was their decision to make as to either take his word for it or underwrite the property to reflect current market value judge engoron sidestepped this issue completely even the banks involved testified there was no problem with the valuation given by trump trump is what they refer to as a whale they typically get better rates than posted due to the sheer magnitude of financial gains a partnership with them represent all parties satisfied and like a broken record no one was harmed in any shape or form during or after the financial transaction between both parties again this appeal will last less than a week to be completely reversedoverturned when the appeals trial starts,-0.2,0.9544,0.1064444444444445
judge arthur engoron hit donald trump with his biggest punishment to date on friday in a ruling that fined the former president 355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties engoron found trump liable for fraud conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records and he barred him from serving as director of a company in new york for three years but while he stopped short of dissolving the trump organization altogether engoron issued a blistering 93page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again legal experts say former president donald trump is likely to use a bond secured with his assets as collateral as the first step in satisfying the judgment in the new york civil fraud case brought by new york attorney general letitia james on friday judge arthur engoron ordered trump and his companies to pay nearly 355 million which trump has vowed to appeal under a socalled appeal bond trump would put up a percentage of the judgment and a thirdparty company that is the guarantor is on the hook for the full amount said joshua naftalis a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in new york its difficult to determine the full assets available to trump because his business is a privately held concern and does not regularly file reports with regulators in a deposition taken last year as part of the case brought by james the former president said his company had more than 400 million in available cash adam leitman bailey a real estate attorney in new york said trump likely would have to put up 10 of the judgment in cash plus an additional fee in january a jury in a civil defamation case ordered trump to pay 833 million to former magazine columnist e jean carroll on top of the 5 million verdict she had already won against him last year trumps attorneys argued during the trial that the attorney generals claims against trump had no victims the banks were paid back and were eager to do business with trump but the attorney general argued and the judge agreed that the fraudulent loans trump received at lower rates had an impact on the marketplace plus the law used to bring the claims against trump does not require there to be victims of fraud in a traditional sense,-0.15,-0.9679,0.07829545454545453

this is the death penalty for the gump corp cuz his socalled business has always been nothing but the equivalent of a giant check kitingponzi scheme he throws a bunch of money into poorly managed projects that can never reclaim the investment so he offsets part of that by not paying the bills when they come due then he lies to insurance companies to keep that expense low while also lying to tax authorities to keep that liability fraudulently low all while then grossly inflating property values to lenders in order to get better terms and to borrow against equity that does not exist the way he kept all of the plates spinning was to keep churning more and new scams using borrowed monies from one to keep making payments on the others until he could get a new scam up and running then add in the wonders of money laundering opportunities that his projects in panama eastern europe presented to say nothing of the illegal enrichment from the middle east china while potus and the millions just rolled in just in the nick of time since he was already on the verge of going bust and being indicted just before resorting to a run for potus he just ran out of time and now when forced to work under the law with administrative compliance looking at everything it presents a way of doing business that gump has literally never experienced the simple fact is that he somehow managed to fail completely in the past even with all of his illegal advantages and ignoring of the law so the odds of him being able to do it all legally for the first time in his life are less than zero oh and lets not forget that hes gotta cough up a half a billion dollars so far just as a starting point for this brand new world to him his watching them all fail again and again while we wait for them to go to jail is the payoff for having had to tolerate these scumbags being allowed to live among us all if these years cant wait to see them all die broke exposed and alone,-0.92,-0.9905,-0.05525415444770285

a judge has ordered ex president donald trump and his companies to pay 355 million in a ruling in the new york civil fraud case the former president is also barred from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years lol rotflmao so sweet so good just keep piling on more and more stress and anger on this clown and maybe well be rid of him before november too ex president donald trump and the trump organization must pay 354 million in fines a judge ruled friday issuing his longawaited judgment in the states civil fraud case the decision also bars them from seeking loans from financial institutions in new york for a period of three years and includes a threeyear ban on trump serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation judge arthur engoron handed down his judgment in a 92page decision on friday the ruling is one of the largest corporate sanctions in new york history the judges decision also blocks allen weisselberg the former chief financial officer of the trump organization and jeffrey mcconney former corporate controller from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years and permanently bans them from serving in the financial control function of any new york corporation the evidence is overwhelming that allen weisselberg and jeffrey mcconney cannot be entrusted with controlling the finances of any business engorons order states in addition to imposing limits on trumps business activities the order bans his two oldest sons eric trump and donald trump jr from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or legal entity for two years the two who serve as executive vice presidents at the trump organization must also pay more than 4 million apiece including interest weisselberg is ordered to pay a 1 million penalty engoron issued a scathing rebuke of trump his two adult sons weisselberg and mcconney in his decision writing that they refused to admit error even after four years of investigation and litigation their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological he wrote they are accused only of inflating asset values to make more money the documents prove this over and over again if the attorney general is permitted to retroactively insert herself into private commercial transactions between sophisticated parties no business transaction entered into in the state of new york will be beyond the attorney generals purview the spokesperson said every member of the new york business community no matter the industry should be gravely concerned with this gross overreach and brazen attempt by the attorney general to exert limitless power where no private or public harm has been established new york attorney general letitia james brought the civil suit in 2022 asked the judge to bar trump from doing business in the state and sought a penalty of 250 million a figure her office increased to 370 million by the end of the trial trump the trump organization and several executives including his two eldest sons donald jr and eric trump were named as codefendants in the suit even before fridays ruling the judge had largely affirmed james allegations that trump and others at his company inflated valuations of his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a decade and misrepresented his wealth by billions the scheme the state said was meant to trick banks and insurers into offering more favorable deal terms engoron ruled in september that trump and the other defendants were liable for fraud based on the evidence presented through pretrial filings the trial which began in october and wrapped up in january focused on other aspects of the lawsuit related to alleged falsification of business records issuing false financial statements insurance fraud and conspiracy the financial penalty james sought known as disgorgement is meant to claw back the amount trump and his company benefited from the scheme under new york law disgorgement cases are decided by a judge not a jury the lawsuit laid out seven causes of actions the claims of illegal conduct that james office said entitled the state to claw back illgotten profits and warranted severe sanctions against the defendants persistent and repeated fraud falsifying business records conspiracy to falsify business records issuing false financial statements conspiracy to falsify false financial statements insurance fraud conspiracy to commit insurance fraud the claims revolve around financial statements given by trump and his company to banks and insurers the statements were prepared by accounting firms using spreadsheets of underlying data that included vast inflations of trump property valuations the defendants lost on the first claim persistent and repeated fraud before the trial even started the sept 26 fraud ruling engoron agreed in september with james office that it was beyond dispute based on evidence presented through pretrial filings that trump and his company provided banks with financial statements that misrepresented his wealth by billions the documents here clearly contain fraudulent valuations that defendants used in business engoron wrote in the sept 26 ruling engoron found as fact in that ruling that trump and the company overstated the valuations of many properties by hundreds of millions of dollars he cited the palm beach assessor valuation of trumps maralago club at between 18 million and 28 million for each year between 2011 and 2021 the values for which he paid local property taxes during those years trump valued the property at between 328 million and 714 million on his annual statements of financial conditions ivanka trump and her brothers said they couldnt recall many of the interactions at the center of the case including deliberations related to efforts to secure financing and insurance for trump property developments eric and donald trump jr both sought to pin blame on the companys accountants claiming they had little involvement in the preparation of financial statements that misrepresented the values of company properties but engoron determined that there was sufficient evidence that eric and donald trump jr intentionally falsified business records he found that eric trump intentionally gave mcconney knowingly false and inflated valuations for the seven springs estate a trumpowned property in westchester county new york the former president took the stand on nov 6 stopping to address the media on his way into court its a very sad situation for our country he said under oath he gave longwinded answers seeming to test the judges patience at one point engoron addressed trumps lawyers saying we got another speech and urging them to control him if you can as questioning continued trump defended the valuations of various trump organization properties said the companys statements of financial condition included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies engorons order criticized trump for failing to answer many questions which the judge said damaged his credibility overall donald trump rarely responded to the questions asked and he frequently interjected long irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial his refusal to answer the questions directly or in some cases at all severely compromised his credibility ivanka trump the former presidents daughter and once an executive at the trump organization was originally named as a defendant in the suit but an appellate court later dismissed allegations against her citing the states statute of limitations,-0.5,-0.9937,0.059473787953169384

dear cnn news please investigate the following concept very carefully if we interpret the actions of russian president vladimir putin as the retaliatory assassination of alexey navalny for the ruling issued by the judge against donald trump this fundamentally requires an absolutely invasive digitally and materially present instance of espionage either within the inner circle of the judge their courthouse or the trump legal team the assassination happened immediately before the ruling and public knowledge of its contents details but during its time of being typed printed and controlled dissemination this meaning a russian presence is somewhere within the 24 hours prior to these very moments of today there is a russian spy operating either digitally or physically within the united states which has to be embedded within this new york civil fraud case if the russian spy is within the inner circle of the judge or the courthouse the people who have access to computers and documents is limited thus the presence should be easily detected if anybody realizes they need to go searching for it if however the russian spy is within contact to the trump legal team then we would have undeniable proof that donald trump is in contact with vladimir putin the former united states president is an asset to the present russian president is by all obvious accounts a traitor the immediate arrest and isolation of donald john trump for treason is warranted and his candidacy for a second term as president is forfeited if this does not proceed immediately then it is a conspiracy to allow it to continue on if not for by as an intelligence operation then as a systemic corruption to deny this egregious vulnerability of western democracy because if the russian spy is operating freely within the courthouse so as to meddle about where else in association to donald trump are they operating in america there could be multiple locations and branches of governments and places of law that are technically compromised here,-0.7276,-0.6191,0.047445887445887444

in the united states civil fraud and criminal fraud are two distinct legal concepts that involve fraudulent activities but differ in terms of the nature of the proceedings the parties involved and the potential consequences civil fraud nature civil fraud refers to fraudulent activities that harm individuals or entities leading to financial losses or damages proceedings civil fraud cases are typically handled in civil court through lawsuits filed by the aggrieved party plaintiff against the alleged wrongdoer defendant burden of proof the burden of proof in civil fraud cases is usually lower than in criminal cases the plaintiff must establish the fraudulent activity by a preponderance of the evidence showing that it is more likely than not that fraud occurred penalties if the plaintiff prevails the defendant may be required to compensate the plaintiff for damages or losses in some cases punitive damages may also be awarded to deter similar conduct in the future government involvement civil fraud cases are generally brought by private individuals or entities however government agencies may also pursue civil fraud cases especially in matters involving fraud against the government criminal fraud nature criminal fraud involves fraudulent activities that violate criminal laws and the focus is on punishing the wrongdoer for criminal conduct proceedings criminal fraud cases are prosecuted by government authorities in criminal court the government prosecution brings charges against the defendant who is accused of committing a crime burden of proof the prosecution must prove the defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt which is a higher standard than the preponderance of the evidence used in civil cases penalties if convicted the defendant may face criminal penalties including fines probation restitution and imprisonment the severity of the penalties depends on the specific criminal statutes involved and the circumstances of the fraud government involvement criminal fraud cases are initiated and prosecuted by government authorities such as federal or state prosecutors individuals who commit criminal fraud may face charges brought by agencies like the fbi sec or other law enforcement entities in summary civil fraud involves private legal actions seeking compensation for damages while criminal fraud involves governmentinitiated prosecutions seeking to punish individuals for violating criminal laws the burden of proof penalties and the parties involved differ between civil and criminal fraud cases,0.0,-0.9998,-0.13267543859649122
