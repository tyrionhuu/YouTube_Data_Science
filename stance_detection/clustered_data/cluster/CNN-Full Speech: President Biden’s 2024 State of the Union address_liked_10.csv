what a disgrace speech joe didnt lay his vision for america it was a political and election speech all he did was blaming others for his failures for example where was he and the vp when illegal immigrants crossed our border in the millions he never visited once until just recently he doesnt care about our country and the security of our people i am an immigrant my family came from a refugee camp we waited over 4 12 years before coming to america i dont hate immigrants because i am one of them but i want legal immigration personally i care about the prosperity and security of our american people at the end of the day its all about families and our future generations i may not like the way trump speaks and portrays himself sometimes but at least he shows that he cares about the future of americans also at the end of the day no ones going to feed my family or pay my bills i know were not better off than 3 years ago i am a small business owner and under joes current plan my business suffers much lets get back to the basic fundamental values of our country we cant afford another 4 years of joe biden and his incompetent vp the world is laughing at us because of joes policies,2,1
man this guy is aweful hates babies being developed lies about tax breaks believes economy is great lies about medical expenses like trumps lower insulin and all of a sudden sees border is broken,1,1
worse president in history if you cant see it you are foolish,2,1
the most evil rogue and vile president america has ever known,1,1
to my american friends let me just say that you have president who has razor sharp mind ask putin,2,1
lets go brandon trump 2024,1,1
a sotu president worthy and perhaps more than that imagine when its predecessor gets space,3,1
hes not speaking to us the tax paying middle class people hes speaking to swamp trying to get approval sorry the american people eyes are wideopen nothing you said was for us the people it was all about you and your devilcrats swamp,2,1
hes being applauded for achievements that had to be done regardless basic human rights jobs medicine housing fixing roads,2,1
so happy that the president is so sane and so astute and sharp this speech proved his detractors wrong now its time to charge him with the classified documents he took while he was a senator the same thing that his doj is charging trump of,2,1
we deserve who we vote for and this man is the right man to lead the america for 4 more years,3,1
trump 2024 take america back,3,1
the poorest president,2,1
lets see this lying fool debate trump,2,1
mr trump are you watching this is what a real president looks like,2,1
america 2024 those who wish to be president must practice what they teach as gods people need inspiring to believe what they preach take heed therefore unto yourselves you overseers of the flock or the voters shall cast you out for your futures are not of rock life may place you in deep waters though it doesnt wish you to drown its your past record that lets us know who you are as you smile or frown if you wish to be remembered from the truth you must never part power corrupts the best of us when we stop listening to our heart politicians who wish to be praised by history must earn their fame by living the truth any who continue to mislead and deceive must be shunned by the voter at the booth wisdom is gods vision of soul in everything we consume fear and employ knowledge is mankinds only hope of fulfillment purpose truth and joy by tom zart,3,1
the more i listened the more i am thinking we need anew president some one that stops lying to us and tell us the truth stop lying to the people that hired you,1,1
so great to see a normal president,2,1
at least here is a man who can string together several words leading to a sentence and from there several sentences leading to a meaningful comprehensible whole of forwardlooking political ideas and visions a total contrast to trumps incoherent nonsense which the few times when something of it becomes a little understandable is only about himself and the injustices he belives little innocent donald is being exposed to or a large amount of folkseducing lies and simplistic phrases filled with megalomaniac delusions,2,1
a trump speech jabber jabber jabber blah me blah hate sneer yawn me me hate fumble blah blah me victim me victim blah sneer silly names hate blah me me me,4,1
the president was on fire tonight 4 more years,3,1
he did a very good job things are getting worse than getting better in some city townand state especially florida poor people will have to move out of florida because some cannot afford a one bedroom to rent in florida much more to buy a home,2,1
god bless great and gorgeous united state of the america forever,2,1
unfortunately for you and i donald trump is just the opposite he is a user of people and only cares for himself i am sorry to have to say this but his proven actions and words speak for themselves,1,1
trump never bowed down to putin,3,1
make sure you have the backing of obama,1,1
trump 2024,3,1
trump 2024 this idiot has got to go,1,1
very well said mr president god bless american people god bless america,4,1
he has executive order authority to close the border immediately but he wonthe doesnt need congress everyone knows this,1,1
trump 2024,2,1
worst president in the history of the world pathetic,2,1
he is such a liar there are families having to move in with other families because the economy is so terrible,2,1
brilliant but i just cant stand trumps sub in the picture all the time,1,1
he is out of touch with americans,2,1
best president ever,3,1
trumpet said he wanted to get rid of the constitution the document american laws go off of trumpet wants to be an autocrat just like his buddies kim and valdimir its insane people still think hes a viable canidate and would be okay with him being a dictatoror in other terms king for this country the thing the first americans fought to not have back in the 1700s trump supporters seem to want americas founding to be for nothing to go back to how it once was when britain owned our country ruled over by a kingdictator,2,1
should compare side by side trumps union address of 2020 and this so that all americans who watch and the world will see the honest difference of a president who works with dignity and a narcissist arrogant selfish moron who talks only about himself,1,1
my boi putin is laughing as we speak,3,1
admiration respect and fealty president biden votebidenharris2024 voteblue2savedemocracy keepamericafree2024,3,1
actions speak louder than words while i can agree to some key points in his speech our economy is 100k today is like 50k 6 years ago we need deflationhigher priority for tax payersamericans and less regulations for the private sectors to flourish while most of us want to focus on a better future its hard when our present has been built by lies i wish we had a law that made it illegal for our government to lie to us anyways were free to believe what we want at least for now social media may cancel you you may even get a random charge for posting different opinions with that being said trump 2024,2,1
am happy when he said america was built by middle class people not by world street and our ancestors were bought to america either by chain or by hand this is classic someone who knows america he lives in not like trump who thinks america belongs to his family history will tell i pray god should keep him stron and in good health,1,1
he earned my financial support today and vote on 06nov24 i wish there is another person to compete trump due to his age but he appears reasonable and in good health god bless the potus mr biden and our troops,3,1
funny the biggest topic of the day is the border and he doesnt mention and damm thing about the border just why is that and no one in that audience noticed that shit well the rest of us did,2,1
it un forgivable what this presdent has done,2,1
did anyone hear hate coming from this presidents mouth no no no,1,1
if trump wins russia china and iran will have game set and match the us will drop off the global stage our allies will switch sides and those who stand by the us like israel will lose the war trump seeing everything falling apart around him will reach for the nuclear option but it will be at that point where he sees the limitations of his power as the world changes with a new global super power whose not allied with the us,1,1
best president,1,1
angry and bitter grandpa how did this puppet become president lol we all know the answer stolen election,1,1
my president,1,1

you cant love your country only when you winbest quote of the night,2,1
320 fake lies trump bows down to no leader you mistake him with obama who literally bowed to foreign leaders and no foreign leader worries about president biden just buy some of hunters art and give directions,2,1
this is what a president sounds like couldnt even imagine trump making a speech thats positive but you can guarantee trump will attack people take credit for achievements of others and thats the man maga wants a looser a true bum that weakens america bless usa bless the peoplebut to hell with trump,1,1
he wont ever say that to putin face,2,1
cant even get 10 likes on this for the most popular president ever,1,1
actions speak louder than words fiery speech for sure but what he will actually do is a totally different story our country is in peril and all this man has are words nothing else hes had 3 years to make a real difference and now towards the end of his term does he finally start talking about taking action its all a ploy to get reelected hes full of hot air and wont do a single thing to truly help our country period,1,1
maybe he is senile but hes still the best us president in my lifetime,2,1
how can people stand this man trump is atleast funny at times id vote for trump if i was american,2,1
this guy is so dangerous to our nation so sad to see how many peope get brainwahsed by a well written speech he had nothing to do with he is just a puppet he has no idea what he is saying by tomorrow he will forget everything he said,1,1

what has he done for the betterment since hes been in office not criticizing just unaware,1,1

nailed it thats what a real president looks like joe trumpstomper biden is a good decent man doing a fine job serving america making life better with major consequential legislation like the american rescue plan the american jobs plan the american family plan the pact act the chips sciences act and a vax plan that took us from 3800 americans dying from covid19 the last day the previous guy was on the job to an average of about 70 a day now 15 million new jobs is a spectacular achievement they are the result of an economy running so strongly that employers have to raise wages to compete for scarce workers and wage growth is increasing at a steady 52 a year a 15 minimum wage has become a practical reality in most of the country the previous guy wallowed in crime as we saw manafort gates flynn broidy cohen nader stone papadopoulos and weisselberg convicted of felonies and his company was convicted of 17 felonies now we know he also ordered the theft of a treasure trove of our national secrets refused a subpoena and tried to obstruct an fbi investigation he was literally caught on tape showing war plans to a small group of people with no security clearance or any conceivable right to see that material he left office after failing at a coup which is in character because orange foolius fails at almost everything over 1300 people have been charged so far in the capitol assault phase of the coup by contrast president biden restored the dignity of the presidency and has a clean administration hes not paying off porn stars and we dont have to shield the eyes of our children from lewd photos of the first lady engaged in hot girlgirl action we are not treated to the humiliation of having the un laugh in our presidents face like with the previous guy our president doesnt send love letters to the worst communist dictator on the planet our president isnt setting records for playing golf on the job and hes not taking millions from 20 foreign countries our president is doing his best for all of us and is standing up for the rights of those who are bullied or discriminated against we can be proud to have president biden in the white house being a president we respect and admire four more years four more years four more years four more years,1,1

my president you did good,5,1
yes i watched bidens state of the union address and was not impressed not at all he rambled on about how trump is at fault for this countrys current failures he boasted and took credit for a prosperous state of the union but sadly this is far from the truth under his leadership america is in decline on all levels and on all major issues and all polls show this to be true this man is living in a dream of self grandeur as do i im 80 years old and my excuse for my self grandeur is that im not the president of the united states nor am i running to be president lets do ourselves and our kids and grandkids a big favor lets give them the opportunity to live free and prosperous vote trump24,14,1

wow for once a president that speaks his honest mind and backlashes all the criticism made of him i wanna say he has my vote cause this world is indeed in an unprecedented crisis and he addresses that clearly just as republican president ronald reagan would and just as vocally as libertarian president kennedy would i guess my only question for now is what fire does trump have but embers lol,10,1
mr president you killed it get out and vote the gop out of office,12,1
what a clown circus as they praise this communist and zionist piece of trash on the communist news network fjb,2,2
just remember this president supports toxic woke ideology and the chemical castration of children,2,2
when the other choice is a man like trump a man who with his money always sought power i will always turn away just like ross perot he didnt know a gd thing about really leading a country or gathering our nato allies at a time when there are multiple wars occurring yes we need help at home yes we need more border security but we will always need our allies trump was gonna ditch nato was enamored with putin and alienated all our allies its too late for america to be isolationist like before ww2 it feels exactly like a run up for another possible in europe and we are obligated to help putin isnt killing a million jews but ukrainians and his own soldiers instead some of the bravest fighters ever seen their drone use was a total game changer and showed us how our soldiers need to have a simple and interchangeable small drone program lastly if you still believe breaking into the capitol killing 2 guards and attempting to grab a politician wasnt a serious crime the problem is people like you ill agree the progressive party has went too far left what i cant unsee is the racist undertones comming from the republicans side they are so obvious in their purposeful actionswhy was george santos even considered and now look mccarthy the guy who vouched for him voted out lastly as weve seen we will never be able to erect a fence across the length of our shared border and guard it successfully just watching the maga group in the audience makes me sick they care not about the working class i mean come on every one of them dont believe in human caused climate change when the proof is incontrovertible yes pulling out of afghanistan was hurtful but was necessary after 20 years the taliban had bagram airport totally surrounded and we fled like vietnam i say we should have left after finding bin laden period matt a 4th generation irish american,1,2
what a load of lies and hypocrisy out of this fox mouth,1,2
people yelled about a lovely girl have been killed by illegal immigration our boulders are open widely in danger we the people still cheer to the idiot and want him be voted out four more years,1,2

greetings from finland hilarious to see how republicans incl the speaker cannot even civilized clap hands for we are all americans or something else which actually is not party politics we have also our problems but the respect of the president should go above else btw we just had a civilized election of our president all candidates respecting others and discussing even friendly,61,2
it is clear whoever wrote this speech intended to stoke division and further spread fear in the american public it is laced with propaganda rfk all the way,1,2

trump had a republican house senate but passed no useful legislation they were like kids who show up to class without their homework they forgot that legislating is part of the legislative branch,17,2
the divider in chief turned the state of the union address into a political ad a liar and corrupt politician who has destroyed our country opened our borders allowed 2 wars a botched afghanistan withdrawal and taken us to the brink of wwiii none of this happened under trump if the media was honest you would have a different opinion of joe the segregationist biden my advice is to watch a trump rally which is never covered by the mainstream media i attended the rally in richmond va and there were thousands of americans of every color ethnicity and religionthe lines wrapped around city blocks open your mind and allow truth to enter donald j trump for president end the wars now stop the killing now close our borders now,2,2

imagine if trump was in office essentially imported millions of future democrat voters on all our tax dollars like bidens administration has done if the roles were reversed would you all be outraged how about how they are gaming the system for new house seats by massively increasing the population in the big sanctuary cities such as nyc chicago la it doesnt even matter they cant vote yet its the increased population not citizens in all of these cities that will equal more house seats likely more electoral points in the near future take your bias away for just a minute look at that open minded as possible justify how thats not corrupt its the hopeful set up for about as close to a future one party rule as you can get that doesnt even count the mass amount they have flooded into texas there needs to be balance i am an independent gen z voter btw i just choose to look past the personality at times of trump see that his policies made most of our lives more affordable our country safer i know politics has become so polarizing divided so many people but we all do have a lot more in common than we think for the record i am all for immigration thats one of the greatest things about our country is our diversity but theres many many reasons why it needs to be done legally instead of opening up the border entirely for 3 years btw biden on day 1 used his executive orders to completely abolish trumps border policies then is now blaming him his maga friends for not fixing it biden has literally been to the border once in 3 years they know what theyre doing just look at the fentanyl flooding in the crime the children missing look what happened in georgia recently its not right,1,2
as a canadian watching this speech i would be extremely proud at this moment to be an american ashamed only of the heads held low in shame of past and current behaviour as cult members joe you have made a great showing of how some people of that age still hold dignity wisdom and humour intact people of america can be proud of this elder statesman,5,2
nobody talked about this but did anyone hear the line close to the end where biden talks about people should not have to go to prison because of weed like what obama said years ago and kamala harris gets up and starts clapping hard but she put a lot of people in jail for marijuana look it up its like why the fuck is she clapping what a hypocrite clown administration this is full of lies,1,2
dear modern republicans you are in the seats of congress why are you being led by somebody booted out and a wannabe you every damned one of you need to be on your feet and behind your current leader just as you would wish democrats would support your own if he were in that my friends is why you were elected selected to be there remember you get what you put into it i have faith in both parties to do the right things will you all,1,2

america and the world just watched republicans show their support not to america but for themselves by staying seated while true americans rose and clapped,1,2
hey republicans are you ok im just concerned about your health because you just got spanked so hard maybe theres a vaccine for that,2,2
3 minutes in and weve already quoted ronald regan clown country were fucked wassup beijing,1,2

the whole right side is so damn unamerican yall cant be positive about anything good because it isnt about what is being said it is who is saying it and you cant claim any kind of religious refuge because this is the behavior of lucifer that you would glorify yourselves instead of serving,1,2
cnn is definitely scrubbing this comment section,1,2
i remember when kamala harris was running against joe biden talking about how racist he was and now she sold out and joined hands with the dude that is crazy crazy sellout,2,2
get a good look at all the blue clowns and some red that just want to spend your tax dollars on illegals and foreign wars they will have money printed and send crates of our cash to foreign wars and have no idea where it went money laundering 80000 children the border zar doesnt know where they are at or what type of home they ended up in this congress is the biggest load of corruption in history a vice president who has accomplished nothing cant even write a speech worth speaking so she eats salad and crow,1,2

why is the gop so mean always angry thats crazy,2,2
thank you lord commence ivf to alabama and all states all over the nation roe v wade should exist not overturn,6,2
lie most americans do not agree completely with roe v wade which basically makes abortion under right to privacy so babies up to the second before they are birthed can be killed most americans support limits especially after the first 3 months lie it is not reproductive freedom it is abortion the opposite more like antireproductive or baby life termination freedom and what about the freedom of the child where do the human rights for the baby start a heartbeat when they suck their thumb around 3 months in womb lie roe vs wade was not over turned by trump but by the supreme court it has been debated and seen as bad sloppy law since the case closed because again it uses right to privacy to kill another human being lie women nor men can vote a justice out of office the statement biden makes agaisnt them is divisive nasty deceptive lie you cannot vote away even in the legislature a supreme court decision just like you cant make a law in congress that reinstates slavery because of the 13th ammendment they can be repealed through the courts though,1,2
cool yes thanks you soy math you démocrates of américain,1,2
amazing policies with education these policies will absolutely push america in the right direction,1,2

i literally was the 2nd to last person allowed to vote at this voting poll made it late after work but voted this election is too important to miss,140,2
one word is needed to describe the republican party denialist,1,2
why do i think this state of the union address is some kind of deep fake i thought the same thing about his debate with trump several years ago,1,2
he is right our democracy is in danger because our institucion has been politicize using them to get rid of his opponent he is danger to democracy,1,2
women power 2024 vote blue this november,1,2
thats what they got from electing mtg rudeness and a dense brain in congress atleast some republicans are decent not to interupt biden,1,2
native black americans freedom has been chaotic and tainted for centuries in america millions of dollars to foreigners not fair no vote for democrats from native black americans,1,2
the state of division confusion it was a political campaign speech full of accomplished from day one higher gas price border crisis inflation cartels enrichment should i go on,1,2
122 dayum he woke up and demands that congress does as well i guess no vacation plans for a day or two,1,2
president joe biden standing up for democracy against the gop clowns makes my heart sing feel a sense that the love of mankind will continueon the other hand i am sickened at how the gop would literally sit in their seats when the president is taking about children dyingi am starting to believe this election is not about the democrats gop it is about good versus evil that trump is literally the antichrist i am glad to see that democrats are starting to fight back,4,2
sorry republicans donny boy doesnt hold a candle tojoe,1,2
america isnt a democracy its a constitutional republic,12,2
american president should not bow down to israel cant believe he didnt try stop the genocide yet they went in to iraq and caused a war whos the terrorist mr biden israel runs the senate clearly,1,2

damn dark brandon is on fire here i love it vote blue to keep our democracy,3,2
look at all the little worms shaking their heads soon some of them will be indicted and not soon enough,1,2
stop the republican traitors stop the republican agenda restore womans rights biden 2024,1,2
dont you think the dems and republicans are on the same side to give the illusion that we have choices and the sheep play along these so called public servents go into office and come out as millionaires do you think something is wrong with the system,1,2
this makes me proud to be an american this is what old school american power looked like as opposed to watching a trump rally which makes me feel like im about to be offered a special kool aid,1,2
womens power watch us vote,27,2
the republicans sure looked uncomfortable during the immigrant part they know how bad they look and that their followers are starting to see their hypocrisy for themselves finally margarine started her childish heckling to try to interrupt his flow of speech but biden stemmed her stupidity instead she never matured beyond fifth grade,1,2
why is he shouting this is the most divisive sotu speech i have ever heard his son hunter does not even pay taxes trump already cut down insulin prices he reversed trumps policy on this and then went back to it and claimed victory also he is not responsible for anything its his opponent who has been in charge for the last 3 years politicians will always politicize every issue making it tribal they divide the people to win elections,1,2
during communism communists in ussr were cheering and aploading barely moving and talking brejnev for his every fart stalin was getting the same apload this is how totalitarean regime based on pure lie acts the urge for submission to power of these soulles people is insatiableamerica now this whole thing is dreadful to watch,1,2
biden we have to stop tiktok and temmu from hurting the american people we need to place more levies,4,2
unfortunately all im hearing is blah blah blah and witnessing not much action marquee phrases that dont mean anything if inflation has skyrocketed and food is ridiculously expensive affording a basically unaffordable health care plan affording mortgage rates that do not align with wages forgetting student loan wipe outs for folks who havent found jobs were worried about defense spending and international support and keeping corporations happy versus supporting those at home eg small businesses who make the us what it should be an america whose government needs to take care of folks who hustle to keep this country afloat,1,2
with every word spoken by president biden the republicans trumpers and magas are being proven bigger bigger liars i dont feel sorry for the gullible and delusional people that never double check what they are told they just swallow the lies like the children of israel did with the lies of the corrupt sadducees of jesus day as christ said stain at the gnat but gulp down the camel,1,2
two questions 1 why wait to do these things until next year if they are so important 2 where is this money coming from this was a campaign speech not a sotu,4,2
vote blue 2024 protect our democracy usa usa usa,1,2
cnn you are fake and gay,1,2
when biden said we all came from somewhere but we all are americans the gop members shown were stonefaced i guess that dont like the real america,1,2
a very impressively lucid delivery of the state of the union address,4,2
if you are smart you would stay on the ballot so you dont go to prison,1,2
watch who stayed seated when prodemocracy statements and antiputin statements were made if that is not a common thread running through both parties then we no longer have a two party system pathetic,4,2
how ridiculous jan 6 was planned by them and the fbi thats a fact we will not stand to hear to watch you destroy america anymore byebye,1,2
maga mike get your ass out of your chair and applaud,1,2
if mike johnson cant stand up to applaud the concept of america coming back strongerthats all you need to know they cannot support the most basic human goals that unite us and propel us forward their netflix watch lists must all contain nothing but medieval fantasies,1,2
ya democrats stop destroying statues,1,2
we need to pay more attention to our local congressman and women senators etc they put emphasis on the top to make us forget the bottom the people closest to average americans ask yourself when do you think the last time any of these people cooked dinner for themselves they dont live like us so why do we act like they do,30,2
banning high capacity weapons what about the ones you have around rhw white house even today,3,2
theres no lies you can tell to hide the disgusting republicans who support the attempt to destroy democracy,1,2
so embarrassed to say this is our leader pathetic,3,2
635 even the house majority leader had to shake his head in agreement you cant love your country only when you win,11,2
in case anyone missed it he talked forever using the misnomer reproductive freedom without even a hint of understanding that almost no one on the right or left wants to prevent women from reproducing nearly everyone with any significant political positionpower wants women to be free to give birth this isnt pre2016 china and nobody advocates that it should resemble that the right to reproduce is not even remotely controversial infanticide is the legitimately controversial question thats the literal opposite of reproduction,6,2
just look at that chairman behind him what a reprehensible individual needs to be removed,6,2
so shameful that hardly any republicans clapped at all president bidens proposals shameful of mike johnson shaking his head in denial of the statistics with gun violence president biden quoted trump as saying just get over it and johnson shook his head in denial it should be absolutely clear that republicans are not there for americans they are there solely for trump and no one else shameful just shameful,3,2
i dont think he understands what the supreme court does if he thinks they weighed the political consequences of their ruling they righted the ship period its not for them to write legislation that will align with the constitution they correct it when it does not,3,2
to defend democracy we need to eliminate collegiate voting and have our actual votes counted which they are not for presidency american govt is a joke,1,2
no talk about closing the borderno talk about about ceasefire in gaza bucht the name of that poor lady that an illegal killed no talk about the american but talk about sending more money to ukraine talk about violence but he defund the police yeah great job biden but what amazing its all of you cheering for that senile man yuk,2,2
i guess this was what fox news feared a presidential speech unlike the hatred trump spread daily,2,2
mike johnson and the republican party have been negotiating a new border protection program with the democrats for months and in the end when it came to the vote the republicans and mike johnson voted against their own bill because donald trump wanted to continue to use the problems at the border for the election campaign which shows that the republicans are not interested in the country at all but only in political power and selfishness,4,2
the repubs are booing lead pipe removal seems like for some of them its coming to late,1,2
democratic orchestrated applause planned and failed trump 2024,4,2
mtg is a real disgrace waring that maga crap and should have been kicked out of the chamber highly illegal what she did,1,2
vote blue,4,2
california is hard on women look at pelosi and walters,1,2
unlike pelosi the house speaker was respectful and i appreciate that ethics matter,4,2
i have voted for democrats independants and republicans and i can honestly say this was the most dishonest and divisive speech i have heard im not sure what country this joker is living in but its not the country he single handely has ruined this was a yelling dictactor delusional and full of complete lies,1,2
vote blue for america,13,2
people yelled at all the lies at least they didnt tear the speech like a petulant child,4,2
cnn the fake news master i stopped trusting them since 2020 they hide bidens lies,1,2
dnc usa rnc ussa so easy to see this vote not,2,2
he owned that room republicans clearly underestimated him didnt seem senile or slow at all trump does,13,2
look at all those unpatriotic wussies on the republican side who wont even agree with the condemnation of trump telling putin that he can do whatever he wants to our allies if they miss a payment to the mob boss pathetic beguiled by satan,1,2
lousy lame republicans,1,2
those republican psychos tears are making me thirsty and im canadian lol love you america p,1,2
what a clown show our country needs help we are too divided they all got what they wanted for americans to hate each other and fight like children while politicians spread misinformation god help us all,1,2
what a divisive speech this country is becoming a circus,6,2
doesnt look like a cognitive declining falling down demented man just saying save our constitution and country vote please,2,2
cnn is fake not real,1,2
thats not a state of the union address its a political ad,2,2
all forms or branches of government need term limits then you cant have life long politicians they should only be allowed to serve 2 terms period it takes away from the idea of corruption in the government because it limits how long they can stay in power and their influence on a worldwide scale,6,2
well that was certainly revealing if i ever doubted that the current version of the republican party is much more interested in power at any cost and much more invested in their party and its class and its donors than their country i have my answer now this was a spectacular restating of what america is and the insolent sullen republicans in attendance were visibly dismayed at that fact this republican party has become nothing but a vehicle of the grotesquely rich and an ungovernable bunch serving as obstructionists and nothing else a historic speech,1,2
vote blue vote for good vote for sanity vote for democracy thank you america,4,2
i love seeing all our rep and dem all standing up together clapping and cheering together something i havent seen in a long time gives me hope,13,2
brain deadwashed people clapping for a braindead president he couldnt lead a 2 car parade how about energy independence joe kamala klapping is revolting,1,2
scotus kangaroo court zero credibility its time to set term limits and get rid or the that can be done by democrats control of the senate ie vote,4,2
this speech was not a state of the union address at all this was a campaign trail speech couldnt even pronounce laken rileys name an american woman killed by an illegal alien then he goes off defending the calling of the illegal alien to an undocumented immigrant this is all sooo sad yeah obiden u said it you took an oath to office to protect this xountry against foreign domestic terrorists you have failed at your oath terrorists are all over the u s has been invaded by your treason,1,2
childish and unpatriotic how the gop sits in that chamber like petulant children it feels as if they only want to see the destruction of this country so they can make political points the republican party knows no shame only lust for power,1,2
i guess the billionaires private jets couldnt get the corrupted haters from the supreme court on time to attend the speech,1,2
i wish to all american friends to deeply feel a wakeup call and vote for this kind and wise man in order to save again their democracy and continue reforming and reafirming their laws to the better and keeping their humaine ideals deep in their hearts while applying them in their everyday lives for their children to watch and learn,6,2
as a finn i dont like to brag but i feel proud when i see how much that is still visions in the us is reality in the nordic countries since tens of years,198,2
vote blue across the board to stop the rapist donald trump from entering the white house,2,2
sounded like a threat to the supreme court,3,2
maybe its time republicans to join team america and get with the program they still have a chance to get on the right side of history,1,2
the usa is done for its all lies everything they say is a lie the bs clapping the bs divide they show all a show i would say wake up befor its to late but its already to late,1,2
people need to not forget history every 4 years look back see who actually deliver on what they promise because its eye opening,211,2
france just made it s constitutional right to gave an abortion,1,2
democracy is an mk ultra term used to silence people this elderberry is just a puppet and i look forward to the shenanigans satans minions attempt in the months ahead cough klaus shwuab,1,2
this is a disgusting speech not a state of union but full of division and attack of people in this country the disgusting president and this government doesnt care the inflation the border security the drug issues,1,2
come over to americas side speaker,2,2
if any of you wonder exactly what the maga gop stand for simply watch their reaction to all of the proposed ideas and plans president biden describes there is absolutely no movement from within the maga and gop republicans south side of the us capitols south wing should we think of this now as the new deep south with their minds so deeply entrenched in benefiting the new masters who own and run the supremely profitable corporations and banks in america but these days with every idea president biden offers ideas that will benefit a majority of the american people these maga gop republicans sit absolutely still exactly what do they represent certainly not the greater good and not a majority of the american people this is not politics when every maga gop republican represents their personal financial interests first and foremost and will not sign their name to expenditures benefiting the american people on the other hand the maga will move for corporate subsidies and to promote a corporations ability to do business without legal restraint ethical safety codes and moral reminders or guidelines andor restrictions that protect people and our land that supports life itself,1,2
reminded me of adolf hitlers rants dividing the nation against itself be careful what you rant for we can fight too,1,2
sick of the dreadful obiden administration,1,2
those who support trump and his actions including jan 6th and his cronies just know you are all cowards and fake patriots,1,2
oh we love our country joe which is why we dont want you or democrats running it as you are destroying it,1,2
the republican congress is derelict in their elected duties to pretext and defend the constitution from enemies both foreign and domestic republicans are complicit in a conspiracy to dismantle our democracy to succeed to the seditious acts of an insurrectionist former president and the interference of a foreign dictator putin,1,2
show me in the original constitution where it mentions the words democrat or democracy also i find it funny that no one ever researches the origin of these words they just accept them,3,2
wake up people we are not a democracy we are a republic look up the difference and quit giving your freedoms away,1,2
i would never have thought that the house of congress would have reduced to the maturity level of some crowd of high school students at the spring rally,226,2
they look so joyful and excited perhaps one weakness of democratic is talking and promising too much while the results often turned out to be wrong and embarrassing to the contrary dictators talk less and therefore make less mistakes and are always right like holy god are we really equal lielielie,3,2
playing politics,1,2
this is one of the great speeches in modern humanitys history if you do not understand level up there is a game going down and sitting on the sidelines either makes you complicit intellectually limited or naive if you do understand and reject bidens suggestions you you are the problem all the sophistry whitewashing hyperboles gaslighting if you do not get and cooperate with these concepts you are part of the problem when it comes to global fascism this biosphere tanking it or humanity being known as sociopathic locusts that cannot be trusted outside this biosphere zero tolerance the sociopaths are playing the game that they own the game and humanity is their hostage,2,2
as a foreign observant i can only ask myself where are all the sensible republicans of the likes of lincoln or reagan only one rich narcissist who is only interested to make himself great again has been able to hijack the proud gop so sad,2,2
he seems sane to me its really crazy to see when he talks about the price of prescription drugs and the whole other side of the room doesnt stand up and clap weather he can do it or not it looks like a room full of drug dealers as a canadian looking in the fact that americans dont get the healthcare they deserve is hard to see its the privitization thats a problem looking into politics its frustrating to watch both sides not come together on the things they agree on that benefit citizens,301,2
thank you mr prayers for standing up to the tyranny thank you for letting trump know that you aint to be walked on without getting down and dirty with them i look forward to all the proposed changes that youre making the end to the gaza and israel war best speech ive heard so far im 62 years old thank you for standing up to thank you for fighting back without throwing a blow,1,2
the nonstop ridiculous tds hysteria backfired in spectacular unanimity _ツ_ maga is unstoppable,1,2
look at the facts america no representative like the ones seated on the quiet side of the chamber of america should be allowed to make fiction into a fact much less a former president fourmoreyears,15,2
get this bill done republicans just block to use the argument nothing happened what a bunch of hypocrites,1,2
watching this speech again this is hoe americans can hold head high by having a moral compassion as a president to lead us back to the great country we still can be dont pass up the opertunity to educate our opponents the fight starts to work when we focus on true education the future is our youth,4,2
wonder if racheal maddow will cut his awful speech like she did trumps,3,2

this is your elected politician as it was he bungled the name of laken riley the 22year old nursing student who was allegedly murdered by an illegal bidens word venezuelan immigrant in georgia last month while out jogging he called her lincoln as in abraham biden later apologized for calling the alleged killer an illegal the problem was that her name was not in bidens speech or on the teleprompter nor had he even previously mentioned her name he only did so after he was goaded by rep marjorie taylor greene of georgia who interrupted biden by shouting say her name so he did even though he got it wrong biden does not even know my childs name its pathetic if you are going to say her name even when forced to do so a least say the right name said allyson philips laken rileys mother it was too bad that steve nikoui could not get bidens attention the way greene did nikoui is the father of a us marine who along with 13 other us military personnel was killed at the kabul airport during bidens 2021 reckless and botched pullout from afghanistan nikoui 51 a gallery guest of florida republican rep brian mast was arrested by the capitol police after interrupting bidens speech by shouting abbey gate abbey gate from the gallery abbey gate was the site at the kabul airport of the horrific terrorist bomb attack that could have been prevented a taliban terrorist took the life of nikouis son kareem 21 along with ten other us marines a us army soldier and a navy seaman some 170 afghans were also killed biden did not acknowledge nikoui or the afghan withdrawal he probably thought abbey gate was a beatles album biden must know that with america gone the taliban have resumed public executions in open air stadiums undoubtedly including afghans who had worked for the us but biden is not responsible for that or abbey gate or laken riley or his open borders or illegal immigrant crime or high food and gas prices or the world on fire hes not responsible for anything he is just walking on air happy and carefree i am going to have what hes having only make it a double peter lucas is a veteran political reporter boston herald 3142024,10,2

wow democrats arent playing quaint polite games anymore i loved this speech at times fiery at times poignant at times combative at times exalting patriotic forward thinking positive strait up strait talk from one of our most effective presidents ever pres biden presented a positive vision for our future while purposely contrasting himself from the orange maga man democrats are finally throwing down calling out the lies standing up to the republicans and standing up for the people they used to let the gop stomp all over them no more the dems are fighting back with the truth hey gop the truth you should try it some time i loved at the very end watching pres biden so comfy just chatting away with everyone making connections talking to old friends taking ppls phone numbers to call them later you can see the energy and fire he brought to the dems i loved watching him chat up the joint chiefs who normally are so neutral and ignored spanky but they were super comfy with biden its good to see our military leaders believe strongly in democracy i guess vp harris and maga mike had to play their ceremonial role right to the end standing at the dais not speaking to each other lol that was so funny and so sad a snapshot of the division in our nation kamala harris was smiling open waving to ppl while maga mike stood like he was clenching his sphincter with an arrogant aggrieved frown etched into his face it was funny watching maga mike in the background nodding his head at the things that a moral ethical person would believe in like no kids being hungry and making sure children are educated etc but hed voted against those things it was funny watching him frown and shake his head when biden touted the fact that he brought the deficit with china down not spankytoo bad about facts maga mike they just dont like up with your delusions pres biden knocked the sotu out of the park with a positive vision for america it was so refreshing to hear a president admit that we hadnt totally lived up to our promise of equity for all while at the same time promising he work for a future where we will get there ok gop take your grievances and your sad lil faces your orange monster and go whine on fox news about how you wish your delusions about america pres biden were real i noticed mtg trans closet case wearing a truckers cap yelling like some drunk dude at a ball game lol,1,2
this speech is stupid simplistic hysterical trite dishonest and has very little substance and fewer data it uses the language of a seven year old and contains the petulance of a five year old there is not one word here that a six year old could not use except hyperbole which his mentors must have put in to give a sophisticated touch even though he uses baby language i doubt he wrote this drivel himself trump also uses baby language but at least uses his own baby language because bidens mental capacities probably dont reach that far someone wrote it for him and they must have spent hours to get him to say it right he slurrrrrrrrs words repeatedlyfor example beaa instead of beat eknmy instead of economy ecporting instead of exporting pac instead of past buyaway instead of by the way and so on and so on isnt it cute the way both candidates angle for the hispanic and black vote by claiming they are creatinghave created unprecedented levels of job creation fro blacks and hispanics of course there had to be an appeal to the vaccine with no apology to the vaccine injured to me the reactions of the audience dont seem much different from those of an audience of the ccp or an audience in north korea,1,2

republicans wore laken riley pins during president joe bidens march 2024 state of the union address laken riley was a university of georgia student who was killed by an illegal immigrant it is absolutely unacceptable that her life was taken by the hands of one individual one illegal immigrant however that one individual does not represent all immigrants fleeing those same everyday atrocities in their home countries by drug cartels gangs and even their own governments furthermore wearing a pin for one university student killed by an illegal immigrant as a political taking point while remaining silent and refusing to act on the fact that thousands of innocent people including children are gunned down across the united states of america every day week month year is disgusting pathetic and unfathomable the republican party is complicit in all mass shootings by not acting most gunmen committing mass shootings are rightwing extremists republicans are not prolife republicans are prowhite prowhite male heterosexual patriarchy promisogyny prorightwing extremists prohate proexclusion prooppression etc republicans do not care about laken riley republicans only care about taking the united states back to 1861 that is what they mean by make america great again,1,2

to avoid another global conflict it is crucial to examine and possibly adjust us foreign policy a potential nuclear war looms on the horizon the possibility of a nuclear war hangs ominously in the balance the us is the only country whose foreign policy could have as destructive an impact as a fullscale nuclear war dont push russia the outcome wont be pleasant within the realm of global politics the us stands out as the sole nation whose foreign policy has the potential to yield consequences that are a fullscale nuclear war dont force china the situation is increasingly alarming with a looming threat to china that must be subsided the united states exaggerated belief in its military dominance built on questionable foundations has escalated global tensions to the brink of an allout war over the last three decades the heightened infallibility of policymaking has increased the risk of a catastrophic mistake leading to a momentous and potentially apocalyptic war underestimating russia in terms of nato expansion and ukraine policy constitutes a disastrous error that has proven to be a catastrophic mistake both china and russia have progressed to the point where dominance is no longer feasible or nearly impossible bluffs are no longer marketable for those who have emerged as significant superpowers as a nuclear conflict looms precariously in the balance the world is moving closer to the brink of catastrophic nuclear warfare which has severe global repercussions that extend beyond china russia and the usa when it comes to interacting with other superpowers the need for increased assurance can sometimes have unintended consequences at this moment the conflicts are severe and pressing indeed russia has made it clear that it does not intend to start conflicts or increase tensions russia has expressed its willingness to deescalate the situation with nato and they have also committed to not expanding further in the region regrettably the majority of subservient leaders in europe are conventional and devoid of tactical rigor emmanuel macron the president of france stated his commitment to preventing russia from winning the war macron ranks second in europe in terms of buffoon status following zelensky he merely elicits amusement from him it is crucial to examine and adjust its potential to avoid to prevent the next world war it is imperative to address and potentially alter us foreign policy if the us does not modify and adjust its power postures no one can prevent it except the us,2,3

i just want to remind the members of congress and the american people that if every citizen were to trace their family history they will discover a migrant as is the definition of a person who immigrates somewhere on their family tree the exception is the native american people whose families came across the baltic straits so long ago there are no records the second exception is certain people whos family were unwillingly stolen from their homes and brought to this country as slaves who were not treated with the decency every human deserves and for whom adequate records were not kept then look at some of our migrant citizens who came seeking asylum and enriched in some way our country just to name a few that you might have heard their name before albert einstein nikola tesla sonia sotomayor madeleine albright henry kissinger sigmund freud frida kaloh andrew carnegie jonas salk irving berlin mila kunitz and gloria estefan just to name a few so when we scream fuss and fearmonger about letting a migrant enter our country maybe consider that first american in your family and where you might be now if the american government had refused that family member to enter and become a citizen because someone was screaming your family member was just going to sell drugs attack people rape women and kill people all without ever knowing a single thing about you family the people who show up at our borders legally requesting asylum are not the people we need to fear you dont show up and go through legal channels while hiding a bunch of drugs in what few supplies you could carry i mean look at our current citizens we have a person who managed to get voted in as potus who has been found libel for sexual assault and fraud and those are just the civil trials now as he appears to become more and more demented every day he has to face the criminal charges against him as of this day the count is 4 indictments encompassing 91 felony charges and he is the person still controlling a large number of republicans in congress federal and state if that is not the prime example of the pot calling the kettle black then i dont know what to say he is claiming the migrants immigrants will commit the same types of crimes that he has allegedly committed and some for which he has been found civilly liable also when did it become acceptable for members of congress to just yell out disrespectful disruptive and disparaging remarks at the potus while he is giving his address to the nation because it sure seems as if we have elected some white trash to congress based on the actions i witnessed when did it become acceptable for the speaker of the house to sit behind the president and roll his eyes and making sneering faces while the president who has done more for this country in the last 3yrs then the prior president did for himself while he was in office because the lord knows that he didnt do one thing for this country unless he andor his kids benefited in some way i have to say mr johnson that your obvious disdain for a man who has given a lifetime service to this country compared to the person you dont only back but revere in such a way that it is sacrilegious and disgraceful much as your lord and savior donald j trump a man who thought his popularity as potus was based on how high his tv ratings were when he demanded time on every major channel so that he could ramble on declaring himself a genius without equal declaring he knew more than not just every expert in the room but every expert in the world instead of his popularity as president being based on public opinion this man donald j trump has proven over and over again that he is unable to complete a sentence without lying how can you and your colleagues who have proven over the last year that your formerly great party is impotent by not managing to stop the infighting the bickering and the cat fights within your party long enough to pass a single bill you have a lot of chutzpah to listen to a man who has been held liable for sexual assault and fraud and is still having to defend himself in four indictments against 91 felony charges you are supporting a man listening to a man and following the demands of a man who is facing serious criminal charges and blocking every move in congress that the dems and independents support all to appease a man who is showing ever worsening mental issues so i ask why what do you see in a narcissistic misogynistic paranoid man with borderline personality disorder and increasing dementia who still seems to think if he declares something that makes it not just right but law i think president lincoln is rolling over in his grave with all that mr trump has done to lincolns party i just dont get why you would support such a disgusting dangerous and despicable human being,17,3
its not freedom and democracy that is a stake around world it is the us loosing control because king dollar is dying because of over printing you can only abuse a currency even the reserve currency for so long the corruption endless wars dollar sanction abuse stealing ridiculous spending on ridiculous things and on and on and on the chickens are coming home to roost the question is not if but when and that when is rapidly approaching watch the price of gold even the ability to supress price is being lost as the brics countries are buying it up gold is the canary in coal mine when trust is lost in just about everything people start buying real things and wealth preservation tools gold is a big one,1,3

i have to admit the reprehensible display of speaker johnson was disgustingly apparent on one hand who _appeared_ to support to the words biden spoke by gesturing with nods and the occasional clapping what was most notable was his never standing and his eye movement the only part of the body that will never lie starting at about 636 he starts to move most uncomfortably in his seat at around 715 johnsons display was telling for he was there on jan6 and he knows the truth his constant shaking his head against bidens words is apparent satan is within him thanks to maga this was only 9 minutes in,1,4

the best speech hes ever given hands down,40,5
what a speech thank you sir,40,5
this is an amazing speech a real contrast to what i hear from the other side i like bidens sincerity and sense of humor,5,5

quite a speech for a senile president isnt it mr speaker trump would not remember 2 minutes straight from that speech nor understand any of its content for that matter on the other hand he doesnt care about content neither do his insane and ignorant followers,21,5
thank you president biden this speech was an encouragement to me,1,5
what a inspirational speech spoken like a true leader of the free world unlike his predecessor who talks like a spoiled 5 year old,5,5
loved this speech tired of all the bullshit from trump and maga not just bullshit but out right lies,18,5
president biden very well spoken great speech,18,5
brilliant speech a leader that cares for and has true empathy for the people of the world and not just himself of his country the us is lucky to have such a great leader because what is happening in ukraine is effecting the us and if putin wins ukraine he will continue to move west and the whole world will suffer greatly especially the us and its citizens i hope putin can be stopped soon i really do,1,5
this is the best american union speech i heargod bless president bidengod bless ameriica,1,5
the major thing i hate about these speechs goes for every president half or more of what they say is nothing but bs that they never do or they half ass itjust blowing smoke to make us feel good,1,5
actually it was january 1942 when fdr did his speech but that happened after the pearl harbor attack no big deal you gotta love a guy like joe biden a loyal american who is trying his best here is fdr doing his bit httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjawjqo9nrhst1781s,1,5
the most disrespectful speaker sat the entire time while president biden state of the union speech this speaker made the country more divided his will legacy will be the speaker of hate and divison vote thank for a great speech president biden,1,5
who wrote his speech,1,5
brilliant speech,2,5
incredible speech,1,5
compare this is with trumps 2019 sotu trump talks about unity bringing the parties together how strong america is the bipartisan bills they passed etc and biden screams with hate and divisiveness while talking badly about all republicans while also taking credit for the things republicans have accomplished screaming and lying doesnt make a nation united again just compare the first 5 mins of bidens speech with the first 5 mins of trumps speech night and day trump 2024,1,5
that my friends is a speech that should be the proof this guy is not too old and is stronger than ever donald trump could not hold a candle to president bidens ability to speak think and discuss in detail his devotion to the american people and to the world the competence and passion is solid its the best sotu address i think i have ever heard,47,5
public speech skill is one musthave capability a politician shall be equipped with but not a real competence to make a country great you have to see what he has done and what status the america is now,18,5
best speech ever thank you biden you are the best for usa,1,5
it was a good campaign speech so when is the state of the union,19,5
he did not write this speech,1,5
great speech,2,5
great speech mr president thank you for giving us hope in the american dream,1,5
brilliant address hes made promises he proved he keeps his promises he promised a healthy optimistic future for america and the world hes the best president america has had for a very very long time,18,5
wow this is a great and powerful presidential speech delivery nice job mr president,5,5
this represents a truly inspiring moment in american leadership over the past decade president bidens words resonate deeply embodying the charismatic tradition of articulating the nations values despite occasional slipups his message fosters a strong sense of inclusivity,10,5
636this was a great speech by president bidenand this is truth,17,5
wow what a speech is this an old man with an hour long speech wow,70,5
i just wish we could truly have authentic speeches that hit the core of our country soul this always sounds to me like hot air just saying what the people want to hear so they can applaud i am a no party this is how i see it period,2,5
yup a real good speech,1,5
something useful is going onlisten to reason useful actions mentioned work being done on all fronts am very thankful pray that it continues much needs to be resolvedall very well presented speech but i pray for him as he has experience as is obvious in this share with america,2,5
best speech ever awesome job mr president,10,5
that was totally truely truthfully the true brilliant speech of what america truely is and will be to stay as with the true president hear for all americans now and the future the true man and a true gentleman your real president mr joe biden thank you mr joe biden i love you for being true you,10,5
experience and logic showing up in this speech thank god,2,5
great speech thank you mr president keep on doing what you are doing god bless you god bless america,63,5
showing unity in congress speeches that are broadcast worlwide would be so important the adversaries and the whole world can see the division in that house and probably through out america thats a shame i found this to be a good speech cheers from switzerland,61,5
how did he manage to get through the whole speech without mumbling or getting lost,2,5
great speech with facts very inspiring and giving hope to the americans god bless you all,2,5
the speechwriters wrote nice short sentences for him how considerate,1,5
best speech lately may the free world prevail arm ukraine,10,5
great state of the union speech,1,5
this speech is greatness,2,5
how is this a state of the union this is a campaign speech,2,5
impressive speech biden blows trump away,1,5
fantastic speech president biden you said almost exactly how i feel,1,5
mind blowing speech,2,5
a cleverly written and thoughtful speech very well delivered im kind of impressed,50,5
potus did a great job good speech sotu,2,5
very competent speech good substance well done pres biden,1,5
this is just a really good speech and generally about the goals that should be held by both parties putting people to work in wellpaying union jobs manufacturing in america and investing in roads broadband clean water and other infrastructure the only reason republican politicians find this speech divisive is because they cant stand it when someone accurately describes the things theyve said and done really hope more and more republican voters will see the republican party for the sham it has become,2,5
the obnoxious point dexter nerd speaker of the house was evidently the most disrespectful speaker ever in history to think he only got up one time during the whole speech to applaud the president hopefully he will be the next speaker to get impeach,1,5
this was a powerful speech i have faith,5,5
what a powerful speech every year his speeches get better and the republicans look more like pretenders,2,5
this speech was so far from the truth when you got control of office you brougth the united states to the worst time ever everything that came out of your mouth was so far from the truth,1,5
excellent speech hey republicans stop bei being aholes do your jobs and pass the border security and defense bill,2,5
america is indeed the best county on earth this is the best speech and it brought tears to my eyes love to this patriot,8,5
what an amazing speech worthy of is role excellent,1,5
a pretty good speech i think the ideas were on point with regards to his delivery the man had a speech impediment and became a politician anyway its been shown that people when they arent told who or what party said something agree with policies these are sensible humanistic policies that hes talking about you must vote on the policies not the party or the person this person had achieved so much behind the scenes to do what he believes which is to help all americans he doesnt brag about his track record on twitter but hes actually gotten an immense amount of stuff done thats what he does he does his job as an elected public servant of the people thats what a president should do,1,5
brilliant speech truly impressive president biden,19,5
i have much better public speaking skills chairman kim,1,5
fantastic speech,2,5
this was an absolutely incredible career defining speech im absolutely ready for 4 more years,5,5
campaign speech at best like listening to someone gargling glass,1,5

as an englishman id say theres a decent man i didnt expect to watch it all the way through but i did and was impressed by the way he kept me hooked for near 2 hours considering the opposition reelecting him is a nobrainer,2,7
what planet is he on so much bs,1,7
saying it out loud doesnt make it true you clown,1,7
this is a dog and pony show kamala is making me dizzy watching her jump up and down clapping like a trained circus monkey,1,7
love this man gives me hope someone actually gets it someone who can relate to the people its night and day folks so natural believes and does what he says,4,7
i guess they gave him a massive shot of cocaine and andrenochrome before he went on 249,1,7
all the chanting and clapping is a little much let the guy talk for christs sake,1,7
this man is an incredible liar,5,7
i wonder how much they had to pay everyone to clap like that for himfjb,3,7
its easy to give an energetic speech when youre cracked out on amphetamines,3,7
who is cheering for this guy other than that you know the usual crooked clan god is just so fucking staged it is ridiculous i cant believe im doing any justice by watching this fucking buffoon,2,7
5040 what was that guy yelling about i couldnt make out anything besides united states marines,3,7
bidens handlers clearly had him on some serious drugs for this speech,2,7
wonder what they pumped him full of before this,2,7
maybe this couldve been 10 minutes long if people didnt clap every 5 seconds,221,7
masterpiece of acting great show,2,7

can someone help me find the mark where the camera pans on aoc and she leans over to her left to make a comment to someone because if you read her lips and the vibe she gives it literally looks like she saying she literally stands for everything he says talking about kamala harris,1,7
why do they stand up so often when agreeing especially the vp looks so uncanny,1,7
someone should check his lead pipes,1,7

biden was close friends with a grand cyclops from the kkk biden cited the grand cyclops as his life mentor and friend truth,1,7
doesnt the speaker look really uncomfortable,420,7
my god this pos delivered the most dishonest the most disgusting address that has ever been delivered i wonder just how many of hunters crack rocks did he have to smoke to stay awake for this reprehensible bull sht,1,7
they have to do extremely long claps so he can be fed his next lines,1,7

mtg was she breaking congress rules by dressing like she did i seen another man dress under code too,3,7

i cannt help but notice the amount of time the vice president got up to clap unnecessary,3,7
i notised there were words he couldnt swallow no more splitting familyes,3,7
why cant he sound like this all the time,1,7
is this guy that delusional or that much of a chronic liar maybe both disturbing immorality,3,7
my favorite scene was watching the upset faces of gop senators when biden said he wanted billionaires to pay the same tax rates as teachers,115,7
actions speak louder than words,3,7
him sounding coherent is an anomaly,4,7
his last one,1,7
i cant understand how yall actually believe what he said like the last 4 yrs didnt even happen smh,3,7
is he chinese,1,7
please pay attention to 4612 where maga mike starts nodding and then realizes that he has to shake his head pure comedy gold d,126,7

someone tell camila to sit down she look like she got cue cards telling her to send up smh,2,7
dude killed it gop response was creepy af,195,7
the ai and socalled misinformation with youtube is laughable,3,7
anytime he misspeaks pauses and restarts i remember he overcame a stutter and is probably still using those techniques to take a breath and recenter a thoughtful pause is always preferable to filling the silence with verbal diarrhea,5,7
he didnt change his dieper once,5,7
why is he screaming the whole time,2,7
the state of the union drinking game take a shot every time harris stands up and claps,3,7
what did they give him,5,7

i cant stand listening to this idiot anymore,2,7
watching mike squirm proves he is ashamed of himself for bowing to a psychotic dictator,2,7
why does everyone get so excited when he quotes history the present is too grim so talk about 1941,1,7
is he addressing us or the people in the room,2,7
i love the fact he mentions all enemies foreign and domestic we have far too many domestic enemy and i have named seattle police officers guild as a domestic enemy research it for yourself i say the designation is not only valid the cops of seattle earned their rating crap minus three negative 3 equals domestic enemy they falsely arrested the wrong hombre 080823 i had warned them in writing years before the 8823 incident,2,7
what was that guy yelling at 5045,3,7

this man can go to hell,5,7
i feel bad for the speaker of house he has to sit so close to the smelly bullshit flowing from bidens mouth harris is used to it,2,7
if you bought that drug filled presentation then have at it his words were not his and the hard parts were where he couldnt read,1,7
he called them illegals lol,5,7
2 minutes 8 seconds the potato clown is already lying cant listen to this idiot,1,7
i cant believe is can put a sentence together and that he said such bs,2,7
oh they pumped him up full of steroids and aderall,1,7
people that like being clapped at clapclap,2,7
if hes stopping shrinkflation on my dorito chips im all ears,2,7
he had energy here for sure,1,7
insurrectionist mike could your face say anything more,1,7
i didnt see the supreme court clapping much,5,7
he killed it,2,7
what a load a horse manure this speech was,3,7
look how the speaker sits ther and squirms lol,57,7
this guy is evil in every sense of the word,2,7
he definitely was on a happy pill other wise he would of slurp words i must say he was pretty good,2,7
im surprised there were so many commercials during the state of the union,3,7
yeaputin wants to march on parisdoes anyone really believe that shit,2,7
only one side of the house is applauding,2,7
what a weak speakerway over his headpresident,1,7
id love to know what drugs he is on,2,7
how much adderall was he on tonight,1,7
clapping for what treason and destruction,3,7

does he have eyes in there,2,7
senile my ass this guy is on fire,4,7
isnt it past his bed time,1,7
mike thomass snide looks just broadcast how maga cant wait to oppress us all,2,7
kamala climbed the ladder slurping down every white man in her path what a pig,1,7
mtg wearing her ferrari duds shouting like crazy is just laughable,49,7
more yelling more lies,2,7
the speaker would have wanted to stand up and give that well deserved ovation but afraid of trump who is watching and could reprimand him for it,4,7
why is mr sanders the only one wearing a fucking mask aint that mr sanders,1,7
geez that was hard to watch,1,7
notice moscow mike did not clap his hands when the president said american children can now drink from clean water pipes without risk of brain damage theres a reason for that,2,7
damn one hell of a speech diaper don must of been pulling on his hair my bad i meant his wig four more yrs,2,7
several psychiatrists have now stated that biden shows signs of being medicated during the state of the union address they say he appears to have been administered a drug stimulant to mask cognitive incline his speed and constant shouting during the speech despite having a microphone are indications of adderall or another amphetamine being used,2,7
why so many stand up ovations,1,7
he can still read when hes on meth,1,7
makes me ill just to listen to this piece of shit talk,1,7
why allow this he cant even speak correctly,10,7
bro he has laterally got an earpiece in,1,7
imagine clapping for theae clowns,1,7
kamala has never worked so hard clapping would be difficult for her especially on time,1,7
he is on crack,1,7
lock him up,1,7
i cant watch this clown,1,7
is he too political to clap,1,7
he deserved to be 2nd choice and chance,1,7
is harris sitting on needles always standing up,1,7
they must of pump him up with pills,1,7
i hope this is his last sotu,1,7
this was just a rally spewing good ideas that he knows hell never attempt to pass,1,7
i think he has an earpiece telling him every word he has to say pay attention to how he pauses after every 34 words,1,7
everything he says the opposite is true remember abbey gate,1,7
they literally decrease the significance sentiment for standing ovations each time they stand up,16,7
his opening line if i were smart id go home right now and then proceeds to talk for an hour and a half you got to love it,10,7
i like the speech but the soy clapping is unbearable kamala out here on leg day hittin a new pr,10,7
worthy head looks that of sataan i hv seen him somewhere in hell,1,7
how are people clapping for this idiot,1,7
im fairly sure god is angry and this man will be in eternal torment for all eternity,1,7
how do you clap for a guy whos destroying everyone in front of him its bizarre,9,7
love that he never mention whats his name,20,7
who and what was that guy yelling at about 5050,8,7
very awkward when kamala is giving the sign for standing ovation after every unintelligable sentence,1,7
hes lying about everything basically couldnt even get laken rileys name rifht rip,1,7
i cant believe ive witnessed a sotu mention more potato chips in the bag and it got a standing ovation,19,7
what a lit of bullshit this guy is a blatant liar he and his family are criminals and those clapping are also criminals unbelievable,1,7
all he did was spit lies lmao,1,7
look at the faces of audience and people behind him it remembers me on hans christian andersen this guy wrote a few years ago the excellent and timeless fairy tale the emperors new clothes,1,7
did he say to someone i didnt botch it did i when he came off stage someone said no more talking about cognitive decline well no just because he can get hopped up on some good drugs and somewhat perform for 1 hour does not make a leader even at that he still mumbled quite a bit and could barely stay on track,1,7
he is angry because neuland fked up big time,1,7
the speaker likes him too,9,7
spin doctor is looking bad,1,7
this dude is a joke,1,7
why did kamala harris bother sitting down she spent so much time jumping up to underscore bidens attempts at showing that he is still breathing that the effect was lost and her gymnastics became a distraction,1,7
reading what he is told to lie about,1,7
hitler used meth to give energetic speeches,1,7
how many times these people stand up lol its like a gym exercise,18,7
there is a man holding a sign with clap,18,7
i like to know what they pump him with where he doesnt blunder or forget,9,7
speaker looking like he see and smells,1,7
if i was smart i would go home now wow just wow we all know he aint the fella,1,7
hes an idiot,1,7
i heard he did really well but hes still dropping words and slurring a lot maybe thats good for him i dont know,1,7

clarence was a no show,14,7
looking at scotus sitting there makes me sick especially thomas,1,7
speaker mickey looking just like my boys years back whenever i restran them to the naughty corner for some misdeeds,14,7
u can say your gonna do all these things but we no it aint gonna happenthis is a jokeeveryone giving a standing ovation after every sentence is laughablebunch of narcissist in that room there,1,7
even one minute is too much,1,7
37 minutes into this looks like a shit show,1,7
an idiot leading the idiots,1,7
is it just me or does the speaker look like the keebler elf,13,7
nancy looks like she needs another bottle,1,7
how do people really believe hes doing amazing,1,7
kamala harris needs to just sit down sending the side to the puppets in the room the signal,1,7
can anyone else physically not watch this,1,7
what is the guy saying at 5050,1,7
marjorie reminds me of a cross between rick flare and david lee roth not in strength but in trees of looks yikes,1,7
hey just noticed the speaker of the house is not real hes a bobble head wow and we thought he was real,1,7

at least speaker whatshisname had the good grace to occasionally nod in agreement,16,7
this guy is such a bozo,1,7
fake talkshow ahhh lookin,1,7
kamala calm and confidentmikejohnson twitchy and uncomfortable,1,7
that was a breath of fresh air,11,7

he sounds good,1,7
wouldnt know the truth if it slapped him,1,7
i say this 1 2 3 4 and 5 everyone stands and claps,1,7
stupid seals clapping after every lying sentence,1,7
brandon used nearly the same speech from the past 3 sotusall hail the king of the libtards with nothing new to say fiery speech bahahahahahaha,1,7
the speaker of the house looks deeply troubled and ashamed he is in cahoots with the devil and he knows it,11,7
his headface doesnt even look real wtf,1,7
the glum christian sitting there shaking his head on helping the poor and taxing the wealthy what does he think jesus did,1,7
all these comments from woke boomers are hilarious,1,7
i cant count how many times i yelled at the screen sit tf down kamala,1,7
5041 that mentally deficient red baseball cap wearing marjorie has a very deep voice,1,7
this guy is a joke and not a good one he sucks,1,7
im not super crazy about his age but i do know hes got my back,15,7
omg kamala stared that dick down i didnt think she was that scary i may have to rethink shes not effin around,1,7
clapping seals waiting for a fish from their trainer,1,7
was that sanders the only one with a mask,8,7
what i call bidens lullaby he put the magats to sleep then he gave an unexpected godzilla minus one speech,1,7
his reference in his words my god can only be moloch or baal on whose altars pagans sacrificed their babies to,1,7
this man is such a liar,1,7
notice he didnt go home lmao,1,7
i cant stand listening to this man,1,7
never seen a circus like this before and briben as a leader of it makes it even better what a bunch of clowns,1,7
he is an idiot,1,7
why is he yelling the whole time,1,7
bidens hair is stuck on with double sided tape you can see a crescent shaped strip of it to keep the front of the comboverextensions down and looking like his hair is growing out from there instead of ending there hahahahai just noticed this makes sense since theres old foootage of him almost bald it woule look better bald lol,1,7
mikey looks so stupid sitting there trying to act like hes disinterested and unmoved hes doing a lousy job by the way,8,7
bad lip reading was better,1,7
awful angry vulgar man petty crook most likely took aricept to remain coherent,1,7
mike looks like he wants to crawl under a desk and hide from shame,1,7
has hunter been painting with all the termiol in his life the laptop all the undocumented millions of dollars his family has divied up his stepmom the evil witch of all biden trickery i bet all his current paintings are spectacular it would be nice to see him paint in his studio,1,7
the speaker of the house looks like the mad scientist that masterminds a plot to take over the worldwhere did they get pee wee from hes a terd,1,7
whoever embalmed him did a pretty good job,1,7
wow what a great man,1,7
word on the street is kh stood up 87 times,8,7
it already takes long enough for him to speak i wish they would stop making him pause and repeat himself by applauding and giving standing ovations every five seconds,20,7
is this snl,20,7
yes there is something to be said for wisdom and experience i know this as i am 70 and see life so differently now with much less insecurity and indecision as you age its a different world view i am finaly myself and sure of who that is and i am still young at heart,8,8
leave putin the hell alone you war mongering old dementia eating nobodytogether with your clown ass vp,3,8
the poor guy has dementia and should be at home relaxing he should not be put on media to make fool of himself his family should be protecting him from the real guy running the show telling biden what to say and take him home,1,8
hes 81 years old he absolutely killed this speech yes we have problems but at least hes doing some good unlike mr orangeman,3,8
when you look at the audience a main problem is clearage not that older people are not capable but how can the old and many times the old ways move a country forward it is time to stop being so afraid of the younger generation and possibly some fresh views and thoughts on how to move us as untied country forward,3,8
they pumped him full of dementia medication so he wouldnt confuse mexico with egypt again thats just 1 out of 1000 dementia laden gaffes in the past few months,1,8
seniors that,2,8
way to go grandpa 4 more years 4 more years,1,8
an skeptical aussie here sure doesnt look like a man suffering dementia,5,8
the old guy just done it power and as much luck as he needs to him,5,8
who do you want an elderly narcissist who cant make a coherent sentence indicative of crassness and stupidity and all whose thinking is about how to boost his ego or an elderly statesmen who has his finger on the pulse of the nation and speaks coherently and eloquently and in a measured way indicative of intelligence and actually thinking about things that matter and there sits the holy speaker listening to the intentions and celebrated actions of a president who believes in god and cares about the poor rather than the superrich with a pained expression on his face indicative of the inner conflict he must face of mounting guilt for his actions as speaker not matching up with any shred of christian decency,10,8
a very thoughtful and well considered old man he carefully chooses his words unlike the other guy who suffer verbal diarrhea,2,8
i dont understand why we keep making president joseph r bidens age an issue when him and donald trump are less than 5 years within age president biden turned 81 years old last november and trump should turn 79 years old this june and so the difference in age is not even 5 years long people should stop that nonsense and support a candidate for the content of his character not his age,265,8
its near to impossible for seniors to live on only social security abused women who raised fsmilies then divorced find themselves impoverished marginalized and alone if they have to change geographic regions to avoid their abuser this speech has some wonderful components but reality is that the high price of housing and transportation make life at sunsistence level a very difficult struggle to say the very least,1,8
the narrative that hes old is republican propaganda his mind is sharp i love hearing his progressive thinking biden is the man for this moment in time god formid the crazy trump,1,8
state of dementia,18,8
well well our dark brandon president was fully awake and spoke loud and clear and made the other side feel uncomfortable he might be old but he knows what he is talking about my grandpa was old but because of him i am who i am,6,8
at age 52 this is the first time i watched sotu address in its entirety historic,9,8
and people think his mind is too old fools,2,8
i would choose a goodhearted old man over a madman any day,11,8
theyre still saying this guy has dementia,104,8
angry old man fumbles and yells for an hour,1,8
wish he would have said yeah im old but i can still ride a bike my former counterpart can not,34,8
what a compelling state of the union speech did someone mention that the president has dementia he hit every nail on the head tonight 4 more years,7,8
this was an old man with dementia yelling at the sky,2,8
when you get to be my age certain things become clearer than ever example america is a nation that can be defined in a single word asdfoothasdhtin_uh_ftftfot,1,8
this doesnt look like a man who is claimed to have dementia those who are calling him that are the ones who have dementia,1,8
people who say he is too old need to watch this speech he just crushed it,1,8
im pushing 70 and capable in my field yet retired to focus on family community and enjoying retirement bidens commitment to usas growth prosperity health care and worldwide peace is inspiring thank you president biden,4,8
wow what an amazing speech definitely no sign of any dementia its infuriating the way trump and the maga crowd twist president bidens words and videos vote,18,8
mumbling sweating shaking forgetting pausing yelling lying blaming and staring off into space typical biden still embarrassing all of usthe light upstairs is just a dim flickering nightlight he should just go home and enjoy the months he has left in his old age instead of being put on display like a fool,1,8
the presidents mind does not seem at all affected despite his age as many gop leaders and theorist are saying,3,8
reminds me of the angry old man down the street,3,8
careful old man you might get a stroke,2,8
ill take this over 80 year old as president any day,3,8
difficult to watch stumbling bumbling lying yelling and screaming demented old man,1,8
watched this whole video and all i got from it was a bunch of old people giving a standing ovation to a fellow senior citizen every minute,2,8
his acumen and delivery is a contrast to all that talk about his senilityand too old to be in office talksmaybe he needs to fall down moreso that he can remain more intellectually sharper than persons in his age group,13,8
no nancy you wineo he was actually focused on completing the next sentence without having a dementia attack he couldnt be bothered to mention a beautiful young ladys name that is dead now because of his policy and then when mtg made him say it he couldnt even get her name correct huge surprise,1,8
hes old yes but hes proven time and to the us populace that hes still got it while that was going the other guy was ranting over and over on his little toy twitter,65,8
please god put trump back in office we could use a president that has common sense and doesnt have dementia,4,8
se3 hiw brite ans smart he is he has no signo of dementia he ralk normal not incoherent god bless mr biden god make him save our democracy,1,8
like watching a senior home very angry and depressing,1,8
he should stay home and enjoy his retirement,5,8
this is not a man who is too old unaware of his surroundings or unable to complete a sentence,125,8
nothing like watching a senile old folks home junkie lie for an hour and a half,1,8
just imagine if the msm at any given time mentioning bidens age include his extraordinary career whether we agree or not of him he is a treasure trove of knowledge its such a shame how we do see our elders this way but just imagine how different the narrative would be about him granted i dont want him to run again no elderly person should take on such a massive job like this however the msm even left leaning have continually pushed the hes old narrative for views which makes zero sense to me for views vs fighting for democracy,1,8
the old man kicked some ass plain and simple the gop has big a problem plain and simple trump smh,14,8
lets remember people any fluffs are due to president joe bidens stutter he controls it so well but its still there and can catch him out so give him credit for his mastery over his stutter and the fact he can deliver a coherent speech that is credible complex offers policy direction and good arguments unlike his predecessor who is showing genuine signs of dementia choose wisely choose wrong and you will put yourselves back in to last century and autocracy see how you like that the choice is yours dont be deceived by the other guy nz,1,8
this reminds me of the movie grumpy old men,5,8
biden 80 years old buffon dementia corruption no accomplishments in over 5 decades say it aint so joe,3,8
what an inspirational state of the union address the president literally swept the floor with the republicans and he let the supreme court justices know how he and the american people felt about so many recent decisions starting with rowe vs wade he certainly is no geriatric he is on fire the choice is so clear,3,8
well the man is certainly not getting senile i think he can handle another 4 years no problem what would be a problem would be having an equally old fellow with a crippling wisdom deficit,22,8
this is an angry old man hey rid of him,1,8
pretty presidential for an elderly man who allegedly has dementia,16,8
this man is still got it yes he is sharp enough to lead no visible signs of mental decline,14,8
how anyone could like this cranky old man is beyond me,1,8
what a pos this is what happens when a habitual liar gets alzheimers and dementia,1,8
first potus with dementia,1,8
just an angry old man total national disgrace,2,8
the guy is a decent competent grandpa light years above the raving dirty old lunatic he s running against,2,8
i cant believe he can speak so long without taking a sip of water and hes elderly,71,8
go biden,3,9
you can tell biden delivered a great speech from the sea of sulking republican faces in the seats lol wow they look pissed ahahahha,110,9
biden is the threat to the us along with all his traitor voters,1,9
biden is lying about everything business as usual and hes heavily drugged,1,9
theres hella biden bots on here,1,9
biden says raise the minimum wage while mike johnson and just about every blue suit and red tie republican scowl as they continue to make their 6 figures to poorly serve their constituency so friggen typical,1,9

god bless president biden,1,9
whoever says that biden is dulally simply has no eye to sea and no ears to hear if he was indeed dulally he obviously has that unique talent of a great leader of choosing great people to surround him and do the heavy lifting,1,9
tonight was the rebirth of another president give em hell joe in the footsteps of 1948 president harry s truman give em hell harry he famously said i dont give em hell i just tell the truth about them and to them it feels like hell joe biden gave the republicans hell tonight president biden just told the truth to congressional republicans and to some of them it felt like hell wake up friends trump is a bully and you need ot get off your knees republicans stop trump and refuse to nominate him,1,9
as obama once said and i wanna thank joe for not shooting anybody in the face he knew biden can get tough and rough if he needs to at his last white house correspondents dinner,1,9

dear americans this years election will be the most important election in history not only for america but also for the whole free world dont let trump fool you with his lies and with his hate he has no clue how democracy works and will put you back to the stone age so please make america great again and vote for biden,1,9
biden has brought america to its lowest levels of political intelligence poor old bastard ruined a once great nation fjb,1,9
as a citizen of the uk i find bidens speech both hopeful and uplifting he clearly is a leader for all time his views foresight are inspiring he needs that opportunity to lead the us for at least another term he may be old he may be slowing but thats not a reason at the moment to say that hes unfit to be president his mental acuity is still something to be reckoned with,1,9
biden is a angry lier he never mentioned the border or cops getting beat up he needs to go trump 2024,1,9
biden is a great president and i love the fbi,2,9
loved watching mike johnson sit there and squirm you go biden four more years competent intelligent knowledgeable and wise,71,9

watch biden speaking in his 40s tonight he showed that power and conviction,70,9
straight bot comments biden is losing,1,9
we just witnessed biden secure reelection excellent address we needed to hear biden represent and he did so in spades was funny to see republicans get pie in the face,1,9
ive grown to support biden and im not a democrat,4,9
high performance from president biden,2,9
hearing biden fact delivering excruciated the speaker by his expression,66,9
proud to have voted for biden and will again this year,15,9
joe biden is just sohuman and normal who knew wed get to the place where those things would be such assets,64,9
wow joe bidenwake them up,5,9
mr president biden shows his true colors mr president putin probably would have already shown his authority if not for mr president trump doing what he does best with respect to negotiations on peace and prosperity thank you mr president trump for taking time to calm mr president putin down some what president biden will not back down and will continue to feed children and families in whole in ukraine before he feeds his own children and family in the usa,2,9
biden is stronk,1,9
bravo you président joe biden of california usa,1,9
nelson mandela was the president of s africa at bidens age we hail him as a hero of justice and freedom put joe biden in that league also,21,9
trump is evil pray for biden,1,9
biden didnt say anything of substance,1,9
this is the biggest bunch of bull ive ever heard its a campaign speech he doesnt deserve to run the usa pro life abortion is painful to the dying baby why doesnt anyone think about that biden is disgusting,2,9
given his age and his speech impediment president biden gave a very powerful speech they all loved it there are only a few people in the room who truly dislike biden mostly kremlinpropagandist traitor green and some cowards if trump wasnt so bitter and frustrated and totally afraid of going to jail the world wouldnt be in such danger i would have given nicky a chance if she was on the ballot but now that its going to be what it is lets make sure trump stays a loser there must be no path for him he screwed us up with his inaction on covid hes just bad at everything it takes to be a good leader,1,9
trumps monkey sitting there squirmingmaga mike is a fool ridin with biden 4 more years go joe,1,9
this so quotable what a speech i wish you had condemned the genocide by israel as strongly as youve condemned the slaughter in russia but anyone who watches this in good faith then watches a gloating selfobsessed spiel by his predecessor and claims they think biden is worse needs a lobotomy,1,9
biden tiktok is behaving like snownden julian assange martin luther king jr aaron bushnell united states needs to stop these voice from ever appearing again,1,9
you know to all the americans who say joe biden isnt my president know that he absolutely is your president here is a state of the union for you in our country were aborting over a million babies every year we took bibles out of the class rooms we legalized the marriage of homosexuals were encouraging men to be women and promoting them in combat sports against actual women and promoting the idea of children to go under hormone therapy were legalizing marijuana so people can abuse themselves and those around them we shut down the entire country churches included and destroyed our economy left our border and voting system to that of a third world country and we do it all in the name of woke science and racial inequality that has no grounding on actual science and benefits not a single person of color in our country and what did you all do when it was happening stood by and watched joe biden is your president and hes your punishment romans 131,1,9
bidens old age is better than trumps stupidity,1,9
biden made the us great again the most powerful president the us has ever had highest growth rate since 40 years practically no unemployment anymore record low inflation and salaries increasing us taking the lead from china again on innovation and production,3,9
welcom you président joe biden,1,9
i am not a us citizen but i have to applaud president biden in delivering such a great speech may god bless him with another 4 yesrs,1,9
biden did well with his speech that is coming from an australian,23,9
president joe biden does have his weaker moments as does every human being if in doubt look yourself in the mirror especially on a saturday nonetheless if anyone realistically without prestigious contemplates this speech as one coming from an old and feeble man then heshe is either disillusioned or ill conceived through deception or self inflicted disbelief period the us and the world needs stability and conviction not growing disparity and conflict each vote cast in the us is not just a vote within the us but a vote to a world in which the us leads can lead and should lead with its allies for a betterment of human race history will judge this comment long after we are long gone god bless america and its allies in what is to endure in the 21st century henceforth,1,9
big up mi president joe biden god bless our president biden,15,9
how can any decent human being listen to president biden and think no ill go for the other guy who quotes hitlera few words biden 2024,8,9
president obama once exclaimed that you should never underestimate bidens ability to mess things up google it,3,9
absolutely fantastic president biden wow,1,9
im very proud to call joe biden our president,1,9
nothing positive about bidens speech it was lousy like the past 4years,1,9

thank you biden,3,9
biden is such a cuck,1,9
canada is watching thank you president bidenfour more years,7,9
anyone else find it strange that biden is able to get through his speech without forgetting his lines or zoning out stumbling to get his words out as in many other televised speeches where is this burst of competence coming from asking for a friend,4,9
biden speaks and the wisdom enshrined in the entire speech is what matters there are visible indications of victory for the democrats,1,9
was never much of a biden fan prior to his presidency but have so come to admire this guy what a champ an amazing speech mr president youre doing great and thank you for setting that wonderful positive example to democracies and elderly citizens everywhere a bright shining and stark alternative to the messages of fear division and hate from the repugnant insecure loser who wants to be king the cesspool across the aisle that cower before him and the ugly damaged souls aligned with them,80,9
go president biden thank u for fighting for usa and democracy,1,9
id be a winnernot really joe biden,3,9
where has this version of joe biden been hiding if he can keep this same energy throughout the election he might be a chance of stopping small hands trumpy,8,9
now that is how a president talks and acts because joe biden is presidential,21,9

i thought people were saying biden was old and losing it or something thats not what i saw here,222,9
biden failed to implement the economic policies he promised during his first campaign then brought those back out for this sotu as if we can trust him to start fighting for them now all of a sudden he hasnt beeen fighting for those policies in his first term at all then he praised israel more and didnt call for a ceasefire just because he was completing sentences tonight doesnt make this speech a win,1,9

anyone who thinks biden is too old needs to watch this and listen to the progressive policies for a better future and if you stil have doubts i challenge you to stand for the 90min duration just as biden did i challenge republicans to take their share of credit for the border bill and pass it as a bipartisan step forward,13,9

biden 2024,23,9
biden has been chipped,1,9
biden is correct freedom and democracy are under attack at home but not by a foreign invader it is under attack from the biden administration after biden failed to create a ministry of truth he used his own dept of justice to attack his political opponent former president donald trump once again his democrat sycifiants judges and attorney generals tried but failed to remove trump from state ballots now this senile old man is going after trumps fortune while these democrat judges may have won some initial monetary judgements few if any will stand up to an appeal giving this administration another four years to sow division amongst its citizens will be catastrophic for our country,1,9
biden4president2024,1,9
great job president biden keep us moving forward,1,9
we appreciate president biden is still fighting for democracy and freedom for the country at his age he is well qualified for this position he could have a peaceful life but he chose to put country interest priority its respectful,3,9
so many bots commenting on this no one wants biden to lead the usa,1,9
this video proves that republicans dont love america heartbreaking that they dont support anything positive from joe biden,1,9
this was not a state of the union address he hardly mentioned america or how we are probably bcz its doing so badly economy border government spending in foreign aid is out of control spending on illegal border crossers is out of control we give them more than we give our veterans its sick biden dared to say he wants to launder even more money through the ukraine we already pay all their ems we pay all police fire we pay the pensions of the people who live there what about americans i dont mean the ones that crossed the border this past few years we all know hes spending multi millions if not billions im sure by now on the 9 million that we know of who crossed in the last 35 years drug cartels are operating in all 50 states now i wouldnt be surprised if biden was making a commission he sure knows they charge 8 thousand to get a person across the border whats his cut i wonder maybe hunters next laptop will tell us that biden constantly says how he hates half of the americans how we are no dam good in his eyes he wonders why he cant win our vote lol he talks about the riot on jan 6 yes it was terrible no worse then the riot hamas supporters just had at the capital everyone on jan 6 was unarmed you cant over throw a government when everyone is unarmed hell biden himself said it would take more than an ar15 to over throw the government bcz they have tanks planes nukes so how unarmed does he think anyone was a serious threat it was a dam riot stop acting like we are stupid dont know that no one was charged with insurrection not one person just trespassing for the most part the riot was terrible yes but nothing like the civil war where millions died or like pearl harbor stop thats so disrespectful to those who truly lived or died in those the riot was as bad as the summer riots well no not really bcz police stations court houses where actually set on fire people where not just rioting over that summer they used lasers to blind cops they threw bricks at officers those in the crowd they froze water bottles hit officers in the head face with them that was far far worse jan 6 officers waved people in at first the video shows they all followed cops stayed inside the red ropes ive watched hours of footage it was when police began launching flash bangs into the crowd just outside the capital one officer tried to stop it on the video he said doing this will be like stirring up a hornets nest the other cop said thats the idea one flash bank exploded in a mans face ripping the side of his face off i saw it thats when people got angry combative so they wave them in fbi capital police about 200 they say were dressed as trump supporters some were in the capital prior to letting real supporters in the video shows once they had them inside they sent flash bangs into the crowd angering the crowd getting the response they wanted nancy pelosi who refused the national guard trump offered oddly nancy had her own film crew consisting of her daughter several others in order to document the insurrection she famously said to the camera she was going to punch a sitting president video shows her camera crew which was not normal for her to have there press yes her own crew documenting the day no it was a set up trump told supporters in his speech go to the capital to peacefully patriotically let your voices be heard as he said that the first group of people were already being waved in by capital police the people who went in were not even there for the speech they already were at the capital ashley babbit an unarmed veteran of our armed forces was gunned down with no warning she was unarmed not a threat she was hardly 54 the officer who murdered ashley an unarmed woman veteran was not fired not tried like the officer who had his knee on george floyds shoulder blade as george odd on enough fentynl to kill 11 people the coroner said that cop we put away however this also unarmed woman not posing a threat with out any verbal warning like get down or ill shoot police officer no he hid behind a side door in the video you can see the barrel of the gun pointing toward the group of unarmed people trying to push open the outer doors in the hall ashley was not pushing as a witness next to her would say she was just caught up in the crowd as they pushed forward they pushed her forward the shot with no warning rang out entering ashley dropping her immediately those near her tried to render aid the officer who murdered her did not come forward at all she died on the floor in the capital that she served in the military for the man who murdered her not fired but labeled a hero which is so shameful her poor family she deserved better from a country she believed in her murderer deserved to stand trial just as much as the cop involved in george floyds death was thats what would have been fair if we still had the america where lady justice was blindfolded had a scale sadly tho lady justice no longer has a blindfold at all she peeks out if youre not a democrat well then justice is not for you in fact lady justice will be used to get you if you dare not be a dem democrats murdered committed arson tore cities apart it was reported as mostly peaceful as the cities burned to the ground stores were looted public donated funds that kamala harris herself donated to until no cash bail was put in place so they could get back out there burn cities dems actually cheered that on saying they shouldnt stop harris said conservatives have one riot its ok to murder one who was totally unarmed unaware a cop even was there pointing a gun at her she had no chance at all in ny donald trump was fined 350 million climbing over 80 grand a day in interest for doing something every developer does so says kevin oleary many others no one lost money no victim in fact the bank would like to do more business it was good for the bank for ny there were no damages in history no one has been charged for this then on top of that to go for 350 million we no longer have a true justice system at all if it can be used like this against political rivals whose next we should all be afraid no one should do business in ny after this the risk is far too high other states are more rational dont use the law to grind an axe or get even thats not america its sad that it is ive lost hope in our country then fanni as well went to dc met with biden before going after trump again a which hunt its like stalin show me a man ill show you a crime they campaigned on finding something to prosecute him for that is a disgrace not how the law should be allowed to work whose next so when republicans are in the white house can we start finding some crime that no one has ever been charged with just to get our opponent thats just it they know we wont bcz we respect the rule of law love america im sick over what has happened the rot the one sidedness both in reporting in mainstream media the law ashley babbit deserved justice instead her mother is getting arrested its a very sad time to be an american my father fought as a marine in ww2 im glad hes not here to see all of this what became of the country he loved the party he use to believe in i dont like donald trump personally i do know i my family was far better off when he was president i had no debt i didnt even have credit cards i never needed any the last 4 years are the worst i have 4 credit cards bcz i couldnt make it with out them for the first time in 59 years jimmy carters time wasnt even as bad as it is now it has to stop we need a border money to the ukraine needs to end all the gov spending making inflation worse needs to stop there is no magic wand but what has been happening the last 4 years is all wrong i know this was long i know no one read it but i honestly just had to vent that bogus non state of the union attack on half the country president who claimed he was going to bring unity just keeps sewing more division hatred with every single speech hes the worst he has to go really they all need to go we need to start over i swear just a whole new blank slate start with term limits no lobbyists no inside trading just bcz youre in the government its not ok in fact it makes it worse,1,9
bidens yelling doesnt make him presidential squinting his eyes the whole timestruggling with word and talking so fast you cant understand a lot of what he said unprofessional,1,9
if anybody says biden is old look at his speech not even many young people could deliver such a speech without reading most of it,151,9
biden comes across as an angry man in this state of the union interesting tone he chose to take,3,9
i have never seen joe biden coherent i wonder what they have him on,3,9
thank god for joe biden freedom long live our democracy,3,9
i am only 22 minutes in to what has to be the brightest and most historic address why because biden doesnt fear trump he is a courageous man what strikes me the most is that the happy eyes of all of those that are hearing the truth versus the sycophants that are for the most part wearing trump suits who are smug and slimy mike johnson especially he looks like a wind up toy who needs his big daddy to come and rewind his clock i am so happy for this moment and also so proud to not be an american,1,9
biden is a segregationistand yet he calls trump racist what a total disgracethis was not a state of the union speech it was a political ad trump 24,1,9
biden just handed the rebublicans a can of whoopass johnson should leave if he doesnt want to be a part of keeping america great biden spoke greatness and all the speaker did was sit and shake his head to appease his masters,1,9
biden saying putin is spreading chaos throughout europe hes a liari live in europe no one is scared of putin we know he is not going to invade europe dont believe this liarhe said this garbage as soon as putin went into ukraine that he was going to turn his sights on europe no hes notputin has kept the war isolated in some areas of ukraine hes not coming for the rest of europe,1,9
biden was deemed too senile to stand trial let that sink in,7,9
everything biden says the opposite is true its opposite day,1,9
the only one bearing the truth about january 6th is the fake president biden,1,9
absolutely fantastic job done tonight president biden vote blue,19,9
im so proud of biden a president for american people,1,9
joe biden is a criminal and a liar,2,9
president trump trolls joe biden with snapchat filters following his disastrous state of the nation address,1,9
speaker maga mike feeling sick sitting behind biden and i am loving it,19,9
the guy in backs expressions say it all biden needs to go,2,9
biden is a treasonous tyrant who should be imprisoned remember your oath of office how many of you actually have an oath of office when you own the media and the state dept you own information lemmings of the left you should question more with less destruction of public and private property,1,9
50yo lifelong democrat here will not be voting for biden due to his antidemocratic manipulation of the primary and his historic decision to deny early secret service protection to rfk jr that is a real banana republic move and unworthy of the usa btw you might be aware that kenedys have a bit of a history of needing protection,1,9
biden did an amazing job spoke so many truths to power love it 4 more yrs,6,9
very proud of my president joe biden eloquent savy highly diplomatic and accomplished i definitely want 4 more years,6,9
brilliant speech my p biden now watch citizen trumpf moan and groan about himself vote blue for our country,1,9

biden did better than i thought he would everybodys expectation was very low but he exceeded them his energy level was high,34,9
not the time to be making fun of biden we need to be building him up instead if we lose our democracy you will have contributed to it,6,9
does joe biden or trump talk about the issues in our us the debt our homelessness our high prices or its all divisions,2,9

hope and opportunity and democracy god bless biden and america,1,9
president biden you nailed it,9,9
why dont the republicans stand a clap biden is talking about americas success dont the republicans like america it is so disrespectful that they sit on their hands and engage in making us as americans look divided not united this should not be accepted behavior during a presidential speech and it goes both ways,1,9
doesnt matter what you say p biden is for the people he wants the best for all,2,9
president biden brought the hammer and strength,1,9
biden blahblah blah nothing but mumbojumbo pandering to a crowd who simply want to hear anything to get them riled up nothing will come of the empty rhetoric the richer will continue to get the lions share and the poor gets what the poor always get screeeewed,1,9
mike johnson whats wrong so many times biden said awesome things about what is happening and what will happen he said good things for regular people and you did not even applaud or acknowledge so cheap and petty you can do better mike johnson,34,9
putin is voting for biden httpsyoutubesylqnxnunlcfeatureshared,1,9
sometimes i like clicking on cnn videos and reading the comments from bidens out of touch supporters thinking hes doing such a great job,1,9
i have to say mr biden you really hit home on this speech i have listened to mr t words and he has never hit home as you did when i watched this i to have listened to his lies and favoritism to the wealthy thank you for being for the people instead of for the wealthy and trying to make america great the right way thank you mr biden you really hit home where it was needed,9,9
this biden is full of bs,1,9
joe biden are dictator,1,9

help joe biden,6,9
all those republicans sitting there refusing to stand and acknowledge the advances that have been made because of president biden,6,9
bs biden still cranking out the bs the biggest joke of a president ever trump 2024,2,9
i saw this live last night and my creatorcreators bidens speech was inspiring im so damn proud to have voted for joe biden and kamala harris and im doing it again vote blue save democracy save america,35,9
key points to take away 1 joe biden is using the state of union during the election year to boost his momentum going into the election and to push his poll numbers 2 he is not serious on putting pressure on putin and will not actually due anything to deter him but rather get america to rally in basically anti communism and we saw what that led to 3 its simply to bash trump like biden hate trump like trump hate biden its exactly what this was 4 despite the agendas going on and the disingenuous undertone of biden hes extremely extremely coherent for once good on him,1,9
love it or hate it and i cherish this moment i love it mr president biden in time of contemporary sotu in which america face its utmost danger in our experiment of democracy of djt return to the people house thats our white house expletive you fk djt,1,9
i was just running the mental picture of trump up there bragging about how great trump is spewing hate and childish innuendo then i snap back to this reality and i feel assured that our futures are not lost i can say in this moment that i am a joe biden fan and i believe he can bring it home besides joe being stand alone good the alternative is very dark go joe biden go blue house in 2024 senate 60 in 2024 just love him calling out the justices of the supreme court,2,9
note the speaker never or rarely cheered the positive goals of biden he shakes his head all the time knowing that he and his team are heading for disaster,1,9
mike shakes his head agreeing with what president biden says then holds up every bill made in the house hoping his kiss ass pal trump will get elected,1,9
i was going to vote for trump was im voting for you sir vote for biden,1,9
president biden is on his best game he was strong clear smart to the point on all policies and 101 accurate on everything i heard him say cant get any better than this im a lot younger than him and i wish i had his his speed of thought very very very impressive,19,9
biden still doesnt get it everyone in that room are the ones who dont know what the american people are going through biden doesnt know what we pay for gas and food because none of them live in out world liberals really believe biden is telling the truth but the ones biden is always putting down everyone who wants trump to change the country around and all we want we just want to be able to tell our kids the dream isnt over and we know it has to change because our kids dont even know why we are allowing people who dont belong here why is it we get taxed when they broke the law they work and everyone is working hard as we can and still they have no money left they cant even afford to even rent a house and nobody but the rich is saying its ok and biden is doing a great job all the things he wants america to believe and says we are living better today if he only had to buy gas and see what hes done and obama care sucks because they deside if they pay for it or not conservatives have to join together and make sure the world they are living in they can keep it but they cant out vote ushe still wants to help ukraine but hes forgotten about his own people everything he talks about is what our children want but they cant buy a home and russia wants to end what ukraine is doing we should stand with russia because the president of russia told everyone why he has to win ukraine kills and puts christians in jail just because they are christians and you dont think god doesnt hear them but they will have the right to be a christian if russia wins but we want to fight against god he still wants abortion but god is show everyone that he is going to end what biden is doing our sons are so close to being in a war and war means every son we send some want come back alive because you die in wars all his words meant nothing to regular people but its in gods hand nowgod will choose who it will be so be it,1,9

what a difference to listen to someone who has something to say instead of whining four more years for biden the rebublicans are just so partisan just sitting there even when joe says he will reduce prescription charges they dont want to help anyone other than billionaires,2,9
id rather vote 4 jesus than trump or biden,1,9

wheres all the senility and dementia biden seems in command and on top of his game to me givem hell joe,25,9
amazing state of the union biden came in rolling to remind america what its about by being the best place to invest and being the best what a person running for office has to have to lead the way finally great to see life in him again and not a sad baddered old man,2,9
thats right president biden well done president biden harris four more years 2024,8,9
great speech president biden has struggled with a stuttering impediment his whole life and that hes ascended to the position that hes in now is a testament to what america is vote blue inclusion always,2,9
we will not all agree on everything i think president biden could do a lot better with student loan issues the border and the economy hes still the better option than trump mr trump does not have the emotional maturity nor the intelligence to run this country,1,9
very strong powerful speech im impressed please vote for 4 more years with biden thanks,1,9
biden has so many years of experience thats why he was put with obama obama was new and biden had been working for a lifetime,33,9
in the end nothing remains but strong words all leaders of declining empires faced this moment but strong words didnt help them and they will not help joe biden joe biden must really be desperate seeing how all his plans in the last two years miserably failed presidents roosevelt and lincoln will turn in their graves hearing the speech of joe biden and seeing what he has done to the united states victoria nuland just left the sinking ship when will joe biden or will he bring nuklear armageddon to the rest of the world,1,9
biden raises the democratic standard,2,9
what a very beyond serious time with such evil in high places biden is a vile excuse for a leader promoting lies and corruption while he mocks righteous people,1,9
biden offers abortion war inflation and ivasion at the border,2,9
two minutes into his speech and he is talking about war that is not even on american soil and yet is absolutely insistent on funding with 80 billion dollars so far while the rest of europe has only contributed a trickle in the bucket so its okay to drain american coffers but not okay to demand that everyone pull their weight especially if the threat is happening in their own backyard and if biden feels indignant about russia invading another country then why has he allowed 6 million illegal aliens so far into the united states and refuse to enforce border laws and security a staggering number thats unprecedented in history i dont care much for trump because hes a clown but biden is an overseasoned politician who has made an overextended career out of politics like pelosi mcconnell and others and whos already oversold his principles and ideas to the public but then what no big reforms no outstanding bills in his name no civic rights causes and certainly no big econ0mic gains that translate into peoples lives a grand speech delivered at the state of the union does not change the fact that grocery prices have surged 20 since 2021 and inflation peaked at 7 the highest ever in us history,1,9
up mr president biden you show the haters and the country you can do it4 more years,6,9
what biden should have said to putin was disarm your weapons or russia will be obliterated this war wouldnt have even started the usa military alliance of nato is 10x strength of russia russia is not even a blip on the radar in comparison,1,9
haha i heard that guy yell joe biden sucks,1,9
you president biden are the best president and you must be president again beyond 2024 you have fulfilled your promises where maga didnt ruin progress trump will ruin america and global democracy,1,9
biden threatens supreme court justices to their faces in state of the union address,2,9
joe biden the only threat to democracy letting immigrants in to kill american citizens while he passes out money to other countries calls that patriotic he sounds so fake spews bullshit talk about americans and how much rhey have suffered with your criminal decisions,1,9
biden will kill us all with his fuckery,1,9
you can tell how well the speech went by the number of personal insults thrown at joe biden in these comments,31,9
joe biden and his followers also known as american communists are destroying america from within change my mind,1,9
lol to the maga and liberal haters biden not my first pick for potus should have done a mic drop on the part of being the first president who was vice president to the nations first black president and now the first president of the first black woman vice president lol now that is history,1,9
im canadian so i dont have a horse in this race per se but i am a woman a mother three times over so when i witness a leader stand up to those scotus attendees to protect roe v wade it gave me goosebumps joe biden has the benefit of 40 years in government he knows what hes doing clearly as your country is thriving right now so why in gods name would anyone consider a convicted rapist whos currently under indictment for 91 other crimes against your country seriously though trump has failed at running a casino for goodness sake not to mention filed bankruptcy 4 times so why have him at the helm at all btw joe biden is stronger than orange jesus will ever be vote blue save democracy,2,9

biden isnt too old he just likes to do a constant imitation of the old guy character that tim conway used to play on the carol burnette show httpsyoutubezbpvwej5xwsicpmcmxdmm8ij8x0,1,9
cnn is the worst news unless you love biden other then that no one has respect for cnn any more,2,9

its mind boggling that some of the middle class and donald trump could compete with biden biden seems actually genuine why would struggling lower class back trump the world we live inlol,1,9
biden spoke very well 4 more years of biden will be good if trump wins our democracy will end he only cares about himself he lies constantly and aligns himself with putin china and north korea that cannot be good he will allow putin to take over ukraine biden is a normal person not a narcissist he cares about poor and middle class and tries to pass bills that help the situation at the border but he is blocked by republicans he tries to help israel and the palestinians at the same time which is a very difficult process,1,9
the president biden did excellent job,1,9
the performance of joe biden is stunning surely hes won the 2024 election this speech makes trump shake its not a walk over,1,9
i wish biden would go away,1,9

good job biden a decent mana honest man a working man god fearing man trump the swamp is totally opposite you know what too do vote blue trump thinking scamming republicans and tricking his way to the white house going to save him from being held accountable for his evil corrupt sins,1,9
what a filthy liar poser joey biden is,2,9
in one powerful speech biden demonstrates why he is a great statesman and a true leader the contrast with his opponent could not be any starker,18,9
he has the ineptitude to say that he remembers being horrified when rfk sr was assassinated while running for president while simultaneously denying rfk srs son rfk jr secret service protection while he runs for president over and over and over and over rfk jr has asked more than 4 times his dad was assassinated his uncle was assassinated who his family worked with to get civil rights malcolmdr king were assassinated and yet still biden denies rfk jr robust security its not about winning and losing the presidency its about ensuring the survival of the people that strive to be a conduit for the american people so that the american people have the opportunity to vote for their prefered candidate the granting of secret service protection has become a formality at this point nikki hailey just dropped out of the republican race and even she had it its about ensuring we the people have the opportunity to have what we want not about ensuring the second term of the incumbent for this and many others biden is a humiliating and outoftouch disgrace,2,9
anyone but biden 2024 hes created record inflation interest rates food cost housing cost etc,1,9
democrats wreck the country and then yell about what we need to do to fix it trump does more good for this country asleep than this guy does awake you suck biden,1,9
if i was in the us id be voting for biden for sure,18,9
are you really american citizens look at what joe biden has done and continues to do for all of you absolutely nothing look at this number just because of the opening of the us border 33000 assaults 3000 robberies 6900 burglaries 7500gun crimes 4300 sex crimes 1600 kidnappings and 1700 murders and assassinations data collected last week note that i dont talk about the possible crimes of the joe biden family where whistleblowers witnesses documents emails bank accounts cell phone records and other evidence about corruption activities receiving bribes tax evasion money laundering footloose schemes illegal business with foreigners and other terrible crimes in which he and his family are involved,1,9
america needs president biden right now you are watching a real president in action god bless president biden save america,1,9
oh how we are waiting presidental debates between trump and biden imagine trump high on valium goofing off the usual amount of his bs and biden responding with actual facts that will be the political comedy show of the century of thousands of millenia,2,9
the president does not possess the authority to directly overrule or overturn a decision made by the supreme court hence biden cannot reverse the decision re roe v wade,2,9
i greatly admire president joe biden,2,9
i am in chicago a social worker at toxicology helping the drug addict and i can tell you i recognize biden was on speed and cocaine just once is ok but stop there all this,2,9
thats our president biden we love you and we will vote like we depend on it vote blue all the way for our democracy and freedom,5,9
this is the biden we love,39,9
trump will proceed that bid left behind,1,9
just got done vomiting from biden speaking trump 2024,2,9

biden freaking killed it so much for owning the libshe owned the repubs they are so pathetic it even seems like at times maga mike was having an existential crisis vote blue 2024,2,9
four more years save america vote biden,38,9
biden and his admin worst ever in our history jan 6 was a set up by dems and they know it they keep bringing it up in hopes the people will believe it was trump who orchestrated it i have eyes to see and hears to hear and see through the biden admin lies but cheating lies and deception is all they have they dont know what honesty and integrity is they see position wealth and power only people are just pons in their game they want the middle class completely gone so they can have only the poor and the wealthy they want roman empire days where they control everything sad so many dont have a clue to what the future is going to be not just in america but the world nothing will be free not yourself or anything around you you will be like a robot doing what your told and if you dont obey you will be killed our country was founded on by gods principles and when you take him out you will get what you ask for hopefully we will get a reprieve having trump in office because if he doesnt get in our country will fall faster and be gone forever bible tells us whats coming but some people will not seek to know the truth until its too late,1,9
i dont support putin i want to see joe biden help our democracy,25,9
biden you should be ashamed of yourself for what you have done to the working class people of this country you are worthless,1,9
biden is a traitor and has sold out the american people for his own personal gain under his watch over 10 million illegal aliens have come into americathats just the ones we know about millions more we have no idea who they truly are many are from china and the middle east his getting american military killed due to his incompetence in afghanistan is unforgiving hundreds of billions of american taxpayer dollars for ukraine israel and illegal aliens we have american veterans and american homeless that can use those billions illegals killing americansjob of the president is to protect americanshe has failed propping up the ukraine social security system when our own will run out of money by 2034 biden is a sellout,2,9
what a breath of fresh clean air thank you president biden so tired of trump crying about a rigged election and vomiting hate,1,9
1030 biden stung the hell out of the right wing supreme court justices right in their faces woo wee 2131 the days when trickle down economics are over biden stung reagans ass in the grave splendid 2547 is lauren bobert itching for another line of coke 4700 after squirming for 45 minutes during most of the address speaker johnson reluctantly stands up to applaud the late john lewis after all the republicans are trying to peel off black voters from biden theyve got to pretend that they respect voting rights despite plans to do away with them biden had a good speechwriter i didnt agree with all of his points i dont like his foreign policy but im mostly aligned with his domestic agenda the old man is sharper than what his detractors say hes getting my vote,2,9
so instead of talking about the welfare of americans he starts with ukraine joe biden is the best president ukraine has even had,24,9
how can this many sane individuals think that president biden is capable and competent to do his job maybe they arent so sane there was a time i used to say the same thing about president trump now i say hey dems you give me biden i give you trump,2,9
biden is exactly what an american president should be and has been before donald trump hearing him speak the truth in his sotu speech with conviction character and class shows a man who uses his intelligence and respect for others to lead us against the evils of the world i was moved to tears as i listened i am so thankful we now have a president who still believes in our country biden fights for american democracy and common decency,2,9
not sure what i was expecting but damn the boy done good anyone that still says biden is senile hasnt seen this,1,9
if we get biden for four more years we will be screwed,1,9
i have never been more proud of my vote for president joe biden he was the only choice possible from my democrat point of view and still is,5,9
biden is the leader of the dumbacrit party dumbhypocritdumbacrit,2,9
biden 2024,2,9
go home biden no one wants you hows hunter btw is he clean nowadays,1,9
americans looked for biden the unifier to lay out his plans to fix the border the economy and our international affairs instead we got a hyperpartisan angry grandpa speech where he blamed everything in the last 3 years on trump thank god we wont hear this ass clown again until september when he yells again at the dnc convention fjb,1,9
both parties are straight trash and biden is liar he hasnt done nothing who tf wants work as a security guard they whole life people have dreams and goals stop spending money to other countries and its just not ukraine but other countries we need to help america first why is immigrants being taken care of but not the american people smh,1,9
bravo well done biden,10,9
djt is a traitorous liar and biden showed us he is a true american he cares he gets shit done and is respected nobody respects djt bc he doesnt deserve it djt belongs in prison,2,9
im impressed with what president biden has accomplished much more than i thought was possible with the starting point hes found ways to deliver when obstructed by the chaos party i was already voting for him and still this sotu was touching optimistic and inspiring the way he handles the riffraff is wildly entertaining too,5,9
bidens speech was feisty so says the democrats then maybe he can testify with special counsel about his stolen classified documents,1,9
i watched this speech live and watched it five times afterfor some reason biden still got it he nailed it,2,9
biden is a pathological liarhe caused the border crisishe caused the wars he caused the recession he is an ass clownby far the worst president in historyeven worse than carterhe belongs in jail with the rest of the biden crime family,1,9
