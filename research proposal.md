# Leveraging Machine Learning to Analyze YouTube Comment Sentiment and Engagement in Response to Political News: A Case Study on Trump and Biden

### **Abstract**

This study aims to investigate the relationship between political events and public response on YouTube by analyzing engagement metrics and comment sentiment. Specifically, it focuses on content related to Donald Trump and Joe Biden, using data science techniques to understand how different types of political news influence viewer engagement and sentiment. By applying machine learning models, the research seeks to predict engagement patterns and identify key factors driving public discourse.

### **Introduction**

**Intention of the Research:**
The research aims to explore how YouTube, as a platform for political discourse, reflects and influences public opinion through viewer engagement and comment sentiment. The study specifically targets videos related to Donald Trump and Joe Biden, given their prominence in contemporary political discussions. By leveraging data science methods, the research intends to provide insights into the dynamics of online engagement in response to political events, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of digital media's role in shaping public opinion.

### **Literature Review**

The intersection of social media, political communication, and public opinion has been extensively studied, with YouTube emerging as a significant platform for political discourse. Previous studies have shown that video content and viewer comments can reflect and even sway public sentiment. However, there is a gap in research applying advanced machine learning techniques to systematically analyze these dynamics, particularly in the context of high-profile political figures like Trump and Biden.

### **Research Objectives**

1. To analyze the sentiment of YouTube comments on videos featuring Trump and Biden.
2. To predict viewer engagement (e.g., view count, likes, comments) using machine learning models based on video characteristics and comment sentiment.
3. To explore the impact of specific political events on engagement and sentiment.

### **Research Questions and Hypotheses**

- Research Questions:
  1. What patterns can be identified in the sentiment of YouTube comments on political videos about Trump and Biden?
  2. How effectively can machine learning models predict engagement metrics based on sentiment analysis and video metadata?
- Hypotheses:
  - H1: Political events involving controversy or significant public interest will generate higher engagement and more polarized comment sentiment.
  - H2: Machine learning models can accurately predict engagement metrics using features derived from comment sentiment and video metadata.

### **Methodology**

- **Design**: Quantitative analysis using NLP and machine learning.
- **Data Collection**: The study will collect data from YouTube's API, focusing on videos related to Trump and Biden. The dataset will include video metadata (e.g., titles, descriptions, tags), engagement metrics (view counts, likes, dislikes, comments), and the content of viewer comments.
- Data Analysis:
  - **NLP and Sentiment Analysis**: Comments will be processed using NLP techniques to extract sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) and analyze linguistic features.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Develop features from video metadata and comment sentiment for input into machine learning models.
  - **Machine Learning Models**: Apply and compare various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks) to predict engagement metrics.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics such as RMSE, accuracy, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

### **Expected Results**

The research is expected to demonstrate that significant political events lead to increased engagement and more polarized comment sentiment. Machine learning models are anticipated to show high accuracy in predicting engagement metrics based on sentiment and metadata features. These findings will provide valuable insights into the relationship between political content and public response on digital platforms.

### **Type of YouTube Content/Data Used**

The study will focus on:

- **Videos**: Content related to political news involving Donald Trump and Joe Biden, including speeches, interviews, debates, news reports, and commentary.
- **Metadata**: Information such as video titles, descriptions, tags, upload dates, and engagement metrics (view counts, likes, dislikes, comments).
- **Comments**: Viewer comments on these videos, which will be analyzed for sentiment and linguistic patterns.

This research proposal provides a comprehensive plan to explore the interaction between political events, media representation, and public response using advanced data science and machine learning techniques.
