i didnt see the full room come together not once not at protecting children from lead in their water not at stopping drug traffickers not at advancing cancer research we need to be exclusively voting for people who will work together against the problem rather than people who obstruct everyone different from them at every opportunity,1024
johnson looked like he was sitting outside the principals office waiting to get paddled,690
you cant love the country only when you win,676
you cant love your country only when you win so true,622
anybody notice how many times speaker mike johnson nodded agreeing with a lot of things biden said peace from australia,527
the middle class built america unions built the middle class absolutely,488
canadian here just watched this i hear a lot of talk about your president having a failing mind he was pretty sharp tonight i think you should be proud of him seems like hes doing a lot of good things for you,486
for future scholars it starts at 2645,445
biden begins speaking at 2650 for those not here for the pomp and circumstance,443
mike johnson is visibly uncomfortable as he knows djt is watching his reaction,398
that room is littered with enemies of the state,390
his speech is really bothering johnson he has no excuse for what he is allowing in the house,376
the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears it was their final most essential command george orwell 1984,369
we can either fight to fix the border or we can fix the border,367
im not a neurologist but im fairly certain that someone with dementia wouldnt be able to deliver a speech like that to get an example of a speech by someone that actually has it just watch literally any speech that donald trump ever gives,358
304 how in all thats holy did george santos manage to weasel his way into the chamber for the sotu he was expelled does he not have any shame,306
i see a future where we defend america not diminish it,290
joe biden said things tonight that literally boosted my support of his presidency and im a person who did not want him as the democratic candidate in 2020 he is the first president ive ever heard tell the truth that trickle down economics was a failure and he wasnt going to do that anymore,281
the best part is where he let the supreme court justices have it lol,277
if corporations can get votinglobbying rights and seen as persons they need to get taxed as such yes 25 is fair from billionaires and corporations since working class people get 23 taken from their pay,272
its sickening watching republicans not standing in ovation at bidens remarks against putin and russia sickening,263
i wonder if those in that room truly fathom how despised they are by the american people,236
mtg is pure unadulterated trash,231
when he was talking about fighting big pharma you could tell whos pockets were lined in the audience big pharmas dark money runs deep,227
im a right leaning american and that is the joe biden ive needed to hear for as long as i can remember,225
medicare being able to negotiate drug prices and capping insulin at 35 is a huge relief for everyone in america insurance rates and non insured healthcare is so expensive because greedy pharmaceutical corporations are charging insane amounts because they know they can get away with it how is it that something that costs 10 to make would be sold 400 its about time a sitting president said no and told big pharma to drop their prices and cap it as someone with elderly parents i am thankful,216
i love how biden plays the reps ohh you dont like that bill which is theirs lol,214
mike johnson has become the embodiment of in my heart of hearts i know i am on the wrong side of history but must double down on my hypocrisy to save face,214
you cant love your country only when you win,213
hope beats hate,209
im so proud to be an american the presidents speech was awesome if you notice mike johnson was agreeing and also clapping you know donald trumps going to get mad at him for doing that but remember president biden says hes for all americans not just one side god bless america vote,199
a president that doesnt whine and cry about how unfair hes been treated breath of fresh air,198
doesnt seem very sleepy to me and he speaks in full sentences unlike someone else we all know,197
watching katie britt deliver the gop response makes me believe she failed drama class,190
uncle joe still knows how to work a room he wasnt my first choice in 2020 but hes getting my vote in november,190
greene looks like she should be outside pushing a souvenir cart,189
viva biden absolutely welcoming to hear biden say what he did i couldnt take my eyes off of house speaker johnson as he twisted and turned like a nightcrawler well republicans you asked for it and you got it from a wonderful president muchas gracias biden so proud of you for a wonderful speech,187
i willstop you the dark brandon one liners are always hilarious,186
youd find less crooks in a prison food hall,183
i didnt see any dementia from joe he used complete sentences wasnt slurring and actually made sense hes old but much more sane and coherent than trump,178
youd think that johnson and company could see to it that they at least clap for cutting child poverty taking care of our elders and covering everyone with health insurance but no allegiance to party and not country ssdd,177
i loved when he looked at the supreme court and told them to watch out for the womenold men just sat there,172
president bidenyou did an outstanding jobspeech was real authentic and trump could never speak as long as you did with focuswith factswith integrity with empathywith intentionhe could never,166
what a great president lets stand up for democracy and freedom and vote,165
over an hour energized coherent morally clear you wont get that from trump heck you wont get that from any republican anymore and yet people pretend that he can barely speak anymore because our generation lives entirely off of a few 10 second clips,164
awesome a president who has a platform other than a wannabe dictator intent on retribution,161
no more tax cuts for the wealthy and big companies,158
congratulations to president biden on his excellent speech vote for democracy vote blue,158
i am convinced mtg is illiterate,156
proud of this president,156
powerful and sincere bravo mr president,156
johnson was really uncomfortable when confronted with remembrance of his actions is history,148
biden knocked it out of the park 4 more years vote blue down the line vote all republicans out especially maga,143
mike johnson looks like hes going to combust from embarrassment,140
amazing he delivered trump can only ramble,140
a very important speech delivered very well,140
that folks is what a president is supposed to sound like hope not the other guy whose always down on everything and everyone and is always trying to frighten these poor people that look up to him for leadership,131
yes a man of the people compassion experience loved by the majority and when it counts he is there and delivers yep and can hit back,126
so proud of president biden he gave a dynamic and inspiring speech,125
four more years bidenharris 2024,123
a great speech from a great president 4 more years,123
not clapping or respecting our president because of your allegiance to your party is wrong and unamerican,120
amazing speech made me feel hopeful and looking forward to november lets get to work,120
great state of union,120
loved the chastised looks on sc faces,119
he did his thing biden 2024,119
if you are wondering if republicans are for americansnone of them stood or clapped for reducing drug prices,117
i watched some of this i was disgusted but not surprised by the decorum of some notable maga republicans yelling shouting showing absolute disrespect mtg has got to go,117
johnsons probably going to be in the dog house for all of his unconscious head nodding,115
we need meaningful campaign reforms 1 eliminate campaign donations and solicitations including super pacs 2 open primaries to independent voters nationwide 3 no more gerrymandering political maps 4 eliminate the electoral college that provides 538 chosen people the ability to determine the president,115
agree with a lot especially the education you have to invest in your populace if you hope them to be able to defend your nation,113
thank god for mtg shes single handedly will cost republicans elections as long as shes on a camera somewhere,113
2024 state of the union adress by president joe biden was excellent,113
thats the good president talking the true,113
johnson smirking when joe says stop it referring to stopping gun violence sys it all,110
yes we the people need to enable biden to continue on his path to improve our nation as a democracy,110
80 of these old men are supposed to be in jail quite shocked to see them out and about,106
anybody else think mike johnson looks like hed rather be anyplace else than behind the president,104
great speech mr president you keep pushing back those republican you got my vote vote blue,104
gotta love that alabama gov ivey literally scrambled to sign a bill to protect ivf in her state not coincidentally just 1 day before tonights sotu address and the subsequent rebuttal by sen britt of alabama the entire gop is in full blown scramble mode right now the look on the faces of the conservative supreme court justices during pres bidens speech regarding r v w and ivf were priceless i hope that they were as uncomfortable as their expressionless faces demonstrated they were,103
great speach mtg needs ti be removed,103
our president gave a great speech with detail regarding what he has done and what he intends to do which is a lot god bless america and god protect our troops,103
he went right at the supreme court justices,102
the maga supreme court was left with egg rotten on there faces lmbao patrick,102
suprised the comments are open for us,101
great delivery of a greater speech that is my president and will be for 4 more years,101
god bless america and god bless and protect joe biden im so proud to be an american once again thank you president biden for talking about all you have accomplished as president the list is long and impressive you have the energy and the heart of a much younger man here is to helping you meet all the life saving goals you have set dont ever let the trumps or abbotts get in your way they are paid by millionaires for their votes and favors much like a common prostitute their interests are self serving only enough of them and no more,100
5220 remember when trump said hed have the best healthcare plan to replace the disaster of obamacare and never did,96
i went back to watch trumps sotu address and see democrats give trump the stand ovation i dont see johnson or almost any republicans give us president the same respect as democratic gave to trump what ashamed these people who called themselves professional,96
mike johnsons eyes were rolling more than the wheels on a confederate paddleboat,95
seriously mike johnson you are the speaker of the house and you dont stand for the president of united states regardless of partythat is extremely disrespectful sir,94
great job mr president,94
our president joe biden gave the american people an outstanding speech of hope unity kindness democracy compassion love for one another the constitution over party how the country is thriving with all the work his administration is doing in partnership with the democratic party holding its ground working for every day americans that will continue for another four years he has my vote,93
he killed it im impressed,93
great speech president joe biden,93
proud to be american again,91
ninth inning bases loaded biden up the score is tied 32 count and biden knocks it out of the park grand slammer for the democratic team way to go joe,90
he did a wonderful job tonight so proud,88
no respect for the supreme court bought and paid for,87
mgt is dressed so unprofessionally literally looks like a 10 year old dressed in their favorite singers or bands merch what a joke,86
i have to admit that this tired old fart actually mananged to regain my vote this evening well done joe whether i like it or not are a true sliver of what is left of what our country has been and could eventually be this was the adept and cognizant president i had only dreamed to hear from today so sad that echo chambers will keep this from being heard anywhere else that this side of field,86
the gop response is so dark and out of touch what dummies,86
mike johnson cant clap for lower rent healthcare or universal pre k all you need to know,85
go joethank you sir,85
wow he knocked it out of the ballpark you go mr president,84
loved how he went after the supreme court right in front of their faces,83
awesome speech ridin with biden,83
the president for sure checked and balanced the supreme court tonight he did great,83
johnson was bitting his bottom lip thur the entire union,83
mtg looks like a hostess hello welcome to dennys,82
i work a full time job and the price of groceries is killing me totally unable to put anything in the bank what about that,82
the lack of applause in half of the room makes clear that we are at war with the enemy in our own country chilling,82
after this speech i have never been more certain that president biden is the right person for this job at this unique and precarious time in history hes the wise elderwarrior to help ensure the survival of democracy for the millenia to come,82
stunningly brilliant speech and didnt you just love the really stupid mtg in her maga hat heckle and fall right into his trap loved it,82
best state of the union speech ever and i am almost 70 years old yay joe biden,82
anyone else thinks he knocked it out of the park,80
is there anyone in this room under the age of 50,77
that was a great sotu almost makes me like him as a candidate instead of being a nottrump vote he shut down any suggestion hes senile tonight,77
where is clarence thomas on a freebie trip,77
fantastic speach,77
its a shame that the speaker of the house isnt standing snd clapping this partisan politics is tearing this great nation apart hes third in line although he is a trump puppet,76
we have to get to the polls and vote we have to make sure bidens vision for america is the one we get dont take anything for granted get out and vote and take friends with you its your job as an american to defend freedom and democracy,76
the word is the old politition with political skills he got into politics when he was too young 29 now age has its glory awesome speech,76

i love our president biden,75
great speech great job great outlook for the future mr president,74
msm now keep telling us how biden is senile saw none of that here,73
job well done president joe biden a president with a plan even foxnews was impressed bidenharris 2024,73
love my president,73
4357 loved his dig on the repubs that didnt support the infrastructure bill,71
my goodness if this is a man with cognitive decline i cant see any evidence ive watched every sotu since i turned 18 from gw bush through this one bidens are among the best i hope i have this kind of energy 40 years from now when im joes age,70
love you president biden best president in us history,70
wow while i am not a us citizen biden was amazing he sounded strong did not ramble or go off course he is a president,68
gotta respect maga mike nodding in agreement during the ukraine portion even when biden criticized trump he nodded gentler nod during that part but still a nod he wont last long the cult is going to eat him,67
mtg is wearing her iq on her hat,67
99 of republicans talking points evaporated tonight the old guy is very capable,67
welcome to the sage age folks cant wait until bluevember,67
epipens bro epipens add that to the list if it isnt there already,66
speaker johnson looks extremely uncomfortable with the facts,66
how is reducing the price of insulin a bad thing these republicans are mean,66
im not surprised at all at how well he delivered this speech i saw him speak years ago very passionate about our country and its ppl and as far as being old only someone with his experience could speak with such conviction we could never say that about trump,65
he gets my vote every time,65
i wouldve had mtg tossed out since she doesnt know how to act shes so slow its ridiculous and shes not true representation of my state georgia,64
this wasnt a state of the union address it was a campaign ad,63
hes accomplished a record of accomplishments regardless of a completely ineffective house give biden a democratic house senate then see what can be accomplished,63
im with joe right now democracy is in danger people whats wrong with saving democracy i think so please do anything possible to help i am i wil till my dying day love yah,63
youre not giving another 2 trillion dollar tax break to your donors thats good to hear,62
that was really satisfying to watch im so glad he came out swinging there was none of this my friends across the aisle crap it was a throw down great job,62
johnson looked like a kid whose mom forced him to sit for a time out,62
mr president youre still looking awesome bless him jesus,62
no respect for scotus they dont deserve it,62
i am so moved and proud all of these hard working and devoted patriots,62
you do realize that all of those people sitting in there agree with what joe biden is saying they just dont want anyone to know it they want the benefit of everything joe biden wants to give us all but they want to take it away from you stop the republicans before you lose everything,61
i did not expect the president to kick every conservative talking point in the balls wow,61
my god please lets get the teachers a pay raise they need is desperately,61
biden did a great job despite idiotic reps yelling at him and silly response from alabama rep,61
great speech biden ive never heard trump be as motivating as joe,61
we love you president biden,61
thank you mr president for showing all haters that you are truly in an amazing mental fitness and can take the country into a greater success in the coming 5 years to all haters of all ages keep quite lets keep decency in this great nation joe biden is a true american who loves all americans and the usa vote for joe president biden everyone,60
that was an incredible speech im actually optimistic,60
the general reaction of the republicans not clapping not standing yelling insults and grimacing at certain points is a horrible example for all americans their disrespect is what has enabled division n this country they are modeling childish behavior and a lack of honor i sincerely hope we can turn away from that and be reunited respectful of all our fellow citizens and use our energy to make our lives better instead of trying to make our neighbors lives unbearable,59
so glad i dont have to see the accordiion hands ever again at a sotu speech,59
maybe the most important speech in history no pressure go joe,59
biden for democracy,59
people shouting out way too much i wish people were more decent,58
johnson looked like he was afraid to agree with the president and was trying to clap unseen but was seen he just couldnt hold back,58
this true christian man wants to serve his country his people hes not a celebrity seeking his own power hes a worker and a doer rapidly healing his country,57
what an amazing state of the union go joe,57
what a speech he just keeps punching mike johnson in the face,57
omgthank you president biden for actually governing for all the peopleexcellent sotu btw,57
the traitors of the church bench have left the building back to their bunker,57
mike johnson looks ridiculous shaking his head at facts,56
mr president biden that was exceptional outstanding leadership magnificent speech,56
mike johnson nodded in agreement with everything the president said until 3211 thats when he started talking about the coup attempt on jan6 at that point johnsons demeanor changed he was a part of the coup,55
does anyone honestly believe trump in his present state could do that,55
so proud of all hes accomplished,55
notice how people smile and laugh when biden addresses themyouve never seen that under trump only anger hate and fear thats not us thats us as in us,54
just a tip watch this at 15x speed,53
well done mr president,53
biden was on tonight i love my president,53
corporate america wants an educated workforce and skill trades people but they dont want more taxes to help get that done i get it millionaires and billionaires taxes stink but kudos to you guys and gals you know how to take risks help us help you lets increase taxes on you and we can give you updated infrastructure educated skilled and healthy workers we can continue to set your and your grandchildren up,52
tutor the scotus justices first teach them english so that they understand the constitution,52
i doubt trump couldve gotten finland sweden in nato,52
watching from francegreat speechgood luck usa,51
i am so proud to be an american mr president i salute magnanimous outstanding speech i am moved,51
1 public school teachers need more money 2 child tax credit are needed 3 big corporations need to pay higher taxes pay your share 4 stupid junk fees 5 bank card late fees from 358 bucks 6 border control needs to be fixed 7 pass the voting rights 8 pass the equality act 9 pass the pro rights 10 climate act clean energy jobs 11 all americans need to be safe 12 invest cities with mental health workers more police reforms crimes of domestic violence one of the best sotu talks ive heard he is offering us so much more than what trump would give,50
mtg annoying as usual for once let your brain do the thinking other than that useless cap,50
trump im voting for biden after that speech thank you,50
that republican response was so annoying to listen to i thought she was going to burst into tears throughout her speech,50
thank you mr president for a great speech that boldens american,50
thank you president biden fot painting such a positive future for america america is not a third world country like the former president keeps stating onward and upward president biden made in america it is looooooking soooo good,49
at 4356 if any of you dont want that money in your district just let me know dark brandon,49
could mike johnson have acted more childish,49
wonderful speech,49
you can see that mike johnson wants to clap more but knows he cant because hell get voted out as speaker,48
ok not that it matters but did anyone else notice that he didnt let the speaker introduce him normally the speaker says like i have the high honor and distinct pleasure of presenting to you the president of the united states but president biden just went into his speech before johnson could get the words out,48
wow someone should do an ad with what biden would do for the people and what trump will do for trump,46
great speech,46
what a stark difference the calm assured voice of biden as opposed to the finger nails on a chalk board voice of trump,46
that ending i see a future i see a future so very kennedyesque,46
you cant even begin to compare the orange candidate to biden he speaks sense hes humorous he has great plans to move the country forward hes the reason we admire america,45
bidin is fired up this time should be fun to watch the debates in the future,45
despite allegations that i might be old etc the claims being made against biden even in my weakest moments would never encourage me to vote for trump age has not rendered me stupid what policies were favored by dems applause what policies were not favored by repubs no positive response whatsoever check your info sources people johnjane schmotz and hisher ilk are not sources of truthful information if you dont comprehend this comment you have identified your critical thinking shortcomings,45
this president bidens sotu address 2024 will be studied as long as we are a democracy,44
a great start to his speech could have been seal team 6 enters biden says draw your weapons they point them at everyone then he says stand down this is what presidential immunity looks like but we do not have presidential immunity in our democracy addressing the supreme court say im embarrassed that you could even be considering this is this what you want me to be able to do would have been the most powerful way to demonstrate the absurdity of trumps case,44
i was disgusted to see some of the not supreme court there happy not to see crooked clarence alito maybe too ashamed to show their faces,44
we prayed today for joe that his truth would shineaft brillant jobso proud i put my old biden harris election memorabilia with every saint surrounding them beautiful job thanks to you my aunt was a victim of a home abortionboth my grandma and granny were devout christians but believed 100 in womens choiceive always believed thisour bodies our selves again beautiful job mr president never sounding better to meyes wisdom comes with age,44
wow biden speech was really great i literally had to watch it to its end im very glad i didi literally donated to him he nailed it right out the ball park,44
seeing him in this manner makes me proud to be american go joe you are amazing your son is also shown such remarkable coourage style and grace while certain members of our congress try to destroy him the biden family are an tough as nails and who need need leading us,43
reps couldnt even stand for a call for non violence in political discoursewow,43
i have so much disgust and contempt for scotus term limits on them,43
job well done mr president,43
take that smirk smile of your face speaker johnson you should be ashamed of your behaviour,42
johnson is such a worm,42
very impressive joe did a phenomenal job,42
my favorite part happened before the sotu when biden completely dissed marge green,41
he appears to be perfectly coherent and alert to me,41
im am 60yrs old and never watched the state of the unions addresses ever because our democracy wasnt on the line until today because our democracy is on the line due to donald trump and his maga followers and the republicans who represent his lies i never voted a day in my life but today i will,41
i can just imagine every republican in the house just hoping and praying with hopes and prayers that joe screws up badly sorry suckers hopes and prayers are never enough,39
so much corruption in one room i could smell it,39
keep warming that seat mr speaker we the people are watching too not just history,39
this is the leadership we need betterment not destruction vote blue love ya president biden,39
so reassuring listening to president joe biden speakhe brings back hope for the countryvote blue,39
biden 2024,39
mike johnson is rolling his eyes smirking and shaking his head consistently like a teenager johnson is so over his head as speaker and his inexperience is on full display as he sits in back of the president mike you keep demonstrating how immature you are as a member of congress,38
we really see what the majority of republican party is for and against by their reactions to certain issues 4 more years,38
room looks like a retirement home,38
mtg is like the villain on a reality show she says whatever she needs to get air time,38
watching the president leaves us with a sense of competent dignified service watching his predecessor is like watching a dumpster fire smelled around the world,37
a 25 tax minimum for billionaires better than gop oligarch putinpolicy but still too low in the 50s it was 90,37
well thats the most worthwhile hour ive spent in quite a while i too had begun to wonder whether the old guy still had it in him i really think he does god bless america we all need you to make the right choices as never before,36
unemployment is so low because everyone has to work just to survive these inflated debts,36
mike johnson looks like an absolute clown sitting back there,36
maannn if only the current prime minister of england and his party would take note and follow suit on how president joe biden leads his party and how hes doing his utmost best for people united states of america president joe biden sir,36
4 more years this was the best state of the union address ive heard in a very very long time president joe biden has good job mr president,36
as part native american ive been taught that the united states is indigenous land more than british land,36
such a great speech by a great president bidenharris 2024,36
trickle down doesnt work,35
what about insider trading for politicians,34
well if thats old senile im up for it brilliant speech mr presidentwith love from ireland,34

anyone ever think about how this period in american history is going to be written if i was a maga cultist id be concerned my grandchildren are going to find out i chose one man over an entire country the shame you will feel will be immense im all for it,33
was never much of a biden fan prior to his presidency but have so come to admire this guy what a champ an amazing speech mr president youre doing great and thank you for setting that wonderful positive example to democracies and elderly citizens everywhere a bright shining and stark alternative to the messages of fear division and hate from the repugnant insecure loser who wants to be king the cesspool across the aisle that cower before him and the ugly damaged souls aligned with them,33
epic speech four more years,33
love how kamille harris ignores johnson,32
trump will have seen lankford say its true when biden was talking about what was in the border bill i hope he has security,32
one of the best talks i have ever heard by a president and i believe every word he is saying hes not at all like trump,32
joe kicked that door down and did a full mic drop,32
not a person in that room pumped their gas or bought there oun groceries,31
great job president biden long live us decency maturity fairness honesty international cooperation and democracy,31
the best part was watching johnson sit behind joe not able to do anything because he knew his boss was watching him not even smile would of been a very uncomfortable 1hr 41min 25sec thats what you get when swear elegance to a wannabe dictator,31
i watched the entire speech twice and it was just amazing,31
hes not joking around folks he really means it,30
4 more years thankyou joe,30
mike johnsons face might end up stuck in that position if he keeps it that way much longer,30
bravo president biden you are amazing,30

they drugged him up good for this one,28
im watching mike johnson trying to look professional but i see that he knows what biden has done and accomplished johnson and the rest of them are being shamed and its great bless joe biden for saving america,28
now that is the true potus not the depraved orange predecessor who cant make even a basic sentence that would make any sense,28
did johnson have super glue on his seat,28
mike didnt know wether to crap or get off the pot you could see him holding back on agreement to many points,28
he is a fantastic president he is all about moving forward,28
great speech by a great leader from europe with love lets save democracy and our civilization counting on you us,27

comes the hour comes the man as an aussie in melbourne i can breathe a little easier i have been watching us politics for years and i am so happy that sane america has a voice to proud of trump that trump,26
speaking of shrinkflation i just discovered that the laundry detergent bottle is also not that fullthis is ridiculous,26
iq45 for prison 24,26
twice in my life have i stood listening to speeches president obama and tonight president biden this is america looking forward what is behind us is the past,26
nailed it,26
i havent heard a speech that has made me feel this proud to be an american with undiluted hope for the future since ronald reagans speeches thank you president biden,26
man these republicans just look really sad,25
mike johnson shakes his head in disagreement about the low inflation rates at 4110,25
funny i like biden a lot more now than i did when he was in his prime,25
look at all these rich politicians that are doing their best to see that all americans are getting their moneys worth with their tax dollars our tax dollars pay their salaries if youre a taxpayer not getting what you deserve these are the folks responsible for it,25
if this would had been trump the only thing that he would have said is mi my self and i,25
its so nice to listen to a president that 1 knows what hes talking about 2 sincerely means everything he says and 3 you will never here him whine and cry i am proud to be a democrat i would vote for president biden any day of the week to end this i agree with everyone that the disrespect from the republicans is ridiculous you dont have to agree with the president by you should respect the office thank you president biden for a great speech,25
the president delivered a strong to the point kept it real speech tonight he put those who question his leadership cause of age in shame tonight bravo mr president i will be proud as a reagan republican to vote for president biden once again,25
wonderful funny to see supreme court show there faces after what they did to us woman,25
should be able to eject mtg a movie theater would toss her out for her behavior,24
dear god what happened to you america absolutely devestated to see what this country has become,24
you are looking at a republican party that doesnt want an democracy anymore they want power and they want to remain in power,24
i love president biden what a class act usa usa usa,24
honestly a great address a few hickups but there was great energy and the things that was said were spot on,24
imagine a future without trump it isnt hard to do,24
so much for his age probably the best speech by joe truth eloquence and facts not lies and rants,24
so glad he nailed it tough for anyone to think these ideas arent good,24
yall he just has a stutter you can tell when he is focused and passionate it goes away it is not dementia nimwits,24
what is george santos still doing there thought he was removed from congress,24
these people dont even care whats happening to you or your country has they all get rich and america gets poorer,24
epic speech tonight from president biden,24
well done biden,24
smug little howdy doody puppet shaking his head in the background,24
thats my president he nailed it bidenharris 2024,24
has everyone forgot whats happening in texas,23
such a powerful speech joe really energized me to vote for him with this one,23
one could almost feel sympthay for johnson he is likely being watched closely by trump and cannot applaud,23
great speech now we need to repeat all these great accomplishments mentioned here to remind people whats at stake,23
watch the republican response people it is absolutely laughable,23
not bad for an old bloke i hope im that sharp at his age well done joe,23
lets goooo dark brandon,23
lawmakers should not be allowed to accept donors money while they are in office its will divide the party lets pass a law to stop this type of work ethics,22
this is what leadership looks like no whining and complaining straight forward encouraging unafraid,22
good summary of the state of our union positive accounting of achievements a cleareyed view of challenges that we face,22
biden is old but hes good,22
mike johnson looks like he eants to crawl under the table sitting behind a truly strong leader sitting next ro another one must be excruciatingly intimidating to him,22
the people in that room constitute the bulk of his 37 approval ratings,22
johnson looks very upset hes making faces moving his head from right to left and left to right will it come unscrewed will it role of,22
one decent man vs an indecent one,22
uncle joe was on fire love it,22
this wasnt a state of the union address this was a campaign speech,21
that was a sermon tonight and watching the glad handing after the address was informative as to his cognitive resilience and stamina,21
im 18 and im glad to vote for biden as my firsttime candidate im proud of his legislation and the work he has done to protect democracy and move our nation forward,21
johnson doesnt have the courtesy to stand for biden,21
love that line u cant love your country only when you win our president was on fire last night he reaffirmed my vote vote blue america,21
i had no time for mike johnson before tonight i am and will always be a bernie supporter do the maths ok social democrat left of centre but i have been paying particular attention to johnson during bidens speech and i see a more decent person than i thought him to be or perhaps what he wants us to think he is i am watching when he claps or when he smiles or nods in agreement if trump or any of his advisors are watching this i would put money on johnson being gone by the end of the month or sooner,21
i wish we had a leader like this in the uk,21
i want this joe more often where is this guy every day,21
trump maga and gop members of the house should be hearing footsteps between the presidents words it is the sound of millions of voters walking to the voting booths and voting for biden and the democrats,21
biden 2024,21
that was amazing,21
watching republican response right now utterly cringeworthy and lacking in facts total drama what garbage,21
3000 pretty powerful speech joe gg,21
love joe biden,21
biden rocks,20
finally someone speaks for working americans,20
these fools havent figured out that joe doesnt flub when retorting hecklers thank you joe democracy is worth the fight,20
the star wars bar scene at the beginning is amazing,20
i love sheldon whitehouse,20
god bless our experienced respectful excellent presidentreminded me of the roosevelt speech during the depressiongave us hope optimism,20
i thought he was great got his speech was both for the union and a kickoff his run for presidency agin he gave me hope and thats what i want as a potencial not someone that dose not make me feel hope i even loved the sparing and giving it right back at them and a very nice sendoff tio the campane trail for biden,20
biden nailed it,20
ive been a biden guy since the eighties gratifying go joe go jill go kamala,20
4 more years president biden you are a descent human being who loves his country,20
four more years,20
the smugness and condecending demeanor of maga mike johnson mr bible is disgusting he is the most hypocritical person in politics today and there is a lot of competition for that title,19
there are far too many commercial interruptions during bidens speech itself msnbc or youtube stop this and broadcast at least the speech itself as every other media outlet does without commercial interruption,19
he nailed this to the wall he just did,19
president biden you knocked the ball out of the park with your speech well done,19
actions speak louder than words november cant get here fast enough,19
27 41 now it is we who are facing an unprecedented moment in our history this is no ordinary moment president joe biden,19
the camera man rocks check out the highback chairs on the flag stripessymmetry baby,19
as a ukrainian i am grateful to you mister president and to the usa which is always close to ukraine the support of the usa is invaluable we will defeat mordor if us support increases we will never bow down to a putler either,19
thank you for this video i have every capacity and commitment to challenge correct and confront our political and governing people in authority and leadership the republicans have been outrageously out of control and irresponsible for many years and the democrats and liberals have significant issues to face and fix themselves however this point in our countrys health and basic function reclaiming our core sanity and sobriety is paramount president biden was on fire i also noticed how beloved he is by so many people,19
very very uplifting genuine question would someone explain to a brit why anyone would oppose anything jb said,19
imagine the fundraising now joe is the american president democracy does work,19
absolutely what we needed to hear especially the ppl who dont understand what joe has done still not a fan of his socalled policy in the me as its not even remotely accurate,19
haha the supreme court sitting their stoic was to die for i thought the one time mike johnson clapped for ukraine was going to sear his hands,19
did he or did he not discipline the so called supreme court,19
trump lost his court case here in the uk today we wont put up with this fool,19
great job joe,19
brilliant as a british viewer i wish we could have president biden replace our feeble lot over here,18
that was an actual president of the united states someone who is actually doing the job 13430,18
viva pres biden ciao from rome,18
absolutely superb mr president,18
great coverage msnbc,18
i love my president joe biden and i support him 100 for 4 more years go joe,18
great speech go joe,18
i love the president,18
take notethe speaker of the house often looked ashamed of him self,17
one president speaks of optimism hope equality and plans and policy ideas for the future the opponent whines about 91 counts for his own criminal activities and wants us to know hed pick electrocution over being eaten by a shark which to choose,17
hear that johnson you cant love your country only when you win,17
can wait for the debate this is a campaign speech,17
republican senators need compulsive training in decorum and respect chewing gum using cell phones and shouting should not be allowed no matter who the president is how low can you get,17
this rhetoric that hes old senile and confused is just plain stupid i see a leader when i watch this speech a true passionate leader,17
there was no shouting like i saw in comments on x in terms of speech delivery this was good,17
great speech,17
joe just caught lightning his predecessor must be consigned to the dustbin of history like a very bad dream this is a powerful wake up call you cant love your country only when you win,17
we need four more years to set this mess of trump straight and then get the younger leaders that understand democracy to lead us into the future god bless america,17
mike johnson scornful sitting in the back like a bobble head,17
wow,17
i knew hed nail it im impressed and amazed,17
joe biden was a kid who overcame a lifelong stutter to become an activist a legislator a negotiator a senator a speaker and president of the united states in the most powerful job in the world joe still occasionally stumbles over a word what a hero lets support that guy,16
been longtime coming wow wow truth be hold,16
all are corrupt guy put a bill to help border and the ones that are the most complainers decline it how is that something is something,16
you keep saying you will make the rich pay more taxes and im all for that but you say it and do nothing just remove the taxable income cap from ss and medicare taxes a good start good for the ss budget and not a huge burden on the rich it might seem like it from the amount it would collect but we regular people pay it on 100 of our income so should they,16
this very experienced politician knows what a country needs to be content and healthy,16
i like how we have crime increasing across this country but theyre out here clapping like theres no fires to put out the country is blazin,16
wonderful president the contrast with trump is so stark and admirable how anyone can support trump is beyond any logic or ethical reasoning,16
that was a speech that he hit out of the ball park,16
good to hear a us president talking about policies,16
go biden show them how is it done,16
what a great speech by a great president no complaints and its not rigged,16
the gop response person shows a very painful look on her face,16
what a wonderful president we have four more years,16
great speech glad to see this fire the usa has been letting republicans kick sand in our face for too long,15
president biden and his administration will go down in history as one of the greatest give them a chance to continue the good job vote for the sake of the us and the world vote blue vote peace,15
god bless you sir wake up americans wake up american women rise and vote for the freedom to choose your own path in life rather than being told what you cant do to conduct your own personal life and your health thank you sir,15
loved it how he completly ignored mtg,15
all those geezers got their squats in for how many times they stood up,15
thank god were cutting late fees on credit cards,15
great state of the union,15
how can you not love this guy glory to the free world,15
bravo president biden amazing man amazing leader,15
biden stopping to talk to nearly everyone shows he is a people person and that says a lot about his character i respect that,15
missing a few justices are we bowling night,15
what a great speech listened to a few minutes of the rebuttal sister mentioned how any woman in the country could let the men in their lives write pass and vote for policies that are so extremely prejudicial to women and the lyrics of southern man started in my head so i told echo to play it didnt help my mood on a high after joe but she condescended me right out of it into anger about what passes for a decent human in some parts of this country some christian parts of the country where bible verses adorn the public school walls yet rainbows are banned,15
imagine voting for people who were born during a time when everything was made of wood,15
,15
i have probably watched 15 sotu speeches in my 72 years and this was the most impressive performance by a potus in my lifetime,14
a room full of showered clean well fed people,14
lol luv how mike tries to keep a straight face during some of scotus comments,14
how anyone can look at this man as a failure is just ridiculous he will be up there with one of the best us presidents of all time,14
imagine having a child murdered by someone in the country illegally and your supreme leader says to your face on national television well its not thousands being murdered sooo then go on to complain about mistreatment of illegal immigrants following up with a heartfelt promise to save a couple of prisoners from hamas not a word about all the loss of life in ukraine tho disgusting i feel bad for those parents that was really mean,14
what did the guy yell from upstairs i heard something marine,14
these are the rich men north of richmond,14
i must say i enjoyed the various shade of crimson on moses mikes face as the president called the gop out for their despicable behavior,14
praise the lord god bless american and let democracy live forever god bless the president biden and all americans who believe in freedom and justice for all,14
shut up mtg,14
i kinda feel sorry for mike johnson i think he may be wishing joe was his president,14
sorry but if donald trum had done that speech it would have been much sleepier sorry correction donald trump simply couldnt have done that speech,14
nice job mr biden very nice job godspeed from the netherlands,14
this was so good i have to watch it again thats a first who ever wanted to watch a sotu address twice joe knocked it out of the park,14
biden hit it out of the park i dont know how it could have been more perfect 4 more years,14
go joe,14
go president biden,14
biden actually did well tonight,14
why was george santos there,13
lets save democracy and reelect this president and give him a congress that works for the people the choice couldnt be clearer,13
great state of union speech gop needs to open their ears and listen,13
youtube ads on the state of the unionnice,13
the funny part when all the rich people awkwardly wooing when he said tax the rich more hahahahaha everyone that was in the room was like what you saying joe,13
sir why are you yelling at us,13
why was santos there,13
we need a time stamp of when it starts,13
good job i take that back great job,13
mtg getting absolutely ignored while she stands there with her dumb little button is amazing she is the worst servant we have ever had,13
the look pamala harris gave mike johnson when he was slow to stand up and applaud the great john lewis was priceless great speech from the president the race for the wh begins,13
just wish hed point out that unless you are 100 american native indian you and we are immigrants even though im an aussie and feel native my blood line isnt and thats my point we are mostly all are migrants now matter where we live just really stoked i get to live in a democracy,13
now our work is to make 4 more years happen lets massively vote blue,13
thats our president god bless him and god bless america,13
love you grandpa joe a realistic experienced good ole timer kick as leader thanks grandpa your working more than the republicans ever will,13
he was very strong its so simple in a way we vote for a man that is so mentally disturbed and negative preying on our fears and ignorance that some people have and refuse to see it for what it is disturbing and sad,13
awesome,13
our president may have somewhat of a speech impediment but at least he talks sensibly id rather have somebody up there thats logical and of sound mind and body so what if he makes a couple of slipups,12
yay teachers need a raise,12
i wonder how many americans will make sure that they hear this speech from this mature wise and very active president i beg every us citizen that believes in this mans ability to edit and share share share to educate all those who are ignorant of what this awesome man is doing for his country,12
how many people have been killed by the weapons you left in afghanistan,12
so standing ovation mean nothing if everyone just stands up every time he finishes a sentence,12
european woman here wouw wouw wouw yes we can what a speech that is the america we love,12
just think nancy pelosi ruth bader ginsburg bernie sanders theyre elderly like joe and sharp as whips im not concerned about age if they were all like elderly trump rambling and lost you bet id worry,12
oh my goodness as a nonamerican i never been sooo proud of an american president president biden cares for all his fellow americans his speech bought tears to my eyes many times for hope for all americans 4 more years because americas democracy and freedom is so important for all the world vote blue americans across the states,12
unions used to be strong and america grew workers had protections,12
speaker doesnt look happy,12
well done magnificently addressed the main concerns of american citizens democracy peace the economy and of course the safeguarding of all humans basic human rights a campaign safely covered and landed on the ears of all americans yes all cause republican supporters couldnt and never stop to listen to what their leaders past and current could never ever deliver,12
will someone please buy mtg a muzzle,12
thank you mr president for your amazing state of the union you addressed everything this country needs to discusse i could never be more proud of a president then i was of you tonight you give us all hope again to keep democracy safe under your watch vote blue not insane orange,12
enough with the ageism,12
what a clown he really sat there and lied for over an hour fjb and this administration blacks for trump 2024,12
does mtg really not know thats clown wear,11
hey msnbc why did you allow there to be so many ads into this video of president bidens great speech the ads are very disruptive,11
i see a room full of delusional sociopathic and narcissistic liars and thieves the true enemies of the american people threatening the supreme court was cool,11
what is happening at 11706 i hear screaming but cant make it out,11
4 more years,11
i like a future where the church doesnt have the right to strip others of their freedoms,11
all i care about is the price of groceries gas and rent going down also people in apartments dont want electric vehicles stop pushing them on us we can barely afford the vehicles that we already have,11
more of a campaign speech rather than a state of the union i guess it cant be helped in an election year,11
proud of my president,11
at least we got to hear everything biden needed to say during the debates im sure when its biden turn to speak trump will be butting in every chance he gets just to talk about meaningless crap,11
10710 this is a good one full cost price tags would make saving so much easier,11
so many congressmen and women respect and love president biden he inspires them to continue working hard to fight against our countrys biggest threat which is not external but internal prayers that the state of the union speech will crack hardened hearts and open closed minds,11
this is an example why age is a number biden spoke very well,11
strong and powerful speech,11
great speech to the american people president biden we love you,11
12 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package 19 trillion covid relief deal unemployment 4 for 2 years inflation reduction actchips and science act bipartisan safer communities act more to go,11
i wonder if johnson is squirming because hes about to lose his job,11
america is lucky to have biden,11
proud of our president joe biden keep up the good work,11
great presidential couple biden jill unlike melanie trump jill biden actually does contribute to biden presidential agenda,11
american superstar vote blue,11
without getting political i will say one thing biden proved to be much more with it than most people have been giving him credit for and probably spooked many republicans who only watch gaff reels,10
i would like to know what the republicans are standing for nada,10
best state of the union address ever superb,10
one of the best state of the union addresses ive ever heard,10
to see when he said no child should go hungry the repubs sit there and did not clapsad,10
this was president bidens best speech to date he laid out his plan for union and didnt hold back punches president biden keep up the good work you are doing we support you,10
housing our children can afford healthcare we all can afford do republicans have a way to deliver those things,10
say and believe what you will but president biden slayed em at the state of the union address with the facts not lies facts so i will say to all my fellow americans the choice is yours the america we want or the america they want i think we only have one real choice vote blue,10
that my friends is a president thank you president biden,10
joe biden has a razorsharp mind a smart vocabulary and a great plan for america,10

this is what a great leader a true american president looks like thank you president bidenhe is a decent honorable educated experienced caring man someone that projects love and unity not hate and diversity like the one that goes from rally to rally talking just about himself and promoting social violence and hate among anyone that doesnt agree with his cult,10
biden has a vision that he can articulate i proud of you joe my president riding with biden,10

thats my president i didnt vote for him in 2020 but he has my vote now thats the leadership we need to defend democracy at home and abroad sir i doubt you read this but you just convinced a lifelong republican to switch sides,9
as a brit i wish we had a leader who could speak with such authority it was wonderful to watch the speaker squirm in his chair and watch a true leader speak clearly and forcefully without slurring without mixing up names or countries and even pointing at the woman that was his wife,9
george santos really gop,9
go joe hes my president he did not even call anyone a childish name,9
because of this state of the union address and how well it was done ill be proudly be voting for joe biden this year i voted for trump 4 years ago ill not make the same mistake again lets go biden,9
that was a very good speech i like how he faced those who were against him and never gave in the best thing he said was that you love your country always not just when you win potus is a difficult job and its the responsibility of the president to serve defend and protect all americans regardless of their political or religious positions there are so many things he said that i believe in too and i must say im surprised by how well hes done,9
well i would give that a three thumbs up he nailed it congratulations,9
unreal,9
one of the greatest us presidents ever,9
ngl i kinda needed to hear this biden has his gaffes for sure but ill be damned if hes not the most progressive president weve had in modern history,9

this makes me remember tip oneill announcing the distinct honor and high privilege,8
what a legend,8
yup i saw it mike johnson nodding in what looked to be agreement a lot there must be a conscience lying somewhere in there huh,8
day care is very very bad here in florida i had to pay 300 every week for daycare for my grandchildren 2and that doesnt include lunch and snack,8
standing ovation 4 more years,8

how could anyone not vote for this man,8
i love the fact he put scotus on blast you notice that uncle thomas and the j6 wicked witch were absenti wonder why,8

president biden showed up and showed out great job mr president,8
mike johnson was clapping furtively when pres biden said about ukraine we will not walk away he should grow some cojones and bring the deal for weapons for ukraine to the floor,8
sanity is so refreshing proud to be an anerican,8

a politican tellingthetruth thats refreshing well done joe,8
americans are lucky to have a president like biden,8
whats the deal with the republican response to the sotu address by senator katie britt shes super religious ridiculously overthetop dramatic and pretending to fight tears while clearly and badly reading lines shes a slightly more upscale boebert i am not saying this for snark but shes coming across as a high schooler trying out for a school play conservatives should have done better im embarrassed for them,8
what is george santos doing anywhere near the capitol,8
biden is nuts,8
state of confusion,8
its way overdue to do something about prescription drug prices here compare to other countries,7
uvalde law enforcement were found innocent of any wrong doing those children are gone forever every law enforcement officer who was there will be haunted with guilt and shame for the rest of their lives uvalde county overwhelmingly votes blood red guns cowards are their heroes,7
sick of the republicans congresses giving rich and corporations tax breaks biden wouldnt go along with that kind of bs ever vote him in again four more years,7
if everyone including the corporations and extremely wealthy paid 10 of total earnings we would not only be debt free we would be completely sound with healthcare with feeding children with education our countrys infrastructure would be fixed transportation would be secured families all across the country would be housed,7
that was the best state of the union ive heard in years four more years,7
unemployment is at a 50 year low because 6 items at the grocery store literally cost a 100 dollars,7
vp kamala was having a good legs workout lol,7
lets go brandon,7
stop illegal immigration and get rid of sanctuary citiesat the very least,7
this is the governments equivalent to an annual sales meeting when sales people pat themselves on their backs even when the company had a terrible year,7
just watching the republicans during this speech just sitting there looking lifeless as the president is preaching about all the great things that are happening in america just make me absolutely despise them and never want to vote for them ever again,7
brilliant vote for freedom vote for progress vote for everything this man stands for democracy the people not just money everyones prosperity not 1,7
great speech he needed it he delivered,7
i have really missed ringling brothers circus especially the s,7
regardless of what you think of biden you have to admit he crushes the state of the union adresses its like an entirely different person,7
brandoyou are one of the fewreasons that i regret leaving tennesseebecause i would have been able to perhaps meet you and shake your hand,7
jan 6 lol looked like people casually walking at the mall,7
yeah were getting 4 more years that much is for sure i aint complaining,7
love this brilliant kind wise president 4 more years,7

extra sugar in the ice cream today,6
we need medicare coverage for naturopathic doctors we will save the usa a lot of money because we treat people at the root cause and we are specialist at preventative medicine,6
mtg thinks shes at nascar with a beer helmet not in a hallowed chamber of our government,6
the woman in red cap is so annoying,6
the affordable care act just keeps getting better but i think if biden admin can take a really good look and think about current situation of education during his second term give education the boost that it needs including raising the bar of the schools curriculum widen the spectrum of knowledge to reflect the millennia that we entered entered two decades ago there are disciplines arts and sciences that have cropped up and then improvements in the infrastructure of schools its a gargantuan task but a roadmap with expectations succeeding administrations can continue and pursue will surely rival the aca social security system needs a roadmap too altogether taken biden was great because he did great for his term no one with the right mind can deny bidens achievements greene was more like an annoying fly that was ignored delivery was great because he was mostly respected he deserved it there were moments where he had to repeat the two words that got switched but essentially easily forgotten by those who noticed as i in a general sense it was a powerful speech no country did better than any of bidens achievements the government needs to award more scholarships that are merit based on arts and sciences not just sportsoriented scholarships since theres a wide gap between the haves and havenots when it comes to tuition the rich who could very well afford tuition for even 3 or 4 others should subsidize a scholar 1 to 1 the rich have too much from decades of enjoying favorable regulation from the government they should subsidize other scholars,6
if this wasnt so frickin sad i would be laughing,6
great speech vote blue,6

this guy would give a woodpecker a headache,6

that wasnt a state of the union it was campaign rhetoric gaslighting,5
if you want to do something about the cost of medicinehealthcare eliminate the ability to patentmake proprietary anything related to healthcare make it so any and all research be public at all stages on all levels and allow others to take that research and use it for their own research the goal should be the good it does and not the paycheck it yields,5
one of the most brilliant speech for a long while great speech great job,5
one of his best state of the union addresses the things that went wrong were what was expected to go wrong which was republicans trying to trip up the president people really underestimate how strong the president is even in his old age with how much lies and how much turmoil has been throughout his life that makes you a very very strong person regardless of age there are some things that have happened that ive been critical of the president on or to where i thought more could be done tho i do think hed agree on thatmore has to be done weve done a lot and made it through a lot as a country i wouldnt care if i was in a minority that actually likes the president or if i am hes what a president is supposed to be especially in this day and age i was moved in this speech in ways i didnt expect so much has happened to our country but were a beautiful nation with amazing people no matter what has happened or the challenges to come fascinating evolution of presidency as well as political life and a human one an american one,5
i know i know you know how to read lol im dead,5

wonderful state of the union address president biden the gop members looked like bozos all they want is chaos and autocracy,5
the supreme court is a disgrace politically biased and corrupt shame on the female justices for betraying women shame on all of them for betraying the constitution,5
i think this said it all it is amazing how the media and trump has coloured his term trumps neverending story where sets himself up as something age or not this old gent is a politician what an accomplishment his team has done,5
republicans are horrible people,5
unbelievable america still has lead pipes they where all removed in the uk during the 60s and early 70s,5

traitor joe,5
funniest part in this is seeing the swedish prime minister ulf kristersson standing up with the rest of the people standing up all the time probably not because hes fully onboard with what biden is saying seeing as hes not an american and the head of state of a completely different country just goes to show that hes very polite haha,4

im starting to believe that oj simpson would make a better president than joseph biden,4
in my 77 years of life ive never understood of liked the superfluous ceremony that is the state of the union address its an embarrassment to me the way its conducted is not unifying its a popularity show where the party in power showers praise on its side of the aisle and the party out of power shows disdain i can only imagine how other countries view our ridiculous charade just to hear the party at the helm tout their respective accomplishments and goals for the future the speech could just as well accomplish the goal by being televised live from the white house oval office just my humble opinion,4

starts at 2635,3
very nice mr speaker to standup for john lewis when his name was called,3
watching that prig johnson behind biden shaking his head when the rest of the room cheers is nauseating how did a guy like mike johnson rise to his unearned undeserved seat of power these cc types need to be contained and worked around not elevated to positions of power where they can do damage,3
since i am a parent and have been a registered nurse since 1981 i have the ability to recognize the facial indicators of many body functions i watched president bidens state of the union speech during which mikey appeared to have several substantial bowel movements i am therefore quite grateful that i was not a member of congressman johnsons encopresis cleanup team,3
any one notice speaker of house spent the whole speech shaking his head lol,3
look at the facts i know you know how to read biden,3
mr president you did a great job your message was thorough and direct i admire your commitment to our country thank you,3
not being american it was good to see a president talking about policy and aims rather than a raving lunatic talking about anything but how great he is and everyone is out to get him for his criminal acts wake up maga idiots and see him for what he is,3
2700 atarts,3
i love seeing all the sadangry republican faces in the crowd,3

10 minutes into his speak and if i see harris get out of her seat to clap one more time i think ill hang myself this is so scripted and what are these people gaining to act like they really want him i cant believe america is this stupid so what do they all have to gain,3
a,3
this speech is a disgrace biden and dems standing up for family values while they push abortion chemical castration and more filth get out of here,3
all those republicans are despicable republicans are against the success of this country vote them out,3
worst president in us history gives a state of the union for ukraine not the american people this guy is delusional they did pump his veins full of coca in,3
who gave that speech or what did they dope him up on that certainly was not the man weve been watching steady decline over the past few years,3
he a dangerous clown,3
is that a declaration of war on many groups of people and entire countries,3
he has noooo clue of what he is talking about,3
,3
mtg has no dignity whatsoever send her home shes a classic jerk,3
the freakish rant by this seemingly insane person gave us no explanation for what our next course of action is it was all a fear mongering unhinged psycho rant it was like some angry old man just stood up in a movie theater and started yelling at the screen zelinski is blackmailing him i just wish zelinski would just let the news of bidens business dealings come to light a little bit more,3
id say lets get a lie count going but its pretty much the whole speech,3
if you notice president biden is a very affable affectionate guy with everyone its who he is hes very likable,3
msnbc coverage is the best ever thank you vote blue,3

this is what a president looks like,3
stop finding foreign wars keep our money here,3
h8 anger and retribution thats what the democratic party stands for,3
this man still have the vitality period biden again,3
3230 bro please tell me he did not just compare the january 6th riots to the literal civil war,3
absolutely impossible to imaging trump being able to articulate issues this profoundly and with such understanding and empathy,3
,3
1544 make sure she knows that she cant vape in there,3
ther were many times the republicans could have clapped but didnt whywho are they acting for,3
a room full of evil warmongers dont you all see this 3 minutes of hate right out of 1984 pay attention,3
pretty amazing comments are allowed really important to understand whats going on,3
ukraine is also asking for our not yours our the peoples tax dollars,3
bidens speech left a strange feeling sort of like watch hitlers black and white film speech with people cheering i will vote rfk jr,3
he wants to give us 400 a month for two years everything goes up by 600 a month and then the market crashes game over,3
this speech hits all the important issues that are being blocked by the republican donothings joe biden is a great president and anyone can see he is as vibrant and clear headed as he has ever been he cares about the american people unlike trump who cares only about himself,3
thank you mr presidentyou have earned your titleunlike your predecessor,3
i am amazed this man is still standing it is a testament to the use of amphetamines,3
so well done speaking the truth go biden,3
read by 3rd grade holy moly change how education works and they will be able to read by 1st,3
gop violence against women,3
this is disgusting nothing but lies lies and more lies spouting from this angry insulting senile traitor,3
mike the trump puppet cannot refrain from nodding be a man and do what needs to be done mike johnson,3
go joe vote blue,3
incredeble the difference between trump and biden speaches also what i mist the most is that befor trump the goverment congress and senat used to be working in a great facion bipartisan to try to bether the life of the american people and now since mega it is not appening it is realy sadd i wish that after the 2024 election that there will be a change from mega to republican to restart working in a bipartisan way of governing,3
grandpa joe did amazing,3
the pointless clapping makes this insufferable,3
president joe biden4 more years,3
people talk about pro life vs pro choice i believe in pro choice with limits if people were not so extreme on both sides then you can come up with a solution for everyone the supreme courts did it right by kicking it back to the states take the conversation out of federal talk,3
its election year give us lip service,3
,3
if you still think he is not fit to run a country after this you are living in another reality,3
2645 if you wanna see where it starts,3
vote blue not coup,3
it was like uss iowa skyrocketing over an hour this was the president speaking four more years,3
is johnson is sitting on a booster seat,3
this is what a president should sound like,3
these youtube ads ar getting on my nerves,3
its the united states of america not united states of ukrainer,3
old people should not deside the worlds future,3
i think everybody should watch tucker carlson hes got a great perspective,3
one of the greatest presidents in our history,3
its hard to be a empath and remote viewer its a nightmare may god help us all,3
once again what happened on january 6 didnt meet the definition of an insurrection,3
biden killed it he came out swinging speaks with conviction cares about the country and actually gave me a little much needed hope i love his dark brandon moments as always,3
the nations inflation was really caused by trumps unrestricted spending for a huge tax base by giving massive tax cuts for corporations and the rich all with the blessing of the republicans whom refuse biden student debt loan forgiveness now its time for biden to clean up this mess,3
i will take old with wisdom over crazy and ignorant any daygo joe 2024,3
its nice that all of joe bidens voters got together in one place last night,3
my president,3
come on you tube cant you just give us the state of the union speech without making a dollar on it with all of the inane advertisements really,3
so he doesnt unite these states he divides these states we need a united someone who will reach across the isle sadly until we get rid of the twice party system its like tupac sang i see no changes,3
go biden and speak the truth,3
my main takeaway is that biden started the speech off telling us that we better get used to sending more weapons to ukraine and he ended the speech by telling us that we better get used to supplying israel with weapons,3
way to go president biden they can lie but you just proved them wrong,3
johnson doesnt clap and stand up he sure shows he doesnt care,3
wow awesome,3
100000 a year and dont require a college degree i see you joe i see what youre responding to,3
now thats how a president should be,3
it starts at 2527 if you want to get right into it,3
this is not a seniel old man thank you potus,3
awful lot of bot comments here,3
the presidents cabinet representative as close to the american mix that weve had i think,3
amazing job biden speech,3
gaslighting to the fullest extreme,3
if the inflation is really actually 3 all that tells me is they can always fix it at least election year kinda like when leader of china visited san fran and they cleaned up the city in like a week this is nauseating,3
dayumn gloves are off,3
the glazing is crazy,3
wheres uncle clarence and the wicked witchout on harlands yacht,3
this is a campaign speech and largely repeating the same campaign promises of 2020 those promises have either been ignored not implemented or have not achieved the desired results,3
well done mr biden full marks,3
on the left you have america on the rightrussia notice,3
trump 2024,3
everybody look up the dominion adjudicator mode,3
what a bunch of clowns,3
,3
have to say i love that maga mikes face id behind president biden see how uncomfortable he is sitting there thats the greatest thing to see he knows theyre about to lose big time the maga son the supreme court has sealed his fate guess they didnt see that one coming,3
i it,3
he minced a few words but i overall enjoyed the speechit cameout alot clearer than im sure was expected by those who are on thee opposing side,3
notice how serious the republicans look especially after he said that millionaires only pay 8 tax while we all pay more they should be cheering,3
the maga republicans are showing they stand for party over countrythey look miserable listening to president joe biden telling the truththey wish trump was as honest and strong as biden,3
if someone gets killed with a knife will you also ban knives if guns are outlawed only the outlaws will have guns,3
4 more years,3
smdh biden you alone broke the border and you alone can fix it,3
what a joke like enslaved taxpayers should be okay with any of this booooo,3
beautiful speech,3
he did a good job i still call him genocidejoe,3
amazing man person president,3
supreme court of shame,3
this was nothing but a campaign speech pathetic,3
this man doesnt deserve to speak in front of our flag hes no american of mine,3
that was a fantastic speech the energy that he put into it was amazing and reached so many people i was in my living room and i wanted to stand up and start clapping the man is amazing and you remember the little guy not just the ones making multimillions and just use want to make it easier for us to live in this great country we call home as president biden says god bless america and protect your troops,3
trumps republican puppet mike johnson is blocking bidens border legislation to use immigration as a weapon to stop his reelection its a similar tactic to the one that the republicans used when they reportedly paid iran 40million to hold on to their american hostages until after the election so that regan would steal the presidency from the incumbent carter,3
i felt the love they felt for our president so much class and compassion if you love america you have to love joe biden,3
what an embarrassment mtg is,3
god bless america,3
good on ya joe,3
biden is just a nasty old man with no coherent plan for americas future fjb,3
we dont need new housing units nationwide joe biden we need to have housing rates come down so they reflect the true value of a home and your average citizen can afford to buy one you are pushing out the middleclass and creating only the rich and only the poor,3
are there any republican reps that can stand up with their constituents or crippled by fear have they become robots,3
the world is watching this,3
bidens over here not sleepy dunking on republicans while trump is slurring single syllable words live on tv,3
4 more yeas,3
biden came to rock and rock he did he will win in november and the ratpunk trump will spend the rest of his life in jail,3
wowjoe biden criticizing fascismboy is it so nice to hear a president criticizing fascism and not fawning all over it publicly,3
maisie hirono laughing bernie shoulder to shoulder got to love it,3
thats what i call a president,3
thanks you my president,3
biden is shining,3
mtg is trash,3
excellent thank you for saving democracy,3

president biden 2024,3
im an aussie within the next year or so doesnt matter to me who wins my fear us watching drumpftrump ruin what is left of democracy because we have enough crazy low informed people due to sky news and parent company fox poisoning mainstream and that will destroy sovereignty around the world,3
this is what a president looks and sounds like not that pos that was 45,3
i love my president the best 4 more years,3
hes only saying this just because election is right around the corner,3
pathetic mike supreme court justices,3
love you joe,3
great speech great delivery covered all the main issues in a lot of detail wow increased optimism for the fight ahead biden you want to take away womens reproductive rights my god what other rights do you want to take away biden hit trump hard with blunt statements he never used trumps name from what i recall,3
imagine if any of this was true,3
lies lies and more lies,3
didnt ask for perfect but president joe biden was on top and also on top of just recent topics should say i was in shock bewildered inspired astonished in amazement perplexed,3
president joe biden the sharpest knife in the drawer,3
i love how mike johnson has to sit there and take the truth,3
trump 2024,3
from australia great speech vote blue america for the world doesnt want trump his family and the dangerous republicans leaders anywhere near the white house ever again mitch and kevin sold their soles to look after themselves clarence thomas must step down because of his disgusting wife mtg jim jordan etc need to meade to pay for their deceit to america and locked up get rid of the rubbish and vote blue,3
long live president biden a grown up honest with integrity white house 2024 federal prison for trump 2024,3
god help this country these politicians are all terrible all just deficit spend and spend and spend send all our money to other countries instead of taking care of its citizens,3
i will not demonize immigrants i will not separate families translation i will not deport my political assets,3
the threat to democracy im so tired of these democrat buzz words there is no threat to democracy all these idiots just hear that and say oh we need to vote democrat without even knowing anything thats actually going on,3
whats really odd is how youtube is only putting pro biden comments and anti trump comments on this video,3
biden has a lot of great ideas he is a visionary however the gop needs to get onboard once and for all,3
i just dont feel patriotic when he speaks i dont feel fired up and inspired the way i did with obama with bush proud i cant do another 4 years with this man,3
so many provable lies yet msnbc doesnt fact check any of it fjb,3
if this is what america looks forward to we are finished,3
georgia needs to do better large marge has done nothing her entire time in congress vote her out,3
joe has a 31 approval rating hes not getting a second term lol,3
thank you president biden,3
there is no reason that the other party should be allowed to come on a say the exact opposite of what the president says,3
okay joe crushed it he took it straight to trump and the republicans,3
good job joe,3
why the people are applauding all the time like in north korea,3
,3
,3
fjb,3
no one watched so sad,3
greene what a freaking joke she is,3
even former guys vice president of his one term refuses to endorse trump for 24 hes not the only one either more than half the people who worked with trump in the white house say trump is unfit and incompetent trump and his cult followers can only wish he was as successful of a president as president biden has been he took over as the country was on fire and now usa has the best economy lowest inflation and unemployment of all western countries,2
i cant imagine trump making a speech a fraction of this he has a limited vocabulary even for an orange baby,2
are all the comments from bots,2
i cant get over the smirk on johnsons face he is gonna find out just how different things are gonna be,2
im so confused how did he do this speech without getting lost this is literally the only time ive seen him make a decent speech,2
i have to wonder what on earth have the republicans done in the last 4 years anything anything at all do they care about anything other than dt,2
as a north european that was a bloody fantastic speech,2
joe did a great job,2
nancy pelosi,2
all the devils in one place,2
where is the president seal not in front of joe,2
when i used to live in the usa 36 years ago the minimum wage was 500hour if the minimum wage is now 700hour the minimum wage has only been raised by 0056hour on average during the past 36 years note 700 sek 7168hour sek 1146800month before taxes that is slave wages i get more than that in retirement and my retirement is roughly 55 of the wages i earned when i was working what does that tell you about a 700hour minimum wage,2
if i was smart i would go home now,2
whos the lady that enters with biden at 1724 ive seen her at past speeches as well and always wondered,2
so funny to see mike johnson sitting in the background shacking his head at things he does not support,2
isnt it interesting how the media showed the 1 coherent reply by dt to this but they wont show when he uses incoherent utterances that medical pros call phonemic paraphasia brain damage best stou despite the disrespect,2
he did a great job he was sharp and delivered his speech very clearly without referring to his written speech,2
banks changed recently from getting the majority of their income from interest on loans today banks make the majority of their profit on fees now,2
joe biden gave the most divisive partisan radical and extreme speech ever delivered by a president in that chamber rather than trying to bring our country together he tried to cling to power by tearing our country apart,2
4828 calling out trickle down economics love it the only way we can work is if we work together,2
we are so back baby i love it greetings from europe,2
if a company sells a 12oz bag of chips that only has 10oz in it they are ripping you off if they sell you 10oz of chips instead of 12oz of chips and the bag now says 10oz and not 12oz they are not doing anything wrong,2
same speech 3 years in a row,2
we are lucky to have such a person as president right now,2
the majority speakers facial expressions are so funny to watch sometimes you see him applauding discreetly so as not to be seen by his red ties colleagues who remain stif and rigid sometimes you see him shaking his head like hes thinking whatever,2
compare this to trumps whining poor meing revenge and hate filled selfish rallies thats just facts,2
so interesting to watch liar johnson nodding when he really had no argument but shaking his head whenever possible,2
liar,2
rump is a fup and he really had no right to hide those documents and lie about it,2
at the 500 minute mark my message to president putin is simple we will not walk away we will not bow down i will not bow down my favorite part of the speech not shown on msnbc cnn or cbs why,2
thank you president biden canada loves you,2
biden for 2024,2
yes,2
mike johnson shaking his shameful head half the time whats he gonna do about anything vote everything down,2
this man delivered president joe biden 2024 you proudly have my vote mr president,2
love biden 4 more years,2
mike johnson is a bell end,2
thank you mr president out of the park last night sir,2
i cant wait to see the funny voice overs for this clip,2
love it thank you president biden,2
i was denied unemployment and you celebrate it i contributed for nearly 20 years,2
2222 some old hag telling biden hes the best the best ever imagine living through probably 15 presidents and thinking this joke is the best,2
a mouth will say anything all these suits may believe you but the majority of people who live in the real world know these are lies all lies,2
garbage lying man,2
biden is the worst president in my lifetime,2
wonder why republicans arent clapping when biden says putin must be stopped weird,2
dude ev cars are not safe the battery alone is toxic and can explodebiden is a car guy remember that he will sell you the moon and make get you back so be aware of the sales pitch ev cars are extremely dangerous due to the minerals that have to be pulled from the earth duh,2
then why are we and everyone i know paying more taxes this year than ever,2
worst state of the union address ive ever seen in my entire life,2
all democrats are smiling but a ordinary people are suffering,2
amazing speach mister biden you will save america and shame on you republicans bunch of small people,2
this wasnt a state of the union address this was a campaign speech nothing more when biden finally mentioned laken hope riley what was his response to her death he said thousands are killed by legals that right there killed his last feeble chance to get the undecided vote and without that you cant win,2
go biden fdt,2
this guy is too senile to be running anything,2
3257 we must be honest the threat to democracy must be defended ladies and gentlemen your potus,2
mjt looking and acting like a fool as always pushing chumps agenda republicans keep saying biden is bad but no concrete proof hes worst than chump hes done more in his 4 years than the other guy,2
how can someone after hearing more immaturity from trump still support him,2
play it at 2x speed and hes not only saying the right things but hes energetic and inspirational seriously though great speech hes done some good stuff and really not had major failures,2
amazing president biden 2024,2
thank you lord jesus please give these teachers a raise,2
its sad that people support the republicans and trump why is affordable healthcare so bad its literally free healthcare why is supporting ukraine so bad why do you want to support genocidal dictators like putin have you seen what hes doing in ukraine why cant you just let people live their lives without harming others why do you think letting an average civilian getting fully automatic guns why do you think billionaire shouldnt pay taxes but the broke lower and middle classes should these people dont share any of our values most republican supports in the us arent billionaires or politicians how can this improve your life in any way pls explain,2
such a terrible speech so much hate and division,2
great speech unlike you know who with his mess and stupidity trump these world is ending soon because who in the world would choose trump to run this country really,2
oh pelosi go home take your dentures out she is a disgrace along with the rest of this admin cannot believe people want 4 more years of this clown,2
i am on disability for a rare spinal condition and now a brain tumor and make less than one thousand dollars a month now yet i donated to biden because i believe in him and believe in our democracy go biden,2
maga smug faces are sickening,2
great job president biden,2
you could pay teachers and cops and border patrol officers more and hire more if you democrat would quit giving our taxpayers money away,2
absolutely what our united states of america is about pride respect intelligence and compassion thank you president joe biden and vice president kamala harris,2
ive been a republican for over 40 years voted for trump 2x not anymore no to trump trump is the worst president in my lifetime and he belongs in jail i want to see democracy and decency in america not lies and hatred that trump represents,2
oh my god pitiful he really should be put out to pasture hes an embarrassment,2
so what is the state of the union mr president you didnt mention,2
great state of the union message may god bless president biden and the united states of america,2
man my head isnt turning to mush listening to this compared to a trumps sotu speech,2
biden has more wisdom and passion in his speech than donald trump will ever have in his whole life,2
mrs taylor greene has no taste at all disgusting,2
not bad at all joe i still dont understand how so many low and middle class americans support a party that fights for the rich i guess as long as they say we wont let anybody mess with your guns they dont care more likely theres just too ignorant to understand,2
this country is falling apart im genuinely scared for my life,2
job well done mrpresident biden,2
that is our president,2
thank you president biden,2
smartest thing he said the whole time was his first statement if i were smart i would go home now,2
is it possible that jan 6 bombs found that day were used to force a certification of the election,2
loving america even if you dont win huh funny as the left has been nothing but rabid over america being racist and horrible and how it must all be torn down and burned until they hold the throne then its all you should never go against your government,2
sputter sputter sputter lie lie lie babble babble babble applause,2
saying it louder does not make it more true,2
i wish i could like this sotu address a thousand times well done president biden we are all proud of you and your accomplishments four more years guaranteed,2
what a bunch of bs,2
uhh wat happened to god bless the united states of america at the end that solidifies my thoughts of this being a war between good and evil,2
everything is about minorities white is out with democrats,2
so what was this the state of narnia address,2
trump in his current mental and physical state would never be capable of what biden accomplished here hobbling to the podium like a senile old man and spewing dementiafueled rantings and mumblings about subjects he has no knowledge of then have a bunch of braindead lemmings clap on cue only biden and the libs could accomplish that,2
this guy needs to step down already,2
now thats a strong presidential speech from a strong leader biden is doing a great job four more years joe,2
i find it hilarious he calls martin luther king his hero when he literally voted against them,2
that was a disgrace,2
get magas out of government,2
biden air america is rising 12635,2
you are killing the middle class but jesus will have the final words i guarantee that,2
they clapping like they clap for kim jun un,2
this is what a president should do protect the country all trump worries about is himself,2
they clap like trained animals,2
i have no clever way to say how much i appreciate joe biden yes he is elderly but he is giving his last few years on earth to make this country the nation we like to think we are,2
abortion is murder,2
dark brandon out mic drop,2
president joe biden was magnificent he needs 2 speak like this all the time,2
maga mike looks like a petulant child,2
fight or fix it,2
let ukraine deal with ukraines problems america first,2
watch at 15x speed and he actually sounds better lol,2
johnson looks like hes thinking of going dem,2
good lord cant stand this guy,2
this is comedy lol we need to elect this guy out in light of not having a great candidate lined up we should vote for rfk jr or trump,2
mike knows that if he doesnt look sad and he did theyd vote his a out in a heartbeat,2
look how staged and fake this whole thing is its like watching a movie with really bad actors,2
kamala was off of her back and knees for a bit impressive this must be that progress he was talking about,2
i am surprised by how well biden performed this was his best speech yet,2
biden makes it happen for people and trumpmaga blocks and take away from people should be a nobrainer,2
he may be old but he knows how to do his job and who he works for,2
thank you mr president joe biden a man for all to admire respect support well done sir,2
we need to exit nato,2
worst president in history,2
straight lie when he said cut child poverty in half that is not what the numbers say just be honest and say it took child poverty down 11 to 9,2
great state of the union i support biden and the people of the united states sadly do nothing magas dont support anything except themselves the maga party and donald trump,2
biden is making these republicans look like a bunch of lame brained uncouth idiots,2
i am french i know you all talking about his age i know i dont follow american politics day by day but i am sorry i wish i had a president like that yes he is old but what he said was inspiring with force and class he has experience and he knows what he is doing france is so sad right now so much fears and hates i know you have the orange man too but know that you also have him also and a booming economy thanx to him we have none of that i know french people make fun of you guys a lot and sometimes for good reasons but here is one of them who tell you that you are lucky,2
he wants ww3,2
4 more years,2
so they saved billions on prescriptions and send it all to ukraine how about spent it for people who need it here,2
can we pass a law that ejects hecklers from the state of the union address the entitlement of that obnoxious blonde lady is unparalleled,2
check out bobblehead johnson the sniveling tea boy,2
4 more years and much more tears,2
why wouldnt you just lower interest rates so the payments are lower such a crook,2
speaking truth do not need trump he is a liability to this nation of american,2
they are all so happy coming in greeting each other unlike the gop meetings full of grimaces and frowns and arguments,2
regardless of the outcomes of trials and elections trump and his gop are by their actions russian assets i agree with our european allies who say the united states is a democracy in crisis another trump administration would be criminal catastrophic and obscene we can either be loyal to our constitution and a rule of law or donald trump the two positions are separate and distinct january 6 proves that trump has no regard whatsoever for our constitution and the rule of law,2
powerful insightful convincing inspiring and hopefully motivating to voters of all stripes the president took it to the republicans and the scotus as a canadian i can only watch from afar at the state of us politics in fear because as the us goes so does canada and another trump term as president would be a disaster for all imo,2
that was very good,2
bottom linewhen your faced with a choice between biden or trump i hope americans choose biden trump is a disaster as proven by his 4yr trrm the world not just usa needs stability not more trump chaos and divisiveness in the world i pray americans make the right choice the wrong choice will bring economic recession war on many lands with yoursons and daughters will be sent to fight division and more crime amongst the people is biden perfectnobut hes a clearer choice for the world right now,2
what a money grabn warmonger,2
what a joke and waste of time,2
what a train wreck,2
illegal aliens crashing the borders crime threatening our safety in the streetsand this clown is bragging lets go brandon,2
this mans speach blew me away what a strong moral man this usa pres is all ive heard said hes stupid senile cant b talking about this guy he talks like ronald reagan but i guess you got to be old to have oldfashioned morals,2
bidens message to america dont believe your lying eyes,2
couldnt even say laken rileys name he goes who,2
thank you mr president maybe maga republicans will get the message,2
four more years,2
what a joke,2
did they get a bonus for standing up often i cant remember a wingle thing foe me to even flinch,2
the best president in the world,2
awesome joe in 2024,2
to state the obviousamericas in trouble,2
,2
beautiful and powerful speech by a older wiser legit seasoned respected and strong willed president with vison who cares exposing a pretender selfish wayward clueless greedy con guy who is full of deception remember dems help you while repubs hustle you,2
good job joe we love you,2
the smirk the smugness on leader johnsons face is so annoying,2
can i jump through the tv and smack maga mike please cannot stand his smug look,2
watching moscow mike is pure gold,2

the man has no morals no respect for the american peopleno honesty no character no integrity and no honorand no where to hide in 25,2
the ones who talk about democracy are actually not allowing democracy,2
old man still got it,2
no one is perfect joe biden you said you stood up to fight for freedom and democracy even though you were old at the beginning of your first term you deserve the second term you have looked after your talent well you can see this through may god bless you,2

i have never seen a bigger and more orchestrated group of trained seals these people just clap for anything,2
politicians talk up their own and a countries achievements but for many people reality is much different as they struggle to make ends meet,2
bidan is one of if not the best leader american has ever seen how can anyone vote against this men trump owes putin something big and if trump wins america will be ruled by russia fact trump first started working against americans with the biggest threat the world has ever seen or seen since world war 2 look it up trump made contact or travelled to moscow when he was going bankrupt in 1987 look it up all the proof is there you can watch a documentary about it yet that man trump is running to win so that putin can take a sovereign country ukraine without trump putin cant win mike johnson sat there is being looked into as we speak for taking money of the enemies in russia fact trump must not win trump and maga are as big a threat the world as ever seen if trump wins america will lose america will be sold to russia and putin wins please do not vote for trump vote bidan and america wins,2

biden is on of the greatest,2
the fact that the dems would boo for laken riley is sickening,2

presidential speeches are difficult due to the proportion that is the world or a nation and the nuance of diversity my speech will prosist in the importance of individuality and the value of individual independence and give hope through help individually for people until good beyond not being ok,2
he looks exactly like that puppet the famous comedian uses i never realized that until now kind of funny,2
holy cow did you see the towel boy gym jordan wearing a suit unbelievable not with yellow tie,2

team russia its the west that is provoking,2
i want to this and that he forgets hes the president today,2
what an amazing speech anyone who votes for a republican president should get free mental health treatment im not a committed voter for either party but any american who votes for a republication president declares themselves to be self delusional and feeble minded,2
i knew mr biden would deliver,2
5958 as of today the trump tax cut for the richest has cost 10 trillion that is more than the estimated cost of the iraq and aghpak wars 9tbiden underestimated this,2
look at all those sad and angry republicans why cant they do their job with truth and fairness all they do is fight and create committees wasting time and taxpayer money,2
this guy is an asshat lol,2
to sum it up dont believe your lying eyes 60 of the country is worried about not being able to feed themselves or their families but things are great best of the night holds up a picture of a poor girl who was rped and killed because of his illegal unconstitutional and wideopen border and proceeds to blame everyone except himself,2

mrs biden looks so graceful,2
biden is complete garbage,2
i love joe bidenhe is awesome,2
judging by bidens powerful speech this evening it appears that there was absolutely nothing wrong with his cognition stinky trump on the other hand is making these random rambling speeches mispronouncing the simplest words and not making any sense the difference is night and day between the two men full marks for biden biden understands governance and governing without a doubt and understands completely that he serves the american people trump serves himself and thats about it,2
bravo,2
great job president joe biden,2
if you dont vote for me you aint black,2
this is what a president of the usa should be like truly an astounding and great person for the usa and the whole world,2

if this man is elected again this country will suffer even more consequences mark my words,2
maga mike johnson clearly was pissy the whole time acting like a child while being seen by everyone in the world isnt exactly a good look hahaha but maga as a whole isnt one for much decency,2
please america please come out on the side that keeps us the brilliant people that we have been this is america first a vote for joe is a vote for those that are feeling the fullest and least represented brunt of the true and current state of our union this old fart really is the last stamd of our founding fathers and believe me i dont like that i just said that either,2

was george santos there what,2
joey b in the house,2
if he was smart he would have gone home,2
so openly challenge the scotus to a power duel lets see how many future decisions go your way,2
sad we had a bill to deal with the border and when a complex bill negotiated by a conservative republican landed on their desk in less than a few hours of not even reading the bill they decided it was a nonstarter this is what the hardworking american people are paying those people to do they who sit there with pensions and great healthcare sucking up our hard earned money,2
a president that doesnt have to stoop to name calling like a kid trapped in a man body,2
the speaker of the house is so disrespectful 4 more years,2
demacrats are not even voting for demacrats,2
look at this joe biden the man the right keeps telling the country is incompetent is too old cant run the country and he just gave a speech trump could only dream of giving we watch trump bumble around on stage as biden gives a heart felt powerful speech go joe show those anti american cult traitors on the right how its done,2

thats presidential thank you thank you thank you we are winning by far trump is such a bofun next to biden lol,2
russia asked clinton to join nato but we would not have an enemy then so clinton said no,2
the meds are extra peppy,2
notice no republicans stood or clapped when biden mentioned america being built by the middle class,2
first lie there are currently 97 special forces from nato countries operating in ukraine including 14 us special forces,2
hey republicans the truth will set you free you can fact check everything he said is true biden 2024,2
those disrespectful republicans on the cell phones shouldve just stayed home no one would miss you,2
lies after lies,2
ive never heard a state of the union speech like this it was riddled with so much false information i was embarrassed for him,2
professional politician at work spewing fiction wonder how low he would rate on a fact check meter,2
the best president ever bless him,2
trump and biden are birds of a feather both bought both corrupt both old senile men with warmongering tendencies republicans or democrats doesnt matter theyre both part of the american diarchy funded and controlled by corporate interests we dont live in a republic we live in an oligarchy,2
trump would me memememe meme me me meme me me me,2
best tweet of the night i hope i get this kind of dementia,2
what a clown,2
a lot of powerful people in that room and may god bless every single one of them,2
i love how everyone is praising a speech from a man who hasnt done anything in office for 3 yrs wow the bar is so low for him,2
what a load of crap from the old fool of the demoncraps,2
go ask the union workers what they think joey,2
sell out corruption bidens,2

fjb and all his supporters,2
best speech ever i agree with president biden percent god bless our democracy god bless america,2
great speech,2
good job,2
what a positive delivery so many facts and amazing accomplishments of president biden the republicans were so stone faced on basic human rights how can republicans live with themselves when they are selfinterested and dont care about the american people they were elected to serve their constituents yet it seems like they only want to serve themselves i have seen multiple posts and videos where republicans now limited to trump as the republican nominee say that they will vote for joe biden i am totally fine with that,2
four more years mr president biden we are americans love you sir,2
a complete crock of bs,2
sleepy joe hands down got my vote,2
4 more years,2
you cant convince me that blue and red arent cults,2
stuttering and stammering confused about what hes saying as usual promoting the lefty liberal democratic agenda and doing everything in his power to denounce the right conservative republican agenda joe biden and the liberal left democrats are nothing but dividers losing a lot and promoting the gains of a little is not a win im so sick and tired of hearing about the threats to our democracy we dont live in a democracy we live in a constitutional republic keeps promoting american jobs while flooding our country with illegal invaders most senile president and corrupt administration ever just my thoughts,2
a man with a plan,2
decency has no skin color,2
america needs potus like joe biden to make it great again there should be more potus like him making america great again that has already been very great since its inception,2
so if he gets reelectedwe have to sit around for another 4 yearswhile things deteriorate for a speech like this,2
what a twisted broken world we live in what a comical theatrical performance by everyone involved everyone is in a role in the movie but in this case its real life god help us all,2
what was that guy shouting about,2

all i see is a room full of babylonian k1d ephphers,1
these are not americansthese are the out of touch billionare class of traitors and criminals wake up,1
biden puts trump to shame such eloquence such statemanship he united and built usa whereas trump divided and wrecked usa,1
who actually supports these nutjobs also if biden is too incompetent to be held at a court trial then how in the world is he president,1
hey msnbc thx for keeping the mic on while our president left i loved hearing the crowd tell him he knocked it out of the park and hit a home runso proud and so hopeful with pres biden and harris wow what a speech,1
this is insane,1
who were the two women he mention,1
trump 2024 maga,1
behold your masters now give up that tasty tax money so they can line their pockets,1
ad breaks every five minutes all you did was post a video you filmed with technical errors this aint it chief,1
speaker mike johnson was contemplating life for this whole speech,1
let his days be few another take his office,1
its the same speech as last year,1
look at all the fake conversations going on in the beginning,1
its crazy how much they only want more war and how all these people can lie to our faces dems and republicans serve nothing but their own bs dont worry we are uniting without you and your reign is coming to the end,1
worst state of the union ever democrats love feeding division hatred and fear to get votes,1
i believe the best part of the presidents speech when he kept saying you built america your the reason our country is coming back i never heard him one time say i did this or i did that he truly loves our country and cares about the people it,1
grandpa yelling at me for an hour,1
aint no mistake democrats are trying to push in the one world government my vote for them just so that they can do it,1
i might vote democrats just so they can win and push in the one world government so revelations is fulfilled,1
did he just warn putin i will not fall down,1
why is it when he talks about money i fell like he said lets make our pockets fuller but didnt say average american in the whole sentence,1
deepfake biden its just a guy in a mask,1
what a joke make america great again president trump,1

good job mr president,1
vote blue for progress and prosperity in the country,1
oh hes on fire and not so sleepy now it goes to show you that besides his age he is still a fighter,1
this is proof that if biden stuck with the 2 day work week and his supplier could keep him on the right amphetamines he could stand trial for his crimes,1
one thing i can tell president joe loves to talk i can tell by when he was walking in and leaving he loves to chat jill done had to talk to him about this i bet,1
i cant watch this jokester we are the laughing stock of the world our country has fallen so far i have my doubts that we will ever be great again,1
wow a lot of this is all bogus inflation youre making it worse cant just give give give and think inflation wont happen ronald reagan said inflation is from government over spending this is true less government is what we should be applauding to not this cult leader and his smug vp this sounds like a government over throw all these people are so far left and right its crazy lets all get to a common ground chanting idiots,1
president biden was amazing he will definitely make history the republicans will be remembered as well but as the absolute disgrace of their republican party,1
what a complete joke the only thing he accomplished was to continue breathing low bar his own vp looked annoyed having to stand and clap for absolute bollox would have been better off replacing him with ai that could speak coherently and didnt cough every few minutes 15million new jobs in 3 years bollox thats people returning to work after covid shut downs which btw he also said covid will not be allowed to control us anymore covid never controlled us the government did with their lies regarding covid until some states got wise to it and said no more,1
2650 minutes of crap just start on the speech already after watching i have a couple of observations about bidens speechlies and bs everything good 45 did this imbecile too credit for all his own failures he blames on 45 winning an election by election fraud is not winning and jan 6 was not an insurrection also about social securitythis imbecile has instuited legislation to raise the tax on social security three times in his 52 years in the government,1
same old thing talk talk talk,1
state of the union address but immediately starts talking about ukrainei guess theyre part of the union,1
nobody clapped when he talked about ethnic wage gap,1
fjb,1
this has to be a joke all these ppl really are paid actors we are supposed to be so stupid to really think any of this is true or good where are the adults to say this is enough what you are doing is bad wrong and this is over,1
all the standing up and down and incessant applause was super awkward,1
if you are not a first american you are an immigrant if you demonize all immigrants you are actually demonizing yourself think about it,1
phones need to be banned from these chambers theyve never been a part of it before and it should stay that way,1
what are 3 topics he was talking about,1
amen mr president,1
clearly trump didnt let mike johnson clap or stand for anything biden said dude didnt even clap for ending childhood hunger or curing cancer what a joke,1
the top of the food chain clown show,1
i believe mike johnson is gonna vote for biden he was nodding in agreement an awful lot,1
best,1
121 im glad that in a show of unity for the safe return of the israeli hostages both vice president harris and speaker johnson gave president biden a standing ovation when he pledged to bring them home,1
the next state of the union will see the other side sitting down with angry faces except theyll be booing like children the whole time,1
i heard he was on fire this is elder abuse,1
at what point does this start,1
great speech president biden,1
am i the only one that noticed after he says that theyll cap insulin at 35 month he said american indonesia,1
cesarpalin,1
best speech in history,1
considering the current state of things its probably a good time for democrats to admit that when biden took office and overturned all of trumps policies in the first 100 days that it was just for spite and it backfired bigtime on the american people,1
can someone tell me who the woman is sitting next to hakeem jeffries at 2855 4533 4622,1
unless youre native american you imigrated here stop hating yourself,1
13540 and 13614 and 14113 black people pay attention they are apart of the problem a straight up steven of the movie django matter of fact there was a good bit of pastor stevens and stevens in that room makes me sick,1
mtg must have father issues,1
what is the biggest threat to america right now its not inflation its not the border its not gun control its not ukraine china russia gaza etc its not wokeness its not racism its not the environment or abortion the biggest threat to america right now is the caustic divide being propagated by both biden and trump we cannot survive another four years of either man to quote an old song clowns to the left of me jokers to the right back in the middle again i will not vote for either why because they have no moral character i repeat no moral character im voting for rfk check him out,1
the audacity to say that history is watching when he is helping israel commit a mass genocide and ethnic cleanse amazing phenomenal complete hypocrisy from the beginning of the speech it just shows the beauty of this political system and its absolute corrupt tendencies from both sides if only we can stop giving israel money and help our people instead like end the homelessness crisis help our veterans make our economy better but too bad we live in a disguised dystopia,1
worst state of union ever,1
we can not have equality for everyone while denying all rights to a whole group of human beings here in america children in their mothers womb it is possible and crucial to love both mother and her preborn child,1
the state of the divide can be assessed with three words its a mess russia couldnt have done much better if they had of elected putin himself and let him run off to russia with a suitcase full of top secrets the political and judicial system in america has become little more than a corporate tug of war with bags of money making the scales of justice look like the good ol boys,1
poor bernie with how utterly extreme the right wing has gotten in the past 8 years i fear its going to be a long time until we get a politician as progressive,1
trump is right joe biden should not be shouting at the american people it is the american people that should be shouting at him say her name again joe,1
notice how the republicans never got up to applaud president biden they are so disrespectful,1
theres a lot of people in high places of government that are making money from the human trafficking and drug industry we the people cannot stop the big machine thats why trump must be stopped,1
this usa president 2024 election will be between joe biden the gentleman against trump the mafia gangsterits simply the good against the evilamen,1
i approved my commentgo joe all the way bullies fall end of day,1
theyre all too old old male white its revolting,1
cant seem to keep the republicans out of our bedrooms,1
great job president biden vote blue in november,1
and why was he screaming we all know its an act joe youre pathetic,1
isnt biden the man who didnt want his children going to school in a racial jungle what an embarrassment,1
i have never been so proud to be an american as i am right now with joe biden defending us our rights our freedom and our constitution i have seen many presidents give the state of the union address but none have ever stated the honest to goodness truth like biden tonight vote blue to save us from bullies tyrants dictators and terrorists save freedom for your children,1
roosevelts address hitler was on the march biden is right freedom and democracy are in danger now why did johnson nod at ukraine but he is blocking the aid why does he nod at the mention of gorbochov and yet provide support for russia in their attack on ukraine biden is right history is being made and johnson needs to put the ukraine aid bill to the house he is in the minority how can johnson not see the comparison between bidens competence and compassion and trumps ignorance narcissism incitement of violence and aggression,1
biden sucks,1
boo roe v wade,1
speaker of the house needs his face kicked in,1
and the completely unpatriotic despicable gop sheep outed themselves totally as they shamefully sat on their hands afraid of trump kuschners threats to our them,1
whats the title of this leslie nielsen movie,1
very impressed by president bidens speech but 304 how did he get in there,1
one termer,1
keep up the good fight,1
hope hes wearing his hearing aid with all that capping i meant clapping,1
great job mr president vote blue 2024,1
people in this country have become too dependent on the government to have a real conversation about what truly fair taxes would look like,1
well said mr president i look forward to 4 more years with a leader who truly cares about the usa,1
bots in the comments lol,1
everything he is saying is the opposite,1
dayam that speech was amazing,1
clearly the reoublicans have no class because they never clap to anything even when it will benifit their consticuwents,1
everyone thanking biden as he walks down got super rich off the war,1
republicans cant even stand up for children learning how to read,1
i am saddened for our nation by what i saw and heard in this speech,1
2652 is the speech,1
rambo joe biden floored mafia gangster trump with a right jab and a left hook in 1st round of boxing in the boxing ringits a fastest knockout ever seen on earthamen,1
this is such garbagei only got 10 mins into the speech and im officially done,1
resume aid to ukraine stop the republicans from backing the russians ukraine is keeping russia at bay the republican communist are unamerican,1
a load of horse manure,1
german corporation tax rate is in germany 15825 look at the gpd in us and germany,1
you cant possibly be that stupid to vote democrat again,1
vote trump trump trump trump trump trump,1
biden talking about fixing the border is a joke,1
adolf biden made a disgusting speech further dividing america you cant possibly be that stupid to vote democrat again,1
joe biden delivers another cringeworthy sotu address,1
watching it once was enough terrible,1
amazing speak from biden one cannot compare biden with lunatic fascist trump as trump is even not able to speak he has a baby speech and has no glue about politics and is stupid,1
decree 770 and the devastating effects on romania is all you need to know about taking away womens rights over their own bodies,1
the meds worked tired old man fired up and yelling not a sotu adress more of a political campaign address people are saying cant wait to see how the debates will go when he squares off against trump in nov,1
his opening line was if i was smart i would go home now he just admitted hes not smart,1
brilliant presidential speech by president biden trump couldnt even lace up his boots trump is a disgrace and an embarrassment to america vote democrat,1
why would i have to fly to toronto berlin or even moscow to get a lower prescription why can i get here,1
all a bunch of lies,1
this guy is a joke,1
who expected mtg to be classy and look elegant nobody,1
mtg looks like a that smug look on her face as if shes so clever all shes really doing is making herself you ridiculous,1
joe simply snubbed the big fat liar marge great job mr president,1
the republicans looked very embarrassed when biden urged them to get the border bill passed,1
mtg is just pure ignorant everytime president biden gives a speech and shes in the crowd she has to shout out something stupid trying to get attention but if shes talking and someone interrupts her she throws a fit saying its my time dont interrupt me georgia you can do better than her im surprised she hasnt tried shutting down fort benning,1
great speech uncle joe,1
it seems the republicans are not happy with the economical successes of the country it seems to bother them to see that american citizens even with a decreasing inflation middle class americans are getting back slowly but surely on their feet this should not even be a partisan line republicans are obsessed with the border problem not to be pushed aside either but democrats seem to work more to improve americanss lives,1
acp benefit will end at the end of this month low income peoples internet bill will now be 3000 more a month thats going to hurt,1
this shts a wrap,1
biden is a liar liar liar more crime now then ever,1
canadais riden witb biden,1
mike johnson every time biden says something about what the republicans did shakes his head i think that he thinks it looks like hes signaling that its not true but since i know that it is true it just looks like hes shaking his head like yathat is bad and its making me laugh a lot,1
why isnt that guy next to pamala harris not standing up on the most important issues like gun control,1
this was a disgrace any media who spins this as positive is a disgrace themselves im embarrassed for this country,1
this is literally testing our patience,1
everyones a bot in there,1
you cant love your country only when you win,1
bidens message was so great i keep listening to it over and over again mika and joe i hope youll keep replaying it explaining all the great points in it and not just dismiss it for airing another false trump story tomorrow thank you for your great work love you by the way joe biden listened to you about fdr and put it in his speech connecting the dots about his non oldness youve made history,1
in the end nothing remains but strong words all leaders of declining empires faced this moment but strong words didnt help them and they will not help joe biden joe biden must really be desperate seeing how all his plans in the last two years miserably failed presidents roosevelt and lincoln will turn in their graves hearing the speech of joe biden and seeing what he has done to the united states victoria nuland just left the sinking ship when will joe biden or will he bring nuklear armageddon to the rest of the world,1
someone should create a png version with the 2 people in the back cut out its annoying af,1
mtg is a trash human,1
state of confusion more like it what a clown,1
what in the world was this what a terrible state of the union,1
i love biden such a good man the only one i respect and will vote for,1
worst president in american history bar none second place isnt even close fjb,1
i loved it all except the part about israel it did not start on october 7 and 1200 dead vs 30000 dead and counting is not a rational response israel is a genocidal ethnostate and we need to demand a ceasefire and stop supporting the atrocities they commit,1
yay god bless you president biden we are so thankful for all your good works,1
biden im going to protect democracy by ignoring the courts doing what i want this includes imprisoning my political opponents for crimes the courts determined they didnt do democrats thunderous applause senator from naboo so this is how democracy dies,1
it was a great speech i was happily surprised i hope at least half of his ideas take fruit,1
you fine,1
this is by far the best state of delusion address of my generation,1
go biden,1
looking at this as a dutch political scientist love it my hope is restored after this speech for the us and the world joe stepped up to the plate and hit a home run,1
what a big joke biden,1
im a brityour economy is doing so much better than almost everywherebiden is older than my grandfather but he did a good job tonight and his record is strong but look at those republicans not a single one supports any policy that helps the ordinay working man or women,1
you pretty much just told the nation you dont care about america and you are obsessed with destroying trump no one wants to hear you anymore you are a crook and as crooked as can be,1
the ultimate cognitive test brilliant address he made promises he proved he keeps his promises he promised a healthy optimistic future for america and the world hes the best president america has had for a very very long time next fix ukraine fast and kick the kremlin impostors out of the un russia is not in the un so no need to remove it just lavseat co general assembly resolution next week please just like ares2758 expelled unlawful representatives of a regime claiming a veto in 1971 did 143 countries will vote for it or face electors knowing they voted for violating the un charter,1
i am canadian and i support for another 4 years mr president dr joe,1
trump 2024 trump we love trump,1
as a 24 year old former democrat here in nyc the democratic parties biggest mistake was renominating biden or choosing him in the first place back in 2024 polling suggest trump will win and as a new independent i will also vote for him do better democrats,1
he ate,1
dark brandon rises,1
bsnpc,1
thank god for president joe biden,1

please people explain to me how he can be so alive and well after everything weve seen is it the winter snow really wish he was like this every time on tv which isnt that often,1
what a doddering ol fool,1
a house full of thoughtless clapping rats that didnt listen to the putin interview,1
tooo little tooo late joe aeripio warned all of you in the last 10 years what was happening at the border and now you want to use the border issue as a political tool this whole tax credit for new homes is for the illegals it gives them a physical address so they can vote democratic people cant afford food let alone snacks at the table really,1
joe byron pooped his pants,1
good lord biden is a dummy,1
jill biden the fake doctor we need to drive for female rights moor healthcare they got enough health care they need to stop murdering unborn children or the population will diminish stop this crap,1
what an absolute disgrace to this great country,1
constitutionalist here roe v wade should never have been made a federal law it is up to each state 10th amendment whatever is not in the constitution shall be left up to the states or the people biden cannot restore roe v wade as the law of the land he cannot override the supreme court and no president shall be allowed to do that,1
no it is time for you to leave and all because of you mr biden you disrespect the creator of life mr biden your choices are setting you up for the judgment of god,1
hes barely started talking and im already furious he spews lies worse than any 5 year old caught stealing cookies from the cookie jar,1
i feel like im being yelled at speech writers included every thing but the kitchen sink offering fixes to things you broke is not progress taxing the wealthy more will make more of them go overseas hiring more immigration staff wouldnt be needed if youd uphold what was in place but thats the first thing you threw out take care of our veterans every single one of them medical and housing before illegals social security will not last if we give all of the illegals benefits they didnt earn criminals dont care about paperwork bans theyll get their weapons anyway no intention to do what was promised,1
if i were smart thats where i walked away that freudian slip speaks volumes the dems want to stop putin because the soviet socialist empire is no more usa is now the same as ussr under the dems im getting used to communist life i think its too late these dems want a war with russia i wish usa had a ukraine it would be a nice place to defend,1
wonder just how drunk kamala is,1
free free palestine,1
funny i seem to remember democrats not loving their country anymore when trump won in 2016,1
hes destroying this country stand up for what are you blind,1
what a twisted liar,1
this is deranged,1
now you decide the border is an issue how convenient with an election months away where have you been the last four years while illegal immigrants flood our cities living off americans how about taking car of our own homeless and veteransits shameful something needs to change in this country,1
biden is a wonderful president,1
electrical speech nailed it,1
the clapping politics that forces johnson and his party to stand by their legislationactions by not clapping is hilarious makes it so he cant clap for even the most simple of good goals like preventing child brain cancer or not being a country of political violence,1
yeah if were making all this stuff here in america why i cant get 6 prescriptions pills that i desperately need ive never see this shortage in my life have you seen the amount of money you have to bring when going going shopping 4 more years im going back to spain came here to take care of my friends mom,1
wow look abraham lincolns long lost son of a nation president joe,1
one consolation eventually all are equal in their mortality you cant lie your way into heaven,1
great speak and he means it too bad antichrist trump will take everything away from us humans his followers maga short for magus satanist then there is joe giving to us benefits from our tax money,1
i am watching again so i can see the shame on the justice face they earned it criminals cannot serve in office and be a judge committing crimes for years,1
i cant stand even to look at mike johnson another spineless republican,1
vote blue,1
lock this traitor up no old folks home no ice cream just a metal cage what a traitor and a coward to this country,1

this president and vice president have become baffoons total jokes could you possibly imagine harris as president when biden goes to nursing home,1
permanent cease fire free palestine,1
i have never felt more sold out as a american citizen in my lifewhat a bunch of babby boomers that are crooks,1
crotchety is a good word to describe the old curmudgeons demeaner last night,1
those seals will clap for anything what a disgrace,1
somebody get kamala harris a neck lift man thats some creepy skin,1
americans will not relinquish 248 years of progress into the hands of an authoritarian dictator god bless america,1
hummus green looking so wonderful in all covered with trump all over her and her big mouth that god bless her with and all the other republicans sitting there like little spoiled brats,1
look at his eyes he is evilhie eyes are black like the devil,1
crazy thing is that border bill is 120 billion dollars 100 million to foreign governments and 20 to the border issue people are not quite that stupid yet you cant give us a potato and call it a tesla,1
joe is a master at lying been doing it his whole career,1
act now maga democracy is at stake denounce your dictator king trump this is america if yall want him to be your king set up your little country on an isolated island away from us people who embrace love unity have your king by yourself on your own tiny island and be happy and let us love warriors of humanity be happy peaceful,1
i absolutely love that he moved right past high ranking military officers sarcasm is free from me pathetic,1
the first 20 minutes is as fearful an expedition into the swamplands of america as youre going to get this year,1
man he came out swinging thank you president joe,1
biden is the best,1
10215 republicans cant even get behind billionaires paying the same tax rate as the working class,1
joe biden is the greatest president in his lifetime,1
when joe got elected as president he said that now is the time for the country to be united and to come together to work together for the common good last night his sotu speech did exactly the opposite pretty disgusting this country needs a leader who will not infuse division among the american people joe must go,1
feelgood circlejerk of lies,1
that was elmer gantry on the stage,1
dune 2 was such a great movie,1
dark brandon strikes again i got chills thats our leader,1
they all sit down there with shame in their faces,1
address the elephant in the room biden is losing it cognitively time to just let kamala takeover,1
i would rather have four more years of hope progress and peace than what the other side of the chamber represent 4 more years mr president,1
biden is jacked on amphetamine,1
biden has to quit trying to work with republicans that are just on the side of the wealthy and the corporations time to vote out uncooperative republicans and vote in democrats,1
nothing is made in america read the labels,1
republicans cant even applaud the idea of people and corporations paying their fair share of course they cant grrrrr,1
actions speak a lot louder than words biden why dont you actually do any of this stuff while youve been president,1
4150 biden hasnt bought american he has been bought in america by china ukraine and probably others the only ones gaining wealth are he and his family,1
he acts like the russians are coming but he and his cronies are the ones perpetuating all this all to line his his familys and his buddies pockets guess theyre going to have to steal this vote too all for a greedy senile old man,1
4 worst years 4 worst years,1
4230 the chips act aug 2022 where is it now majority of the money 52 billion was given to intel 39 billion what is intel doing with that money is it weird that the next year june 2023 intel announced an initial investment of more than 33 billion euros in a leadingedge semiconductor fab megasite in germany intel taxpayer money going to another foreign country nah couldnt be conversion rates usd to euros 2022 line up weird how that worked out huh typical american government bahavior just throw money at the problem,1
trump 2024,1
lies on lies on lies on lies on lies,1
booooooooooo not my president,1
this is a bs speech a cheer to a loosing system the greatest military alliance of our time is china russia iran north korea,1
he said that america does not leave anyone behind but what about us americans that we pay taxes and yet he let thousands of illegals into our country and yet gave them phones money and houses and still the right to have a driver licsense and at the top of all this we have to deal with all the violencemy god what a liar,1
biden opens the state of the union by saying hello to dianne feinstein after aides successfully fit the marionette strings to him he launched into his campaign speech it was obvious dementia meds finally met their match last night just so there were no serious embarrassments a fence was constructed around the around the capitol to keep him from wandering off grounds during the speech he received a standing ovation when he announced that he has eliminated junk fees for all migrants staying in new york hotels,1
,1
mike johnson can go straight to hades and so can the sambo sell outs,1
2330 chant 4 more years if you hate the us,1
kamel standing there like holey crap they still think i know what im doing what a bunch of suckers,1

great speech vote blue,1
pulling the wool over our eyes again,1
joe the lion biden,1
stop the bleeding he belongs in a home,1
raise corporate tax and the jobs go overseas brilliant biden has spoken,1
look how easy and how little time it took to transform antiwar democrats in the biggest warmongers defending democracy in ukraine brainwashed ignorant and mad nation,1
trump 24,1
embarrassing,1
they want to save on things to give it free to the illigails immigrants,1
that was a fabulous sotua,1
where was clarence thomas,1
you can tell that kamalas husband is so proud of her and i love that she had to tell him to calm down,1
at 011500 is there a reason the democrats are in white and loudly cheering when biden is talking about the kkk,1
state of buffoonery,1
the fact that part of the audience did not acknowledge the achievements from the biden administration is disgusting these achievements benefit all americans shouldnt that be worth celebrating regardless of what side of the aisle you are republicans are just showing they care more about their vendetta against democrats than the american people disgusting,1
this speech was powerful brilliant generous and forceful biden was inspiring in speaking his future oriented goals the republicans can only stumble and fall flat as they try to hold on to an empty past with trump sitting on all their shoulders way too much rancid fat to carry indefinitely with no purpose other than to save the supreme being what a joke these people are,1
lies lies lies its sad,1
the sooner the true president is back in office the better this man just spews out complete garbage hes good at sniffing hair tho,1
the country wont last 4 more years thats for sure,1
it was a state of accusation not a state of union he failed again,1
hes moving on slowmotion,1
trump 2024 this latina for trump trump this biden administration is the most corrupt and incompetent and dishonest the arrogance these lifer politicians have from us taxpayers is astounding especially they think were dumb by propagating all their lies and always blaming someone else especially trump cause hes the only thats a true american leader not these idiots this latina for trump 2024 trump saved the middle class,1
how does marco rubio live with himself,1
its a good think trump signed the insulin executive order that biden reversed now he needed a bill to get the same thing done that was done yea you may think that the deficit but didnt is cut but you added that to us the people you also added all this money from the students that chose to go to that collage to our deficit the kids made the decision and spend all that money for collage not me i should not have to pay their bill i never got a handout like that completely out of touch with the american people we the people are far worse off now costs are way higher gas and food just to name a few cant take 4 more years of this,1
biden and the liberals the biggest problem in america right now is racist werewolves not the border,1
yes and who are those children your indoctrinated school system is brainwashing trash being conducted on battlefields schools are not safe in any grade,1
and what is hoemala standing and clapping foryalls time is up pack ya bags u moving to a new house all of u,1
inflation went from 9 percent to 3 percent the chip is the mark of the beast this man is nothing but lies led by evil 4234,1
i thought this was supposed to be a state of the union it was a campaign speech all the way you couldnt run on your record of failures mr president so you stumped instead i am in the middle class and for you to stand there and tell us your economy is great was the biggest lie as my pay check has taken an enormous hit for gas food and taxes to tell us you put forth legislation to stop the border crisis is the biggest lie you put forth an ukraine aid package the republicans rejected rightly so you tried to blame republicans at every turn when all you have to do is follow the law of the us and let the border patrol do their job nothing more than that get out of the way of the border patrol and let them do their job but no you tied their hands and then wonder why governors have to do your job and secure our borders also your attempt at influencing this election process by going after trump for some of the things you yourself did is outrageous colluding with das in georgia and new york to go after your political opponent is reprehensible i hope you are tried for your ill gotten gains along with your son,1
funny he mentioned the kkk when he was actually close friends with members and even attended his funeral when he passed he is also the same person who put the law into place that places men of color in jailprison longer than their white counterparts imagine being a person of color and voting for someone who actually put bills in to keep the people of color down yikes,1
everyone is well aware you had to be drugged to show up for a speech late everyone can see its a scam and you are stealing our money why not just say we got ya and leave,1
what a joke vote red,1
we are so happy to see you leave bye,1
who do you want having access to advanced nuclear weapon systems,1
big fat zero this guy is better at dividing the country then anything else,1
biden has no idea on how to unite people he drives the wedge deeper his stupidity was on full display evertine he says my predecessor its followed by what biden hopes is an insult,1
well the sotu has definitely become nothing more than a campaign speech which says a lot about the state of the union doesnt it oh and nice job going after scotus you frickin potemkin puppet,1
this man gets no respect after what he did to the border,1
this clown wants to fund the ukraine war and give free education and health care to hispanics where is the money coming from to fund these country is already trillions in debt taxes are going up,1
this is the first president to be elected by mailin ballot voting what a joke,1
ban the illegal crime cartel that calls themselves democratic they are not they hate the constitution and they hate you every one of you registurd democrats support communism and the over throw of our government your ideology does not work it is a lie and you folks support them no democrats never racism and hatred are all your party can produce santos shouldnt have been there but apparently he qualifies as a past member thats weird but hey thanks to liars like schiff and company we kept him on as a controlled vote a move learned by watching you dems,1
green dressed like a cult worshiper sheep,1
nothing for our military this shows where his priorities are shameful,1
marjorie taylor green is trash,1
fjb,1
and illegals to take the jobs joe,1

3301 the threat of democracy must be defended the guy tells you to your face and you all cheer shame,1
biden biden biden working class leader,1

this was horrible,1
sounds more like a campaign speech i guess thats the only place he can draw a crowd,1
did not adress the deficit,1

this guy is a joke he didnt do anything but attempt to blame trump for everything,1

president biden you cant love america only when you win republicans should remember that and especially trump,1
close the border and then close your mouth,1
notice president biden acknowledged mtg with respect like anyone else dignity by a respectful president and she even acknowledged him as mr president but she makes a propaganda video after shes a hypocrite and when she yells out an disrupts she should have been draged out like any protesters would be but president biden isnt like that having her thrown out like trump does when some speaks out vote blue keep america strong keep americas reputation thank you mr president biden never waver to autocracy or dictator want a be,1

speaker johnsons looks like a puppet of trumps a little eddie munster watch him pout and head bobbing hes a disgrace to the seat of speaker of the house hes one reason the bipartisan border bill wasnt passed it was because the malicious man behind the curtain trump told speaker johnson not to let it pass because it would help bidens campaign and hurt the republicans chances in the 2024 election well our eyes see whats happening an its not going to manipulate the voters still voting blue in november,1

democrats and republicans can work together like they have for 250 years its called compromise the fact that this new republican party wants no compromise is why they are destroying democracy america is smarter than that and there are intelligent ways to govern involving compromise and the simple fact that republicans want no part of it is why the republican part needs more smart people elected to office the elite cabal are the richest and powerful people on earth but isnt that elon musk in that case the illuminati are endorsing the republican party take the maga bucket off your head and realize the facts lead to the republican party wanting to implement the new world order and enslave americans under their blood thirsty laws with their magasty dt at the helm the blue pill is feeding the poor anyone that is still a human being at heart can see that,1
the drug and homeless crisis will continue he mentioned things he hasnt even started in the 4 years he has been in no mention in helping the overwhelming homeless problem but help for migrants who hardly know the history of this country and why they even have the freedoms they do here watch his pre election speeches and notice how he hasnt delivered on a lot of those promises back then also love how he took credit for things he inherited from trumps tenure lol stop being fooled by nice words,1
some one tell cameltoe to sit down,1
marjorie taylor greene is the devil,1
trump trump trump trump,1
joe is cooked in the head hopped up on adderal again dementia joe,1

its not so cut and dry to say that kate cox had a fetus with a fatal condition there is a 40yearold here in the united states with that same condition,1
thanks you president biden fir reminding the republicans where they came from i mean why are only democrats to recognize that,1
wow talk about lying to the american people dont count on the media fact checking anything,1

inflation is a back door tax on all americans,1
lol someones not clapping love it i wouldnt either what a shitshow,1
lol what a garbage speech joe is done for,1
i bet he got some adderall before hand,1

biden and his reckless spending has dug our economy into a hole and sent the costofliving through the roof the worst inflation in 40 yrs the highest credit card debt in our history hardworking families struggle to make ends meet everyday with soaring mortgage rates and skyhigh childcare costs theyre also struggling to plan for tomorrow these progressive liberal politicians live in their manshion style homes not even pumping their own gas while we common fold struggle and try monthly to budget our own rent or sky high mortgage payments while this presidents stands in our homes on tv and tries to convience us we are doing just great why are we suppose to believe this the american people are scraping by while the president proudly proclaims bidenomics is working bless his heart he looked the american people right in the face and lied to us again bc we know better,1
pay back social security the money that the government borrowed years ago vote blue,1

biden is an 82 year old liar and the democratic party is finished and when trump is elected in november he will have to straighten out all the problems that biden created,1
trump 24 we need our lives back,1
blasphemy,1
did biden just take credit for getting the prices of insulin down that was quite literally donald trump that did that,1
if youre such a supporter of democracy maybe the white house channel should stop censoring comments,1
trump still leading the polls,1
what is a woman since you want to be so helpful to them,1
they need comments and thumbs down eliminated on most networks because they dont want people to wake up to the realization that the majority of people even on lib networks strongly disapprove of this man it looks odd bad political optics if people notice this and yet he is elected via thousands of ballots dumped into drop boxes at 1am and counted days late its the same reason why they load him up on medication march him out to simply read a screen for writing he didnt even write himself he isnt allowed to go off script ever especially not for something everyone is watching we have all seen what happens when he goes off script at small local events and they bury the coverage of him falling down stuttering looking lost forgetting words and peoples names etc for major events everyone will watch he gets his meds his prepared speech someone to walk him out and simply reads also because of this there will be no debate because it opens him up to going off script,1
i watched the entire speech and honestly i didnt gain one bit of confidence in the future with this man and his team this was a politically motivated speech not a state of the union address heck he started his speech talking about a useless war in another country that is going nowhere and is depleting and destroying our economy he spoke about the border like if he has a real long term fix that everyone is ignoring,1
my brother was on a cancer drug that cost 21000 per shot and had to receive a shot every month this is an insane cost vote blue,1
most of these people in the hall are all part of satanic cult garcia was talking about the other day,1
there is no insulin available you lie joe,1
impeach biden now save our country,1
i would love to see my prescriptions prices go down cause right now im paying more for everything,1
hunter biden laptop and lies just one that stuck out was 1 trillion deficit cut just bare face lies,1
,1
speaker is definitely a russian asset they cant even hide how uncomfortable they get at the mention of putin republican party is rampart with corruption more so than ever since trump cult god bless america,1
where is fact checkers,1
a poor pr speech for people who dont know any betterbut still mr president you are not winningto the dumpster of history mr president,1
when you start taking away womens rights republicans you should also remember to take away our views ting rights we still have power and we are millions strong vote blue,1
its about control of money and gerry mandering,1
what i heard is more money for the military industrial complex price fixing on products free money for his voters more spending tarrifs paid by americans and political stunting on what should have been an american state of the union we are communists and applaud through it all,1
state of decay,1
great speech by president biden calling out maga for their insurrection on jan 6th and their obstruction on fixing the border go dark brandon,1
best speech ever,1
biden compares the war in ukraine with january 6th its insane,1
would have watched but i hate puking,1
rotten evil politicians,1
president biden 2024 vice president harris 2024 they earned it 4 more years,1
lol the sheep will fall for everything he says funny illegal immigrants started flooding the southern border the day biden took office since day one biden and the democrats insisted there is no crisis at the southern border everything is under control at the southern border now it has become so bad it can no longer be denied polls show the border is voters number one concern suddenly democrats agree there is a crisis at the southern border but insist its trumps fault its the republicans fault and the sheep fall for it biden says crime is down meanwhile new york put the national guard in the subway because crime is out of control stores leaving cities because of crime biden says the economy is great wages are up meanwhile americans are struggling to pay their bills and feed their families americans have record credit card debt record homelessness biden says he created record amount of jobslol the jobs added are people going back to work after covid they are not new jobs now people are working two or three jobs to try to make ends meet can anyone other than criminal and illegal immigrants say they are better off today under biden than they were before covid,1
kamala standing up and clapping lol,1
biden has a program i wonder what is trumps program besides avenging himself for wrongdoings his narcissistic brainless mind deludes him into believing have been done to him,1
inflation is only 3 that would be great if only that were true joe says im a capitalist he hasnt held a private sector job since leaving college tell us about the shell companies with hunter and james joe,1
nato created to stop war now used as an excuse to start it,1
war mongering,1
fix the housing market,1
nato has no more purpose that to embezzle more money the un makes sense but nato needs to go,1
hahaha biden sucks from australia you guys have all been brain washed,1
a real president joe biden masterfully working for you americans,1
all empty promises,1
what a joke of a man,1
i wonder how much adderall they pumped him up with for him to be sentient for this speech,1
we have a pos for a potus,1
what a train wreck,1
they should all be in prison or worse lies all lies and all the people are buying it sad his deals with china ukraine and other countries he sold us out you support the biggest liar thief smuggler hes been selling us out over 40 years wake up hes sending so much work over seas nice job with the immigration issues he will burn this country to the ground,1
remember when biden called black people super predators,1
war pigs,1
republicans sure hate helping americans well except for the ultrarich americans,1
i actually despise this man,1
lets go trump,1
interesting how the first thing you talk about is ukraine what about the american people you are the president of america not ukraine not israel you gave money to them from our tax money without providing any benefits to the american people i want to hear you talk about what have you done for the american person in three years you were here for three years what have you done about the abortion law if were unable to do something about it for three years then why should we believe that you can do anything about it if re elected i am a well paid employee yet cant save any money since you came because everything is 30 more expensive just briefly tell us what were your achievements in three years what is the benefit for america to have you as president nothing you have been busy making and funding wars all over the world all good for your party business of course but not benefits for the american people you never talk about healthcare schooling prices non of your talk interests the american people on their daily lives go be a president of ukraine even israel doesnt respect of listen to america anymore because of you you said it right if you were smart go home,1
oooo sassy biden,1
no one listens to these people anymore they lie and deliver no actions,1
this reminded me of speaches from the soviet union a corrupt evil leader lying through his teeth and a bunch of morons getting up clapping as instructed the baffoon even said that america is safer he obviously has not seen the streets of america after fentanyl one honest person even had to be removed after that,1
yes joe lets look at the facts if you can close it temporarilyyou can close it permanently,1
you said it right if you were smart you would go home now the only wise thing you said since you became president go home be with your family you need healthcare,1
types lets go brandon waits with anticipation,1
how about your billionaire son is he going to pay his fair share in taxes,1
yes imagine because thats the best youll getdemocrats will never spend that tax money on the american people,1
gop sitting there cant even applaud for helping kids they always scream about the fetus but once that child is born under their policies that kid is on its own less food insufficient education lack of jobs because of it this gop audience shows over over again just how much the republicans truly hate americans,1
child poverty higher wages for children,1
you forgot to mention the tax laws are made so corporations can dance around them to avoid paying the percentage of tax that you claim youre making them pay have to change those first but you wont because they pay for your campaign and whatever else,1
brain dead populous,1
maybe they gave him speed to give him that jolt because he doesnt sound like this during most press conferences he usually slurs mumbles forgets or falls asleep,1
best part let me close with this,1
there are so many things we could say about this ridiculous speech but the things we need to do is look at the facts of where this country is what has gotten better and what did biden do to help us we are struggling more now than ever before but people will still vote for biden all because they dont want to admit they were wrong,1
a speech full of disinformation and helping others instead of americans,1
imagine being stupid enuff to still support this corpse,1
history is watching the abomination of the brandon administration,1
nice monolog for a guy portrayed as senile and lost so if that was the goal then why was the middle class murdered their jobs outsourced etcleaving them under educated and stranded by both parties who is partying while the strength of america was done under show us and dont blame shift that is one of the oldest of sins of passing the buck blaming others and not debating merits and resourcing real issues we commit to,1
shout out to elon for letting biden use a neuralink so he xould get through this speech,1
msnbc being subjected to ads to watch the state of the union is pretty despicable the epitome of corporate greed,1
so sad that there are so many traitors in amongst that crowd from australia im 74 yo have followed american politics for years and i really believe that pres biden has been one of the best and will be again please vote blue i would if i could cheers,1
mtgs outburst is typical she doesnt have a respectful bone in her body shes an angry pathetic person and i hope she doesnt get voted back in in nov for the love of god please vote for someone else we need a democratic clean sweep so vote people your safety and freedom are depending on it,1
he seems to think that the supreme court is reading the law and not the political process they are supposed to be an untouched branch of government not a political entity,1
republicans are the ones that want no regulation no price control no quality control you cant blame the president when the legislative branch is the only branch that can craft laws that affects inflation employment taxes and a social safety net the republican side has cut taxes for the wealthy cut social safety net programs created only the conditions where companies can drive their prices up while keeping wages low,1
liar liar,1
the the war mongering cabinet and the genocide joe putting on a show to swing some more votes america atleast trump every knows his ad gender time for joe to hit the nursing home,1
the way he stood up to president clown was amazing excellent outstanding spectacular,1
he sounde great,1
only scum would not agree with whats been said here,1
they were walking peacefully inside the capital think whats going to happen when you literally have a real issue not a paid one america can not continue the path its currently on america will collapse americans are watching and if their voices are not heard and nothing is done these self entitled politicians will have rude awakening,1
the world is watching the gop and they are being found lacking,1
what a babbling fool,1
just a little different than the insulting empty idiotic policyless carnage of his predecessor but theres always the screeching nothingness from empty g,1
here we go youtube with the 15000 interruptions,1
we all seen unarmed citizens protest on jan 6,1
this man lies to our faces,1
well that explodes the myth that biden is too old he was commanding in control utterly coherent and yes utterly presidential unlike the utterly inadequate dj trump on that evidence biden will win in a landslide,1
what are they clapping for,1
took him two minutes to mention trump geez why dont you run on your record oh wait you cant,1
biden probably thought he was at a retirement party,1
its pathetic that this mans admin lie to him he truly thinks he has made things better nothing but lies bs he is so disconnected,1
if this pilgrim wants to restore america he should return it back to the native americans,1
how embarrassing is this old man in our white house he lies its so embarrassing for our country fjb,1
communists,1
harris take a seat you good for nothing daft,1
the third monkey must win because the first rooster is actually competent he didnt start even a single new war,1
hilarious only a few fjb supporters here to comment about fumbling joe and his pathetic admin spewing lies to anyone whose dumb enough to listen im only here to read the comments and comment the delusional comments fyi,1
most of what this man said was incorrect and unfeasible with the floods of illegals thanks to his party,1
biden owns the democrats and trump owns biden bidens entire existence revolves around trump biden couldnt even leave trump out of his sotu address biden is obsessed with trump,1
trump won,1
how many lives have the vaccinations taken lets get that information out please,1
if you want a fair taxation why not have a flat tax for everyone,1
love joe biden,1
12940 man lindsey fix those teeth with your salary,1
bring rents down,1
god loves joe biden god loves us,1
good god what they drug him up with,1
noticeable that the vp and speaker had no interaction with each other,1
less than a year until youre out of the white house,1
the most american hating demoncraps ever assembled in one location,1
i wonder how many times biden watched trumps state of the union to get some key topics,1
american voices were tainted by your mail in ballots and crooked family ties with russia and china,1
biden you havent done a thing all political garbage talk,1
wow,1
theres no crisis at the southern border joe biden,1
it was right at 12000 that he loses my vote,1
mike johnson looks like i missed my weekly tv show for this lol dont worry mike im bored also,1
if only congress will stop being a holes and keep america great we dont need maga for that,1
i know you know how to read right republicans beautiful speech thats my president,1
starts at 2612,1
this dude aint in charge of anything the white house is basically a retirement home the villages,1
national debt rising open borders inflation high crime rates in cities homelessness infringing upon peoples rights to defend themselves bloated government two potential wars lowering the bar for education no more years is a more accurate chant,1
best books reinstate the 1901 mcguffey readers 5th grade arithmetic had algebra one some algebra 2 and plane geometry inclusive of plane geometry so kids in the 5th grade could perform simple engineering equationssquare plumb and hypotenusethat is right folks stuff we are just teaching in high school 1978 they were exposing kids to in the 5th grade the wizard of oz if i only had a brain comes to mind dummied down poor books i know i have seen themfor my children different schools every one of them according to their scholastic aptitudeand i looked through the old mcguffey readerscirca 1901 check them out and you wonder why they are talking head start critics thinking is at an all time low and so is educationsheep are easily fed fake news,1
all you want is their votes,1
january 6th the insurrection without an insurrectionist its been 3 years and not one person has been charged with insurrection,1
he gets so so much backward this is truly the dystopian future we were all worried about the side that used to be decent is now so so far gone trump 2024 no democrats 2024,1
fjb drain the swamp,1
its ridiculous how the speaker of the house was reacting like a child in the back his body language was so obvious i cant believe that the republicans are so childish and want a sociopath to be president again,1
trump 2024,1
the racial wealth gap has never been this low yess cause everyone is just poor nowadays thank you mr president,1
what a lying donkey,1
he sure says democracy an awful lot for not being the president of a democratic nation,1
the actual state of the union my cronies and i are gonna continue sending 10b a month to other countries while making the dollar worthless property unaffordable and our own citizens homeless pretend for a moment that we are actually sending all of this money to other countries for their benefit and not our own we gain absolutely nothing from foreign aid just continue arguing about locking political opposition up forever thats the only thing you americans need to concern yourself with were america for god sake we can fund wars all over the globe and i can still make half of you all think its the right thing to do trump bad political money laundering good,1
i love joe biden,1
is texas or alabama the gilihad from the handmaids tale,1
look at all of these dinosaursffs it looks like a 50 year high school reunion 2 minutes into the speech and he already is mumbling the state of the union is supposed to uplifting to the nation of the united states instead he spends this time doing the opposite bashing the other side of the isle talking how we should help other countries instead of focusing on our own issues this address was an absolute joke glad its his last,1
so this is the best we got this is the best candidate for the president on the democratic side and trump is the best we can do on the republican side 2 guys that should be drawing social security politics are a joke time to start waking up and realizing these people that have been in office for a long itme and its just a call of confusion every 4 years nothing changes nobody is genuinely there for change while they are buying their 3rd and 4th beach homes americans are struggling to pay bills rather than address our problems they are too worried about pointing fingers at an incident that happened years ago its like a tattle tale game between preschoolers,1
bla bla bla,1
why are they recording a retirement home ohh wait its the state of the union,1
youre wasting air trump will be our next president,1
republicans have long forgotten they are supposed to act like a statesman,1
my friends across the aisle theyre cardboard cutouts mr president they havent moved,1
why you always lying,1
anybody here thinking putin is the good guy is themselves monsters also,1
crook,1
we would have a better country if putin was president over joe biden,1
how about taxes and inflation turd,1
trump 2024 i dont personally know one person who is not voting for donald trump i even know people that hated that guy but are now going to vote for him because joe biden is destroying the country,1
biden murdered laken reilly with his open borders and then he dishonored her memory by mispronouncing her name,1
the republican party is dead its just a neofascist cult now,1
great speech,1
i was hoping for attachedearlobe biden i thought the vp speaker did a good job barely reacting when joe thought he was running for congress,1
now thats a real president pity the mary lego presidente couldnt make it,1
mr mcgoo,1
president biden has made america great again and he will bring it to even greater levels if reelected 3,1
my president,1
he ate i fear,1
cocaine tonight joe,1
i dont want a democracy i want a republic,1
funny kamela harris just ignored moscow mike in the opening he behaved like an underdog bowing and being subdued what a jurk and lowlife from norway,1
3 inflation is not correct its more like 79 unfortunately it seems that politicians on both sides are out of touch as to what is important to the people of america they all pay us lip service and get rich off of the backs of those hard working americans that prop up the companies that put money in the pockets of politicians more and more americans are feeling the squeeze of regulations that cost us all money and benefit the privileged few cost for education has soared while the quality of that education has fallen small businesses are closing at rapid rates leading some communities no choice but to turn more and more to big business that pays little and has workers that are still on assistance programs that cost the tax payer thus subsidizing the company low pay with tax dollars wanna make politicians accountable set their pay to the median of the state they come from get rid of their lifetime health care get rid of their ability to receive donations and freeze their investments while in office remove their and their immediate families ability to interact in stock investments while in office wanna make the wealthy pay their fair share with the tax codes switch to a 10 purchase tax on all goods and services and get rid of the irs that way those that buy more will pay more the border that problem will end when we start hard deportations without exception but we are not doing that we are spending them all out in the country an we are seeing the results in chicago and new york and all over the country governors are asking people if they want to volunteer to help by opening their homes to illegals to help with the burden on the taxpayer yet shifting the burden directly to the taxpayer yet housing illegals is supposedly illegal and working them is also illegal supposedly all of these problems are actually our fault the people of this great country as we are the ones who elect all of these politicians we have not stood up for ourselves but we have let politicians run ramshables across the country the failures of the country rest on our shoulders,1
president bidenhas been doing his homework,1
speaker johnson i think is having his seat as the speaker but the last sit because he failed as a speaker he chooses evil over good he will be the worst speaker ever lived enjoy your last laugh speaker johnson,1
mike johnson is looking weak uncomfortable and just impolite voters on the fence will choose president biden and democracy over lying conspiring and angry people who have no idea how to lead america,1
the republican party is truly the enemy of the people just look at their faces when a great policy is announced,1
mike johnson is a clown,1
diz o senhor 0 tu tá vendo o meu 0cesar,1
never heard so much,1
im very proud of our president he is trying to fix the border trump has told these stupid republicans to not pass the bill so he can run on that i cant wait until november when they have lost again standing there looking stupid from listening to trump,1
the gop sitting there in the own dirt stink indignant in judgement my god what is wrong with them,1
the speech is great but its just a speech the country is not in a good place and has not been since he took office cost of living is out of control for many americans border is a mess thousands of illegal military aged men pouring into our country and we dont know who they are or where they are if biden could deliver a fourth of what he says it would be impressive i only want my country to be great again no matter who the president is godbless america,1
america is gone insane,1
what about reclaiming the lakes that used to flow in death valley so 13 more usable land is created like for planned for til interrupted by word war 2 we have solar to pump the waters from the pacific desalinate and collect then at enormous rates very low cost and the rains trapped between the mountains will water down 7 states when the rain fall once again restarts,1
what a pathetic horror show with a senile warmonger and a korrupt senate that profits from a war economy,1
looks like biden will get 4 more years,1
apparently letting illegals from foreign enemy countries into your country is now defending democracy got it,1
some gops believe its 2020 haha but what me really shoked the gop didnt clap when the president say good save america and our troups,1
worlds watching a gaslighting fart box of lies,1
joe is graceful in comparison to the rude and uneducated donald,1
presidents cabinet sucks so far,1
the only threat to democracy is joe biden and his administration,1
the former president failed and refused to take responsibility during the pandemic,1
wow that was powerful,1
sounds more like brandon is blaming everybody else for the problems of this country and not taking responsibility himself sure would have enjoyed hearing him talk about the united states instead of the rest of the world what he did say about the us and whats wrong with it has everything to do with his failed policies no joke,1
why does mike johnson look so uncomfortable,1
to the speaker of the house mike johnson why are you and the members of your party letting war criminal putin gain momentum in his aggression against the democratic nation of ukraine,1
my ears can hear it but my eyes do see it,1
the maga are acting like petulant children shame on them especially margery traiter green,1
china prime minister liqiang just delivered china government report in its national congress meeting this week quite interesting to compare li qiang report with bidens which one is more professional,1
i dont know what everyone is clapping for thats not the president of the american people,1
no its not,1
when you raise the minimum wage price on everything goes up lol,1
i must say it is pretty ironic hearing the same man who mocked freedom a few years ago claim republicans are trying to take freedoms away,1
should sum it up all lies as usual total waste of time,1
excellent speech dear president joe biden you can take the republicans down without mentioning the republicans traitors,1
this is crazy republicans not even clapping for child education,1
him be honest and he wont speak about jan 6th because they let them in,1
devolder santos attending,1
849,1
how much of hunters coke did it take to get through that speech,1
starts at 2648,1
the republicans look pathetic too much facts truth theyre choking,1
who let the street vendor into the oh thats actually mtg,1
what an embarrassment to the countryelection stealersdrugged just so he can speak coherently,1
mtg and mike johnson and all the other maga has shown they are not fit to represent their constituency please vote all them out in november by voting blue throughout the ballot,1
everyone in this country is hurting you do nothing to help this country,1
close the border stop bleeding out our nation take care of americans first,1
the speaker should have never shook his hand and thrown the speach on the floor every republican should ha shouted him down nonstop till he left the building,1
biden hit a homerun with this state of the union with all the good intentions and accomplishments biden is talking about not 1 republicans not even clapping when its all good for america it really tells us who is for america and who is out for themselves trump divided us,1
half that room is older than dirt,1
he cant even speak clearly for a national address i say this as a registered democrat,1
joke biden president of sodom and gomorrah,1
omg here we go again with jan 6 bull crap dems stop push jan 6 nobody cares yall did it before too,1
this is hard to watch i dont feel like he is in touch with the people at all and what we are going through right now,1
enforce the immigration laws that already exist this will solve the border crisis no need for more legislation or to throw more money at it,1
this creepy old man is done,1
so one fact is true the president of the united states joe biden,1
big corporations not only need to pay more in taxes they also need to show that they share those additional costs with the shareholders and dare not reduce the earnings of the workers in their plants and offices,1
mike johnson couldnt squirm harder republicans fell for it again joe got them to agree not to cut taxes for the wealthy then they fell for the same trick with the border,1
garbage,1
totally embarrassing that this mumbling corpse is our president he is a domestic threat to america democracy and our constitution,1
pretty impressive and forceful speech then again biden has some real achievements unlike the babbling orange incompetent and mendacious drooler,1
biden is a joke the world is laughing at the address and his left wing nut job supporters,1
compliments must have felt really good to hear,1
интересно какие препараты подействовали на байдена что он ни разу не поздоровался с богом а так конечно он живчик,1
great speech from joe biden he was on fire,1
worst president ever this was just sad go team war mongers,1
too many promises to spend more money that we dont have get the national debt to zero before thinking of more government spending raise taxes if needed,1
i am fascinated by the whole show i wanted bernie i didnt get mad at the backstab and vote the other team outta spite and then find myself having to justify it for the better part of a decade but i was close i get the feeling that the whole system is corrupt and needs a good wash but people went off the deep end voted a demagogue in that had an unwatchable show and whats he done since play worlds biggest victim dont do crimes maybe,1
raise corp tax so it pushes them out of the country smart 500b over 10 years kinda like the 600 billion he sent to ukraine and israel,1
a very dangerous mouthpiece a puppet for the deep state,1
biden wont bow down but hell fall down,1
biden is very good at lying,1
great to see johnson squirming in his seat he wants to slide down under table in front of him,1
it seems to me that the democrats have no idea of how to move forward so they have resorted to lying to the american people ever time their entitled mouths open,1
wars all around the world ragging thanks joe biden great policies,1
why didnt he brag about the exit from afghanistan another example of incompetence,1
bless biden for his honesty,1
booooo,1
a man who can make a speech like this is perfectly fit to be president biden is a builder trump is a destroyer however the 2 state solution in palestine is just not possible for two reasons firstly hamas do not want it they state very clearly in their charta that the only solution for them is a holy war jihad against israel and that all international peace agreements are a waste of time and contradict the principles of hamas if you dont believe me look for yourself the second reason is that israel knows this,1
with all due respect justices women are not without electoral or political power you are about to realize just how much wow the president threatened the supreme court justices its amazing how many people are cheering that on,1
his son was not murdered how insulting to say he knows how her parents feel unreal insulting beyond measure,1
wow wow president biden really put the screws into traitor trump and house republicans maggots in their places condemning trumps praises and encouragement to putin to attack nato way to go mr president youre really an intelligent smart gentleman very compassionate,1
biden 2024,1
an amazing man and an amazing president,1
biden biden,1
,1
the fact is president joe biden and his predecessor donald trump were both eager to withdraw us troops from afghanistan and end what biden referred to in his aug 16 speech as americas longest war the trump administration in february 2020 negotiated a withdrawal agreement with the taliban that excluded the afghan government freed 5000 imprisoned taliban soldiers and set a date certain of may 1 2021 for the final withdrawal and the trump administration kept to the pact reducing us troop levels from about 13000 to 2500 even though the taliban continued to attack afghan government forces and welcomed alqaeda terrorists into the taliban leadership biden delayed the may 1 withdrawal date that he inherited but ultimately his administration pushed ahead with a plan to withdraw by aug 31 despite obvious signs that the taliban wasnt complying with the agreement and had a stated goal to create an islamic government in afghanistan after the us left even if it meant it had to continue our war to achieve our goal,1
are you seeing the repigs hating bidens calling them out for being the traitors we all know they are the repigs cant stand up for americans they stand for a russian puppet they stand for trump the traitor and insurrectionist against america its time to clean our government out of these traitors these corrupt criminals who are occupying our government offices,1
can some american please explain me why middle class americans support donald trump it makes no sense,1
what america needs is guidance and without a shadow of a doubt i believe this is the man to lead this nation into the future,1
cheers to you joe,1
joe nailed it again and again,1
lies and false promises,1
100 bots in comments the gaslighting is insane trump 2024,1
biden is going to win,1
what a joke,1
a bunch of delusional people all in the same room,1
full of craps and nonsense,1
4 more years for mrbiden god blessed america and mr biden and his cabinet,1
you will know gods chosen therefore by the fruits they bear you will know themmatthew 71520,1
is this state of the union or state of ukraine why start with ukraine the most corrupt country in europe this is purely propaganda for ukraine aid so joe can again get his 10 cut not a state of the union history is watching according to joe yes they are watching a theater by joe biden and his fellow treasonous marxist communist demoncrats that have been destroying our country since november 3 2020 when they rigged the election to their favor,1
the state of the union address was not supposed to be an attack on your opponent and if you actually look how long biden speech actually was it just proves that the left is afraid that he is unable to perform his duties,1
vote blue across the board,1
dump the chump 2024 vote blue,1
something smells can anyone smell or awake come on this means nothing just words looks whats going onthese are practiced in front of a mirror,1
sit down kamala,1
i bet if biden was asked by any of the spectators what is my name he would not know thats dementia for you,1
great state of the union speech of j biden well done joe bravo sorry but it is funny to see all the maga people wearing their dt uniform most of them are wearing their red long tie they look so ridiculous m johnson looks so uncomfortable i think inside he would like to stand up and applaud biden as well,1
the house and senate republicans do not like what they are hearing it bothers them to hear the truth i will never understand why anyone would ever vote for a republican candidate they have zero interest in helping their constituents they know how to tell everyone what is wrong with our country and what to fear but they never offer solutions to fix those issues for the past decade the republican legislators have failed the american people the republican party has lost its way,1
ok president biden sir,1
and not one time was the word republic said we are a republic not a democracy god bless american was left out this dude,1
way too many applause breaks the cheerleader behind him thought she was at a pep rally,1
blah blah blah what a clown show,1
nato creates wars and destroys societies,1
7 bucks an hour is an east coast thing the owner of our restauraunt called it grand fathering and he was protected due to the fact the he opened the restaurant in the 80s,1
let this old man die in peace democrats why are you torturing him so much,1
nothing but hate speech and incoherent ranting keep the war goingblablabla only another 60 billion and we can win this warblablabla,1
id like to see an edit of kamala standing up and down boing boing boing boing boing boing,1
how embarrassing for the republicans biden was nonstop highenergy espousing an incessant cornucopia of victories and goals moving forward talking articulately in full grasp of details on such a wide range of issues meanwhile the gop has done squat for the last 4 years and can you even imagine trump giving a coherent state of the union speech biden stumbled in a few spots but just momentary and nothing major nothing indicating the aphasia and neurological degeneration that trump has been showing lately biden is old but seems in good health better higher functioning than trump let alone the gargantuan difference in where to take the country,1
imagine democrats acting like they are leading the front of protecting the border literally the one thing they ran on was trumps stupid wall such snakes dems are remember when they said gas prices were going down and that inflation is down do they think we dont fill up everyday and go to the grocery and dont forget how covid and blm magically faded away and make sure when you see how much was taken out when you do your tax returns that it went to another country to fight a war and our homeless vets who fought a war for us get nothing if you are broke just remember they gave migrants money and if you dont like all of this then you aint black,1
now go watch trumps and see how great he looked get some perspective for once they all look amazing at these things luster wears off though,1
they never stop talking ab democracy like thats my biggest problem,1
dont get me wrong the dutch government is horrible we had over a decade of conservative rule where the power of the economic market was paramount so much was destroyed that now must be built up again infrastructure health care education rediculous that every hospital must make profit every school youth care facilities care facilities for the elderly we had elections in november and ultra right won a trump copy i am deeply ashamed,1
lets go brandon,1
love seeing kamila standing behind her president clapping,1
what is kamala on now she mustve got some booger sugar from the kid that biden has left,1
way to go joe,1
this is a money laundering team no student loans were forgiven trust me i know,1
i will vote for any candidate who promises to legalize cannabis on a federal level,1
no ukraine cannot defeat russia and yes we did commit an act of war by bombing the pipelines that give energy to many in europe yet we pretend to be on the sidelines russia is not our major concern it is china and we have driven a strong alliance between china with over a billion people tons of money and influence and russia who has many natural resources and nuclear weapons way to go biden and the war mongers who back you,1
what a remarkable embalming job someone did on him he almost looked like he was alive incredible,1
everyone here talking about johnson clearly has a leftwing attention memory span i guess pelosis stunt at the sotu was brave inspiring,1
i wanted to hear were going to mars before the end of the decade,1
самая молодая геронтократия планеты,1
im pretty sure these are bots in the comments nobody can take this dementia victim had a on acceptable speech must less state of the union address how many gaffs did he have he could barely speak,1
he actually pronounced toronto correctly all jokes aside as a canadian this is a good man if you people elect trump instead of him youre complete idiots,1
biden and harris 2024,1
earlier in the speech brandon said that there was a vaccine for cancer,1
johnsons face looks like he has a bad case of gas,1
excellent speech excellent state of the union by president biden top notch speech on every important issue vote blue across the board,1
bravo president biden a real president,1
history is watching that youre the worst president ever thats why we the people are going to vote you out trump 2024,1
yeaaah not voting for this dude dinosaurs are cool but i dont want one running the country,1
fantastic speech,1
i really really hope that the scotus got ashamed or in the case of corrupt justices angry so much that they were on the verge of exploding what a shame of them,1
what a fiasco there should not be a smile on anyone of those peoples faces the state this country is in they should all have a somber mood because they all are driving this country into the ground ive never been so disappointed in our government and i mean both sides of the isle there was nothing said or done or resolved that deserves an applause that aint no swamp its toxic landfill,1
biden speaks to things all americans can get behind but still the republicans sit with no show of support they truly dont care about america or progress just their own bottom line,1
what a joke,1
oh now i get it i was trying to understand why they let joe take so much time being greeted upon entering hugging and kissing and shaking hands with everyone and being applauded for so long this makes mr dt stinkypants absolutely insanely jealous he must have ketchup everywhere,1
biden 2024,1
why people supporting biden hes a warmonger supporting cult of militarism and woke ideology,1
he covered everything now lets hear from republicans,1
garbage speech from a garbage president,1
all hypocrisy everything thing he says is bull genocide joe wants to talk about russia but is helping israel to take all of palestinians land he undermined the un with veto votes just a bunch of theatre,1
biden speech will go down as one of the most profound yet one of the best in history,1
speaker johnson you are a coward and a shameful blemish on the united states of america you should be ashamed of yourself for not standing for the people of the us or with the us constitution you should resign you disgust me,1
johnson is disgusting despicable and antiamerican look at him as biden is talking about the wins of his administration and the destruction from the trump administration johnson is a puppet he is a dangerous puppet,1
yeah us government us government us government,1
love president biden,1
great speech jo unfortunately you werent under oath so did not need to stick to the truth,1
maga mikes face has me crying,1
i see the crooked judges i wonder how much they are getting from russia,1
very nice camera job,1
supreme court justices should be ashamed of themselves they dont want to serve justice they want to serve trumps agenda,1
biden has created the divided states of america,1
you understand politicians say anything to stay in power this is all a hoax politicians have ruined this country they put up an old man with no memory in the white house and it caused the ukraine war you guys should be held accountable for believing in this nonsense,1
usa is the best because of the best politicians like biden,1
i just wonder how much they pay for the clapping and cheering after he chews up his words,1
putin doesnt want ukraine he wants stability the rights abortion policy is lunacy is it right ehh kind of not is life messy yes do these folks have the right to judge no his rhetoric on infastructure is something to be admired and i hope his words reflect reality but in all honestly i feel bad for this man he is asking for war and throwing all diplomacy out the window this address had its inspiring moments and incoherent moments i could have done without the separatist rhetoric we need truly need leaders not politicians we need someone whose name is unkown because our options provide nothing that the american people or the world deserve joe im not a fan but tonight you blew past my expectations and i feel hopeful and wish you and us all the best ps why was bernie masked up,1
thought was interesting seeing sen boebert wearing blue jason b lincoln nebraska,1
great job joe,1
trump train dont stop,1
great speech 4 more years,1
a trump speech jabber jabber jabber blah me blah hate sneer yawn me me hate fumble blah blah me victim me victim blah sneer silly names hate blah me me me,1
trump 2024 to save america,1
its time we become isolationist once more mr former president like in the days of pre ww1 we need to count our losses monetarily morally and build from the ground up our institutions focus on the american people america is first if the citizens at home struggle with jobs violent immigrants housing not shoebox living rising cost of living colleges being incentivized and 100x more than their worth tax dollars being sent to the third world instead of our infrastructure homeless marauding the streets never ending proxy wars we most focus on the american people trump 2024 hopefully rfk vice president vivek 2028,1
why does bernie wear a mask for part of it then has it off later maybe just helping to save oxygen for the others,1
20 billion dollars of junk fees sounds suspicious,1
i am genuinely and utterly disgusted at the amount of republicans not cheering and applauding the progress america has made because democrats are doing it they have truly forgotten theyre 1 half of a 2 sided government,1
poor pathetic maga mike didnt clap for democracy freedom womens rights fair elections peacesful transfer of power nato america or world freedom what a sad clown a reflection of his deluded lying boss,1
dems love to pretend that bcuz reps dont want an open border that that means they are against immigration this is a bold face lie we take in more immigrants than any other country and have done so for while around a million a year i believe all we are saying is come in the legal way for two reasons one so we know you are not a criminal or terrorist and two so that we know you can benefit america and be self sufficient,1
the illegal immigrants will not be deported they will get voting rights he lives in an air bubble what happened to reality and truth,1
this speech has awakened the rest of my inner patriot 455 stars yes things have can and will get better in this country why because were americans were supposed to be stubborn independent and not take things laying down also the challenges we have now we have faced before look at our history see a pattern weve got this want more unions and protections for said unions let yourselves have it want seniors to get better ss and medicare benefits let yourselves have it want affordable healthcare and education let yourselves have it want living wages let yourselves have it want affordable housing let yourselves have it well dont just stand there contact your representatives vote sign petitions vote volunteer at the booths vote grab your megaphones and picketsigns vote grab your choice of brick vote get in touch with the people in your community and vote there is no i in team here so the more people get involved the better its all about strength in numbers we got this,1
go joe vote,1
how can you give a child a good start if you and cackling cameltoe want to abort them all brandon,1
this comment section is full of bots real america sees nothing in biden that is good for our people,1
trump 2024,1
go biden,1
i didnt hear any mention of the high food prices or the drug cartels invading our country do any of you commenters actually live in america what kind of person gives a state of the union address while ignoring the suffering of its own people,1
applaus of the union,1
his ideas about the are moronic,1
they must think were stupid or something,1
,1
stephen colbert is a paid puppet for the woke mob,1
imagine believing all these pro biden comments arent all bot accounts,1
incredible how many lies they wrote up for biden to spew tonight the first half of the speech was full of bogus claims and skewed statistics trying to paint an economic picture totally at odds with reality many policy proposals were taken straight from the republicans and will never be seriously pursued all crafted to deceive it was a dizzying orchestra of propaganda but he did manage to hold himself together sufficiently i guess it was worth pumping him up with all that prevagen neurogen ritalin hunters cocaine and blood transfusions from two young children so he could get through that speech even though not a glimmer of truth shined out of it,1
good speech too bad there is war around the world when we had peace under the last administration the economy is far worse the farmers arent being cared for as well we shut down our oil production our transportation systems have been having catastrophic accidents pharmaceutical costs are much higher its weird that people can listen to these words and not have them line up with reality i didnt listen to trumps speeches but understand that those who did didnt like some things he said but i could afford to live support my family and save some not anymore so thanks mr biden for that,1
wheres a lip reader when you need them,1
we will not walk away this stand up to tyranny stand up to russia and dont just do nothing when bullies hurt others thats what america wants to pretend it believes in and i want it to be true but it wont if we let ourselves forget the importance of freedom and democracy around the world so yeah i liked the speech cause ny stance will always be the same never vote for a fascist never surrender to a facist never believe that a fascist has your best interest at heart anything else is a betrayal of everything we have created and everything the modern free world stands for,1
we hear the same speech from all these politicians how theyre going to hold companies accountable and make them pay there share meanwhile they make the consumers pay,1
hey americans just here to tell you that your country is doomed and it has nothing to do with this speech the left cant say anything good about the right and the right cant say anything good about the left thats all decades from now when the us is split into two factions youll remember rome,1
im a european whos the lunatic shouting at min 11721,1
mike johnson a study in uncomfortably eating crow,1
the middle class has been disappearing because it now resides in jail cells and prison due to the corruption of this man dating all the way back to the 70,1
you people warming the seats are soon going to be warming their couches at home,1
biden is a joke,1
if only he did what he said a great politician who says he wants to tax the rich he is rich to give it to the poor he will not give a dime to a poor homeless person go uncle joe,1
shut up toilet greene blue your fired bye bye toilet greene,1
maga aino god bless america,1
mr president abortion is not a male vs female issue if you believe that come to austin texas for the annual texas rally for life there will be about 1215000 people there and women vastly outnumber men,1
looks like mike johnson agrees with everything biden says hes a traitor,1
he is not under oath so can say anything the assistance to ukraine is linked to an open usa border how would you like that when putin and china are your neighbours,1
joe biden is assaulting the second amendment he wants to take the freedom of americans away to protect themselves little by little thats the freedom he wants to take away because hes a dictator,1
if you believed one word of this or are acting like an hour of lies was a success you are not going to be remembered well in history americans cannot fundamentally coexist with a delusional cultterrorist organization like the democratic party,1
i wonder where all the money for his big plans are gonna come from do any of you people think about this stuff how its gonna affect those paychecks that support your families in the us government spending comes from your pockets not the governments this is not free please think about that im not a trump follower im not a biden follower im a people follower and i all i see from this speech is more money being pulled from our checks to be used for things that are not in the best interests of the people its wack it really is,1
why is the speaker of the house johnson keeps shaking his head and not even stand and applause on most of what pres biden was saying really hes already thinking well not go along with that,1
hurry up and go back to your basement let the real chief and commander get back into the house and handle business americans all over the world are waiting for trump to get back so he can save america from what youve done you should be held for treasonand crimes against humanity and so much more,1
whatever it took to boost bidens stamina through this single long speech did not remedy the mans serious flaw on siding with the apartheid regime of israel biden will lose reelection because of his blind bias against the palestinians,1
who was that effing lunatic screaming boot em out,1
the smirk on that broads face makes me nauseous,1
president biden tell israel they dont have a right to commit genocide against the palestinians tell israel they have a right to live and exist in their own indigenous homelands where israel is a settler colonial nation,1
mtg really tried to make this about heragain,1
corporate taxes 500 b over 10 years ukraine 100 b in one year,1
mike johnsons job is to prevent a civil war not carinate a king i know this because im both a us navy veteran and a canadian immigrant trump is a con man from new york that corrupted the party for his own benefit in exchange for abortion restrictions like spoiled children everyone got what they wanted so of corse they are coming back for more,1
dirt bag president,1
surprised he didnt fall down,1
,1
what a bag of lies you have got to be kidding mesad sad example of our corrupt government,1
every single time the gop heckled and jeered biden came back with a surprisingly onhisfeet response that made the gop look as dumb as they really are,1
before you we had the strongest economy in the world and the best education system then you came along and destroyed it all,1
mr president hedge to protect faith base citizens and keep separately civil rights of citizens from lifestyle and youll get my vote,1
not one sentence has been true since he opened his mouth straight lies and deceit people wake up,1
lets go brandon,1

sounds like an american president not like the maga leader who seeks retribution and wanting so bad to be a dictator,1
georgia please vote out mtg she is a sickening poison,1
taylor greene is uncouth,1
not one republicant celebrated the news of humanitarian support for palestinians,1

gavel around 26 minutes,1
i cant remember the last time i heard a speech where literally every sentence is its own eyeroll democracy prevailed after the election was guided by media hoaxes and coordinated censorship and after this reinforcement of democracy was admitted does anyone with tepidiq still believe the fine people hoax and the insurrection hoax,1

excellent president biden,1
he sounds republican talking about some of this,1
american psychiatry association apa speaks strongly against elderly abuse,1
why was he shouting losing his hearing,1
very partisan and divisive how can we expect to improve as a nation when the president demonizes his own citizens bc they dont support his policies or agenda this country needs and deserves better and we need to unite and stop fighting against each other over politics having a different opinions is needed and creates balance and keeps our country from becoming to extreme in either direction this really makes me feel like things are going to get worse and the politicians are trying to divide us,1
the clapping makes me sick kamala is a sick woman biden has done nothing but war just ask the dead ukrainians and gazans fu,1

i love how dems were the ones who pushed for the lock downs and then enacted them and then want to take credit for people going back to work these 15 million jobs arent new jobs thats just people allowed to go to work the jobs they had before dems wanted to force everyone to stay home its such a joke and so easy to see that it pains me to think that anyone would still be dumb enough to support this garbage,1

thanx to u potus biden 1st lady jillwe all needed this man to speak hope lift us americans out of the endless tyrannical gibberish of that goon trump,1
he didnt mention anything about letting millions of illegals into america after his administration said its been secure since he took office and it wasnt a speech he was yelling the whole time plus he never addressed the inflation rate or united with both parties sounded more like a campaign stunt than anything,1
i hope they frisked mikey before they let him take that seat,1
political violence has no place in america and i see 1 republican clapping they never seem to disappoint,1
war drums old ppl trying to send young ppl to die as usual,1

im goin to joeys house and gonna take my fair share he can afford it,1
this was a great speech by president biden and a poor response by the republicans and the good senator from alabama was a bit phony and melodramatic the gop wants to use its ace card immigration but president biden had already mentioned that the maga republicans dont want good border legislation because they want to campaign on it,1
this is all we got the usa is fuked,1
watching this at 2x speed makes him sound coherant,1
i thought this was a state of the union not a political ad for joe biden this nation is so lost,1
apparently britt doesnt know that presidents dont set prices for private companies president biden did call out companies for shrinking sizes but not prices in his speech britt and the gop must like higher prices because they blocked a bill to address price gouging did you hear the gop try and pretend they didnt know that their tax break to the wealthy added a few trillion to the debt did you notice that the gop didnt stand and applaud for opposing russia for feeding school kids for expanding prek for ivf for more affordable housing for not raising the age for collecting ss not even for helping the health of our vets the gop showed who they are tonight because the only thing they stood and applauded for was support for israel not for americans,1
this is what you call presidential,1
trump 2024 fjb,1
he put republicans in there place,1
screaming and gaslighting joe will not work to unify our country lies were told tonight we dont feel safer gas prices are extreme and the cost of living is so much higher i guess joe is in denial sad btw her name is laken not lincoln who was killed by an illegal who kept being released because of democratic policies the biggest lie was that he could not do anything about the border he canceled remain in mexico and title 42 which curbed illegal immigration wake up people,1
an entire room full of sociopaths,1
i wished that mole behind the president with continuous rolling eyes couldve been pulled out of view unbelievable lack of respect he displayed how the president stating facts seemed to create more eye rolling biden should have called him out on the reason the border is not secure more,1
the oldest democrat achieves more in office than any young gop who drives us into debt and gets rich off the backs of the poor,1
great presidential couple biden jill unlike melanie trump jill biden actually does contribute to biden presidential agenda,1

go joe,1
katie britt totally useless rebuttal she brings absolutely nothing to the conversation shes a pity,1
he just kept moving so she now knows how insignificant she is,1
speech is different from actions his administration actions doesnt match his speech but once again its getting closer to elections and he wants opened borders and the worst economy ever we have to speak the truth and this is coming from a long time democrat here who grew up on this party i just wished biden would do the right things for america and not ukraine and other places when are borders are wide opened and inflation its up so is gas prices,1

bidens lies need to be called out never heard so many in a sotus what a decrepit old fool the performing seals aka radical libs hanging on to every lie and plagiarized line,1
amazing to see a hopeful empowering optimistic freedom filled future literally all that trump talks about is what we cant do who cant do it and why he is a pathetic shoepeddling broke fraud he only represents hate and spews nonsense to take advantage of the ignorant trump supporters need to wake up youre in a cult kiddos,1

lol he should be in handcuffs but he gets a pass because hes too old right,1
watching not at all impressed with mike johnson he has failed and not leading at all he is not working for the people discussed,1
bidens state of the union address forget what you are experiencing the economy is doing great forget that everything costs more and your us dollar is worth less today than it was when trump was president bidenomics is the greatest achievement in us history forget that i could all but end the fentanyl crisis in the usa in a single day by closing the border with an executive order i dont want to do that because democrats need to import democrat voters so my fentanyl plan is the same democrat plan for everything toss us tax dollars at it i ended the pandemic and only i could have done it forget that the vaccine was created under trump and because of that the lock downs were able to be lifted and people could go back to work im taking full credit for all those people going back to work in fact im counting those jobs they went back to a jobs that i created folks if you reelect me i will continue to raise the national debt buy votes with us tax dollars weaken the usa do nothing while wwiii draws closer because of weak us leadership and i will lower the value of the us dollar so much it will no longer be the worlds reserve currency,1
this was so good i also kicked some zombie cult maggots in chat lol,1
nice hat marjorie what a total loser,1
what is britt talking about,1

pray for our leadership,1
the elephant in the room aka 2 face johnson,1
great speech so proud a man of good character lets vote,1
51000 views less than 10 of msnbc channel subscribers even watched let alone the other 330000000 million people in the us tucker carlson gets 10x more views an any post on x than the president of the us gets for a state of the union address unbelievable,1
msnbc you lost me from your broadcast with the fake speaking alabama senator actress got to out of touch he has move past more knowledge than she will ever know democracy will prevail,1
is this a snl skit,1
i cant wait till trumps revenge,1
kavanaughs face was like a little boy that broke a lamp,1
trump 2024,1
there is no one more capable or qualified to be president than joe biden no one,1
americans have forgotten how we started this democracy they came here to leave repression famineand war most of us have never experienced what will you do when putin is bombing at the door,1
biden still has it and his plan will benefit all americans bidenharris 2024 period end of story,1
joe2024,1
powerful speech by old joe as little maga wimp johnson sat there like a brown stain on trumps diaper btw the after rebuttal shes a maga evangelical cult airhead,1
dont trust the republicans,1
im so proud of mike johnson for remaining in his seat and not stand like the other puppets shout out to mtg,1
bidens statement to the supreme court to watch out for women voters was a harbinger of doom for the rightwing illicit theft of the court by religious fundamentalists expand the court and impose term limits on these unelected unaccountable unjust and selfcondemned judges and merrick while youre at it isnt it about time to indict thomas and alito for open bribery and ginny for seditious conspiracy,1
they want to put us in more control and take away our freedoms they dont want prosperity they want higher taxes inflation the gas crisis the food crisis and theres going to be other crisis you got a poverty problem in this country and they just brought 50 million more of them across the border and you dont have enough taxpayers we need to get 75 million new taxpayers instead the president created 15 million government jobs and that hurts the taxpayers we need 15 million private wealth jobs more people who pay taxes,1
joe wins this will be remembered as the night he cemented another term as president,1
lies only lies he said reality is total different,1
people im reading what youre saying omg you need to change the chanel stop being sheep look what biden has done to america and the world are you people from earth,1
well all my doubts about president bidens age being able to do an effective job as president has totally disappeared from my mind the man is a genius as well as unstoppable his memory is better than many young men and women he hardly looked at his notes wow what an amazing man his detractors should reconsider their doubts and support this president who has made americas economy stronger than ever imagine an unemployment rate less than 4 percent including his plans to do so much where healthcare education school and colleges etc etc will all be improved he deserves another 4 years to make our democracy stronger and safeguard our precious democratic way of life for all times god bless him and god bless our diverse population of compassionate caring americans,1
how did he get so dumb,1
unilateral support for the genocide,1
president joe puke hes insane,1
why dont you close the border are you wanting to get more votes from the illegal immigrant shame we the people see it we are not stupid you are the biden crime family talk about your money laundering,1
a room divided between russian agents and israel employees no one represents the american people,1
wow what a speech he and the democrats are soooooooo tough on crime cannot understand why all these videos of crime keep surfacing breaking into shops walking out of target stores with goods not paid these videos must be a putintrump scheme wow put americans first at least first behind the 10 milllion illegals,1
a room divided between russian agents and israel employees no one represents the american people,1
not even the great propagandists at msnbc can spin that state of the union address into more than what it was pure bs and trash,1
he failed to mention the deaths by the hands of illegals record credits card debt record late payments energy cost going up high interest rates and people having to spend 11 of their income on food i wonder why,1
republicans arent looking to happy president put them in the hot seat told them it is up to them send him the bill and he will sign it,1
any one else pick up on the tax issue ok the billionaires pay a lower percentage in taxes than the middle class what he said i really dont know if its true or not that said true or not doesnt really matter his solution speaks volumesmake them pay as much or more so that it is fair is it unrealistic to expect a different solution perhaps bring middle class taxes down would also be fair after that cut spending and it just seems a very plausible alternative solution i had to shut it off after that point its obvious that these politicians are very close minded with a one track mindset,1
hes done trump is 100 percent going to win biden is out of touch we already decided to put trump back in office we are good on biden,1
biden served facts tonight to the gqp they all clutched their pearls,1
i have never seen so many lies propaganda and hypocrisy in one speech delivered in true adolf hitler style in my life,1
if u like the state of the world as it sits u have your guy,1
biden will lose,1
i do wish hed yelled out to magarie traitorscream go play with your jewish space lasers and leave the running of the country to the adults in the room,1
this is not a real person biden is not capable of giving that speech,1
why is the world so divided judgment day began on may 21 2011 holy god is pouring his wrath out upon the whole earth the end of the world may be in the year 2033,1
