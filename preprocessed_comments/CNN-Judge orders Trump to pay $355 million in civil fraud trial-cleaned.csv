if he is truly guilty then he needs to pay but some of this is obviously personal with a judge known to despise trump and people trying to remove him from the campaign its ridiculous to think that its not personal and i dont like trump
this verdict violates the 8th amendment of the constitution of the united states shame on any judge that would knowingly violate their oath of office to support the constitutionthis judge should be disbarred if they do this to him they can do it to you
that 1 million supporters can give trump 500 saving is worth it
i just saw a video of that judge harassing a uoung hirl at the gym she should pull an e jean carroll
trump should declare bankruptcy after all mara logo is only worth 18 million so how can he pay
god is watching all over them doing against trump fear not mr trump there are far more angels of heaven with horses and chariots of fire with you than there are with you against you
the cnn comment section is sadly a joke cnn has given way too many people on the left false hope
trump should ask for an appeal the 454 million verdict is a punishment and not a fine but a large amount of money should be addressed by the court which is an unusual amount of money for a business practice that developers and business practices do they should also be protected by the law for a huge amount of money trump didnt borrow money for the city or change the measurements of the building trump borrowed from the bank and exaggerated the measurements of the building also by law he should ask for an appeal our justice system is corrupt ny should help trump because he helped ny when the city was bankrupt the judge should accept the appeal it is normal business practice by the law it is called unusual punishment and trump will be protected by the law the same court system that the judge rule god bless truckers and trump thank you for standing up against corrupted court justice investigate da and judge for not accepting an appeal justice for one is justice for all lets go brandon
cnn wtf so many wrongs by judge
ridiculous party attack first republican vote for me in 2024 mr trump you got my vote

the whole world can now see just how deranged democrats are nyc will become a post apocalyptical dystopia
the fascist judge also fined trump another 80 million in interest dating back from when the banks gave trump the loans
remember when nazi piglosi demanded trumps tax records and then went stone silent when she discovered that trump paid all his taxes
remember this judge ruled that trump committed fraud without a hearing fascists have taken over ny
first time in history that anyone was punished for submitting a loan application where everyone was happy
instead of making our lives better this democrat party in charge has made record prices out of control spending on wars and enriched themselves while making our lives unsafe sorry but good riddens biden and democrats yall lied
how much pain do we have to suffer to help you continue your fraudulent assaults you filled our city with migrants you cost tax payers 15 billion you took our hotels away and filled them with these people you took schools away from our kids the crime is thru the roof since they arrivedthats nothingyou then sent businesses running for the highway after 200 yrs being herenow our top 2 investors in nyc have pulled there money because of this absurd caseso i ask again how much do nyers have to pay for what youre doing bankruptcy will that do it complete collapse get the hell out of this state the people have had enoughwatch nys come november

beezelbub lord of flies substance abuse violence based city state community people that need more and more abortion have the hunger of the beezelbub kingdom of philistine
truckers have stopped delivering goods to nyc myself being one of them also mark cuban and many many other businesses are pulling out of new york because of the political persecution of trump will never do business with nyc again
worthless news corrupt news
if this isnt a clear example of attacking and attempting to deter a candidate and those near him i dont know what is all of you that cant see this are deliberately avoiding the truths before you
judge is a freak with severe tds that will be disbarred
trump will pay the money and move on with the election this fall pee your pants cnnyou pricks still have low ratings
in 1981 the new york times did an article about mar a lago being worth 2 billion so what is going on
hold on upright trump psalm 3735 i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree 36 yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be found 37 mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace
the only fraud case with no bank fraud and no victims
mar lago was worth 20 million back in 1918 and this judge say its worth 19 million today
mar lago was worth 20 million back in 1918 and this judge say its worth 19 million today
we now know what this judge looks likecheck his political donations
that judge needs to go back to tales of the crypt hes not stopping the trump train hes actually shoveling in more fuel
so trump pays back a loan thats considered a crime but when a student takes out a loan and the tax payers now have to pay it thats not a crime if trump committed fraud why arent the banks suing him
stop using the courts for political gain im sure there is many liberal investors doing the same in new york but not being punished this judge needs to be punished
this is a dirty judge soon to be disbarred
aaaaand this is exacty why we call cnn communist news
appeal appeal appeal
then biden owes 5 billion lol what a joke america is now a 3rd world country
as a uk citizen ive never had much faith in government i know both sides are pretty much the same but when i heard what is happening in the usa i had to come and check it out i cant believe how the government has weaponised the legal system to shut down its competition its beyond crazy i thought the uk was bad but you guys are descending into a banana republic really fast
the banks clearly said they were paid and would do business with trump againpeople are blinded by hate for trump
i put my house as collateral by borrowing money from my bank the bank asked me what my house wealth for i told the bank what it wealth the bank came and appraised it the house and gave the money i asked for i paid the money back with all the interest so where is my crime here can anyone or cnn tell me where my crime is
you will found everything if what you are saying are true
you are lying wheres is the victim
the judge really screwed ny city
wait i thought the victim of the fraud didnt complain and they said theyre happy to do business with trump againtrump hate is not an issue but knowing cnn
where is the victim
science fiction will become science fact escape from new york
handing the election over to republicans on a silver platter
i wouldnt buy anything made in new york
this democrat bought and paid for judge is the real fraud
i normally dont stay places long but i will try i dont know what they will do next
i really need help the police force every where is rapeing me im located in chicago illinois i may have known someone who own cells but i really need help they sits around in know my every move i dont understand how im located at the pacific garden mission please find me
crooked judge just wants trump to pay for the migrants debit cards
this fool senile judge will look cute in his orange jumpsuit seize and audit all accounts to find who bought him despicable
where are the victims they are willing to destroy new york to throw shade on one man jeez this is so stupid this is why i swiched parties the democrats have become the party of do as we say or else nazi vibesmy prediction he appeals its overturned cause 400million in damages when there are none is a red flag smart people see through the smoke and mirrors this is clearly politically motivated because he is projected to winits gonna be a land slide victory if they keep this up cause now they just look like bullies and americans cant stand a bully
looks like trump has a slam dunk appeal considering judge gay fonzi took matters into his own incompetent hands determining the value of trumps assets through his own assessments and calculations which further strengthen trumps claims that this lawsuit its findings and the penalties assessed are not only frivolous but fraudulent and motivated by nothing but malice trump needs to sue the state of new york the attorney general and gay fonzi the only evidence trump needs to introduce is the big flapping mouthed judges 18 million assessment of maralago vs forbes magazines 700 million assessment of the same property pinhead libtard judge off by 682 million after evaluating one property moron disbar the flamer
here we go again the left trying to get rid of trump because he is for the people but the left wants to control americans and brain washs the weak into following there lies
trump wont pay a fukkkin dime
id bet that judge is getting a cut
this judge needs to be arrested there were no crimes no victims period lefties get out of your little bubble and do your research if you want evidence check out kevin oleary
does anyone really think this is going to matter he just got a 4 billion dollar deal approved if we really want to save democracy we need to end democracy orangeman soo bad right now
he is stupid and does not understand that to take the appeal route will only end up costing him more money and he will lose guaranteed maybe is why the attorney has not exposed this aspect of the case holding it in abeyance for just this response from dumbo or maybe it is very clear to him that there is some type of confidential insider they he stiffed along the way otherwise it does appear to be excessive
there may have been some cases where it was in the companies best long term interest to pursue this route in a bankruptcy scenario but to force this kind of action in conjunction with others should have been investigated and exposed and the perpetrators held accountable as this fraudfraudster was the american people are so funking ignorant is absolutely amazing that this country has mananaged to out perform the rest of the world
people were hurt especially if their retirement accounts were raided and they had to rely on the government guaranty fund which would pay a substantially less amount than the union or company promised in negotiations and give backs this is criminal america at its worst no one was harmed is a croc of chit the banks made money is this arrangement and should be charged as well since they assisted in the fraud on the publicworkers
judge erdogan must be renting all his life he has no clue as to the differences of 4 different values applied to everyone house 1 real market value 2 city property assessment is much lower 18 million in florida means taxes are paid upon this tax assessment lower city assessment to prevent appeals to taxation 3 insurance higher than market evaluation to rebuild higher premiums 4 takes out a loan or 2nd mortgage for reno bank will allow up to 80 depends but their market value used is lower that the 80 drops to 6568 to get repaid in case of insolvency judge erdogan is unqualified and bias
this is the result of not providing a full accounting of just what kind of game was being played here in this scenario there were many companies that were worth more if they were dismantled and have their assets soldoff so the companies were worth more is they were soldoff in pieces especially their retirement funds set aside by law force the company into bankruptcy this goes to inside knowledge and and indepth analysis of the overall health of a company and whether they were vulnerable to this type of scam the failure to go beyond the apparent by the media is a form of malpractice
this judge is delusional
you blues are all happy about trumps prosecution but this is setting a dangerous precedent it is now ok for the government to target a citizen and ruin the persons life dont think this wont trickle down the legal system when you anger a local politician and she decides to go after you good luck you cant fight the government and she will have a precedent to fall back on
did you get your 1000 dollar prepaid credit card yet that automatically renews every 28 days you should also be getting a monthly check to cover the average cost of a 4 star hotel with room service and sales and resort taxes included about 10000 minimum if you havent received that yet call or write you congressman and two us senators to see what the delay is thousands of illegals are already getting that money in new york yours should be on its way
we have more corruption than ukraine
all truckers boycott new york city
a circus of clowns
enough of this spitting on the faces of taxpayers with letitia acting like a king and adams giving money to the illegals call for their usurping
how can i be a paid troll i can do way better more than half of these bot accounts
truckers boycotting new york pay it
its so obvious they are doing whatever it takes to make trump get away from running for president he will be president if trump never ran for office he would have never been attacked like this
this judge is a clown just like our sitting president traitor joe
this is just ridiculous a systematic plan to try and destroy trump and really anyone associated with the republican party im not a deep trump supporter but anyone who thinks this isnt politically motivated needs a shitload of help
things will get worse for the people of new york
if biden is unfit to stand trial hes unfit to run the country
in dictatorships countries the justice is used to destroy opponents of the regime russia venezuela nicaragua and now new york state
jealous commie judge who works for the corrupt government
so when trump takes out a loan then pays it back with interest its a crime but when you take out a student loan and dont pay it back then biden forgives the loan steals money from the taxpayers to pay it back its not a crime
the judge is a moron who should be disbarred over his stupidity
the judge committed appraisal fraud he is not qualified to appraise real property or even a ham sandwich this judge is relying upon his immunity from prosecution to keep trump from going after him personally however this judge will be found to be the party to have committed fraud upon appeal i say this with a great deal of experience in this type of matter based upon 36 years of experience as a real estate appraiser the first thing that should be looked at is how did this judge arrive his values for trumps properties i am willing to be anyone that the three approaches to value income cost market were not completed furthermore i will also bet that a as of date of valuation was never assigned for cnn viewers that means the date the court assigned the value was it 2000 2022 or what it must be specific dates as in 01012022 or its all worthless which it is anyway as the judge has zero real estate education see his wiki page you will also discover he is an old failure of a musician that fell back on the law for a living
theyre trying to frame trump as a symbol of corrupt capitalism to the libtard teachers student govt workers welfare voter base yet their saying he defrauded a bank the actual culprit when it comes to fraud overexuberant capitalist corruption ironic aint it
lock him up lock him up
as an observer of this matter to establish fraud 1 a representation of fact 2 its falsity 3 its materiality 4 the representers knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth 5 the representers intent that it should be acted upon by the person in the manner reasonably contemplated 6 the injured partys ignorance of its falsity 7 the injured partys reliance on its truth 8 the injured partys right to rely thereon and 9 the injured partys consequent and proximate injury no injured party exists in this matter there can be no verdict of fraud as case law makes clear shame on this judge he failed to uphold the law will absolutely be overturned in appeals
how dare u being outsider and run for president and win and half the assholes of the country think hes a bad person for that reason you people are sheep anything in media government tells you you listen hook line sinker
even the bank testified that they did their own stress testit was the banks decision at the end of the day and they were paid back this case is a joke there were no victims and they made money from his loans and investments the bank even said its normal for for abussiness moguls to do this the only claim is that the judge said the loaners could have charged a higher interest if they had known wtf bro its the banks and insurance companies responsibility to check the valuation claims and the fine ok if they want to fine him ok go buy this amount wtf a similar case just months ago was only fined 1m this case doesnt even have victims the judges jurisdiction is to protect those who cannot protect themselves these are banks not helpless civilians and the bank is defending him so now if a judge hates u he can just charge u as much as they want
why is the only time in history this bs law got used it was used on the leading presidential candidate governor hokem just said it wont be used again on other realtors that do the exact same thing how naive do you have to be to believe this isnt fascist hate trancends law germans know it
the attack on trumpthe mattrix attack on trump crazy
why are peoplecheering the targeting of a us citizen just because u hate his guts doesnt mean you end our democracy by establishing a progressive liberal oligarchy that can imprison anyone they want any time they want thats some putin stuff u ket antifa run wild like the iranian republican gaurds or nazi brown ahirts while arresting hard working jan 6 defenders and send to prison if u think all this is funny that republicans r being targeted u realy wont in 30 yrs when this one oarty govt come for you even whenu thought they were on your sidethey arent trust me they just arent
the judge shoukd be in prison and investors who did everythign trump did will bail on ny because everytime they need money for immigrants they will parade a billionare up infront of the judge and hanmer him for 500 million people who have money shoukd abandon ny and do it fast
the judge lied about the value of his mar largo property by artificially lowering the value to get a conviction should he also be held accountable by the law what about the banks who made profits off the loans should they be held liable as well you need to think deeper beyond get trump the fact there was no one hurt here means either the tyrannical government can now go after everyone who received loans or its simply selective prosecution this isnt russia yet although the dems like to try to imprison and bankrupt political opponents
congrats new york now no one will invest in the city because of it nice going lib tards lmfao
democrats will regret doing this businesses are watching this is beyond politics you muppets
fake charges and cnn listners are brain dead everything cnn says is all lies and yet lets continue to watch this failed network
this may be why convicted sexual abuser donald trump moved to florida his crimes would be exposed in ny and he would be limited in ways we are seeing moved to florida to continue his criminal enterprise unabated under a goomba governor who fires prosecutors that do their job to uphold the law trump motto appears to be it aint a crime if you dont get caught
the 355 million order will be reversed on appeal the funds go to ny state general fund no damage or funds to banks or consumers trump still works with these banks note in a real estate you dont know the true property value until you sell a property
cartoon news network
that judge can barely hold a straight face they threatenhe says okill do it
if anyone on here actually watched the trial trump was brought up on charges for allegedly defrauding banks and insurance companiesthe alleged victims testified that they would welcome trumps business and that he paid everyone backthis verdict is a joke keep destroying new york until we all have to leave i guess losing close to a million people over the last few years isnt enough
looks like democrats want money for themselves
show me the man and ill show you the crime
im wondering what happens if trump just pays the 355 million just pay it then what else what are you clowns gonna say youre hoping he cant pay it so if he pays it then what
so a single judge in new york rules on the property values in florida even though they are clearly 3 times the size of neighboring properties they should somehow be of the same value this is just another one of many partisan attempts to discredit trump when its clear that the democrats and its lackey news organizations like cnn lack any credibility enjoy your inevitable bankruptcy cnn you worked really hard to be this incompetent
if cruella devil had a brother it would be this judge seriously he looks like a evil disney character
a lot of theater and it is just a waste of time to trump its like a fly at a picnic irritating but doesnt cancel the picnic the entire case will get tossed by the scotus and anyone with an honest and critical brain can predict
everyone of you on here better have a back up plan if trump wins you people will loose your minds you wont be able to handle it if trump looses you wont see much from maga acting like that
like if he is not to appeal
insane doj politically corrupt
trump is now a felon as well as an insurrectionist and hes still in the running to be president one thing the constitution doesnt provide for i read that the reason was the founding fathers believed the voters would make good choices not electing a criminal what a myopic view that turned out to be unless trump is elected and dismantles the constitution the way hitler did in germany to take power i think the constitutions ready for another amendment a convicted felon as a us president does the office have any credibility left
so the penalty for claiming that you are more rich than you are is 355 million dollars
most people in business already know that the extremely wealthy have an unfair advantage ie if you are extremely wealthy more than trump apparently you can save 168 million dollars on interest payments most businesses dont have a huge profit margin maybe 20 percent is a good point for most this trail points out that the common person would have to pay an additional 168 million maybe more if you have less money the trump in interest payments effectively eating away at the profit margin so the extremely rich saves 168 million and can lower the cost of their widgets or use capitol in other ways to be more competitive while not affecting the profit margin this means the extremely rich will most likely win in a competitive business every time making the richest richer and keep the less rich in their place now government judge is stepping in to help the billion dollar finance industry keep this borderline criminal process going this should be the focus and the reason for outcry stop focusing on trump and see how the rich get rich while the rich are left with scraps
new york businessmen beware you may be next
how about the fraud on the white house page under current president saying they are putting money back in americans hands is that not fraud then to lol wtf

this is all the pot calling the kettle black by all of america and its so sad to see our only hope for middle class success trying to be destroyed like this for what communism socialism so we can all be poor or what
wow they just through everything at this guy this is over falsely applying for bank loans holy crap the reality is any single one of us can be crushed at any time in our life and thats a cold reality you know is true really sad to see this stuff
all i have to say is im a poor low level contractor and its cost me nothing to get money owed to me each and every time but i also do what i say i am going to do per contract so thats all
trump claims to be such a great business man but he started a go fund me site trump is nothing more than a scam artist he ripped off veterans with his trump university worthless degree that is nonaccredited and he ripped off millions of others with his trump foundation that he used as his personal piggy bank both trump university and the trump foundation were forced to be shutdown because of the fraud that was going on
18 years not paying taxes i guess you reap what you sew it says in the bible karma is real if you have to step over people to get rich the easier it come the easier it go

im glad the judge went after trump and im glad he took him down i think he didnt charge him enough trump is a monster they should have kicked him out of the usa him and his family and they should never be allowed back in donald trump and all them crooked sons i bet if he dug deep enough and find something on the daughter the soninlaw and the wife but im sure hes got everything in that little sons name the next future trump crook the ugliness that came out of his mouth about russia he needs russias money russia has money of his in the banks of russia as does china or its in the a swiss account but he has money all crooks that are hiding money from the us government have accounts overseas bank accounts and thats another thing a government needs to go after all damn accounts that theyre stealing money and having it in other countries pretending they live there people are doing it and they need to go after them im sure theres more money of trumps there dig dig dig keep this man off the ballots we dont need this crook its bad enough that somebodys gonna put another crook in there at least we got one down
as far as willis she shouldnt be thrown off the case this woman had the courage to take this man down along with the judge and this is just applaud to stop her and the judge finished partially the job cause he still has a little bit work ahead of him should trumps tries to appeal hopefully hell be too broke to do so him and his two crooked sons as far as willis its nobodys business who shes sleeping with she wasnt stealing anybodys money every smart woman watches out with men men have swords in their mouth oh i took you here i paid for this i brought you that you know like now they own you she is a strong black woman being taken down humiliated just like a general guy he got prostate cancer thats nobodys business thats personal thats about his penis why does he got a broadcast it to everybody my brothers ashamed to tell the family that he has a problem with his nose imagine down there its just humiliating that they did that to her and they did that to him prostrate cancer serious its nobodys business i think the last thing that man was thinking about was broadcasting it he wants to get well theres a til its a new cancer cure for skin cancer theyre saying it might work on other cancers i hope he gets to see this as far as willis like i said its nobodys business nobody likes to people to know who theyre beding with thats nobodys business it rings talk and gossip especially around the job place it looks to me like theyre attacking our black people in high positions thats what im saying like theyre doing a domino drop going after every black person in a high position in congress the white house the court buildings they go on after all of them because these people had the courage to go after this crook and his family thank god the judge is white im surprised youre not going after him but im glad he had the courage to stand up and finish the job now we have to hope that they take them down and get them out of a country three years is not enough they shouldve charged him more money because like people are saying he was stealing that money from everybody not only the government
maybe investigate the investigators what a democratic shame
its not up to trump to value his propertysits up to the bank appraiser no one gets to pick the value of their properties
instead of the mexicans paying for that huge wall maybe they can pay his huge legal bills
exactly who will receive any of these fines or will it be paid to some city or states treasury who exactly were defrauded who lost money in direct relation to his overvaluations
bwahaha this sham dies in appellate court cant wait to see him take office after sweeping this election
the market price of an asset or service is determined by the forces of supply and demand not an inexperienced judge
hilarious this is a murder conviction without a murder this goes away in appellate court enjoy your 15 minutes of victory then buckle up for four years of the most amazing presidency youve ever seen btw 354 million to trump is the equivalent to 15000 for those of you that have saved 500000 in your lifetime chump change that will die in the appeal anyway
ok lets treat everyone in ny the same as trump then have trump case as the baseline anything more they get the same treatment fairs fair
ny so broke they have to extort money
ny so broke they have to extort money
complete bogus will get retrial and not guilty all you fools that hate banks decide your wealth for loans not the person applying for one trust me go to the bank for a million dollar loan and see what reds are needed to get it yes this trail if you call it that is just that simple hey hows brandon treating ya along with all the nyc demons giving your money to illegal intruders now theyre getting prepaid amex cards at 100000 the cost for nyc taxpayers 51 million how ya feeling as our less fortunate get ignored challenge me on any of brandon policies and ill crush you bring it on but im sure it will be all scared quiet crickets
typical vengeance politics
when is he going to be doing time for all his crimes get with it will ya stop playing game with the people
fraud is cheating and lying and thats the point to all of this trump has the mindset that cheating wherever you can is okay its not your either honest business man or your not theres no degrees or honesty
so who gets the 355 million
god bless donald trump and god bless america
and the same people that are complaining about trump probably voted him for president oh the irony
the real fireworks are yet to come ivankajared having 25b will certainly be expected to return trumps conditional pardon of jareds father charles
prophet diana larkin a watchmans journal february 17 2024 the hanging judge has just hung himself the bait was just too juicy and the hanging judge just couldnt resist ithe bit in his deluded drunk with power mind he thinks hes delivered a deathblow to your rightful leader those partnered with darkness are all patting themselves on the back at this deathblow they think theyve delivered my army of light do not be in anxiety over this apparent victory for the darkness it will be shortlived because there is a higher judge above this lawless judge and that is your god most high im inviting you to see with my eyes into the future and you will realize the hanging judge has just hung himself crowing with victory will turn to eating crow when the corruption and bribery behind this judgment are exposed dont think of bad judgments like this as defeat think of them as exposures on steroids as people and plots are exposed exposed exposed hold steady army of light and continue to call forth the exposures and call in the judgments of the unjust wait and seethe hanging judge has just hung himself
strange tucker interview comes out now this the propag war has been lost
this judge is a too little too late hero for folks on a ship doomed to sink trump 2024
as a european citycens i see a lot of difference in trump now and 8 years ago trump is more agressieve and a man full of hate you cant choose a man full of hate to rule a big country he is starting to look like putin he even like putin even he is old biden is verry stabel and trustworthy it is a no brainer to chose between trump and biden but it would be a good thing somme new and younger stabel politicians would stand up to becomme a respectfull president candidate one who respect every life and famelie no matter youre rich or poor
what an idiot judgehe needs disbarred like yesterdaygo get your crayons judge and go back to 1st grade this time around listen to the teacher
sec just cleared 10 billion dollar truth social media deal he will own over 5 billion of it 330 million he can wipe his a with it love it try again vampire marxist judge
no no one will do reality in new york fools lol tinfoil hat fools
engoronmaralago valued at eighteen million dollars florida real estate associationmaralago listed as a national historic landmark over 20 acres of prime ocean front real estate in the miami beach area consisting of 123 rooms 63000 square feet valued at one billion dollars no victim a ridiculous judgement all of these ridiculous criminal and civil indictments will eventually reach the supreme which will toss them like a hot potato anyone with a iq over 70 can see this is nothing other than political persecution of a leading opposition candidate and it is exactly what takes place in fascist marxist third world countries do you honestly think any of this would be taking place if trump were not on the ballot wise up
awesome this is one of those sites that censorsdeletes comments before they even post just because they tell an unfavorable fact about potato or dems i see
except nobody was defrauded of anything and all wirnesses from banks were on trunps side political trash ny trying to make trump pay for all the illegals ny caused with their votes all they are going on is the judges appraisal of maralago which is absurd at 18 million there is an open lot with a worse view for sale for 200 million this will be thrown out by the higher courts where liberal mental illnesses havent run wild the ignorant news caster claimed trump has to pay it back there is nothing to pay back nobody lost a dime and he didnt inflate the value of his property the judge just undervalued it
i love how both the disgusting normal judge and the disgusting normal trump use psycheist slurs to insult each other when in reality both are evil normaltrash
trump may want nato to pay his bills but looks like hes the one getting the bill this time
soon he will tell his maga fans to pay his bills
why are the american courts harassing the former president are they not becoming retrogressive to the progress of democracy
its ok he doesnt have to do business in new york for 3 years because hes going to be running the country from the white house trump2024
let me get this right this is for providing a better then the truth of the financial situation of the companys for which he was one of the directors there is no issue of not paying back loans but the better commercial arrangements of these loans the more favourable terms are the fraudulent gains that is the subject of the fraud
corruption is the game this judge plays there all corrupt
these people hate trump more than love america give them an inch they take a foot next up is stormy daniels bs
jsmes is a creepy lady corrupt by soros
that judge is creepy
sorry trump this looks like a tough one to get out of shouldnt have messed with biden
guess this is the way they distract from the fact theyve admitted biden is both a criminal and senile
circling the drain
how i would love it if they had read the paper before reporting so stupid
the new york city attorney general putin just proved that democratic party criminal dictatorship justice system is exactly the same as that of russias putin government 039
nice one
trump is worth 26 billiondo the math dodo democratswho does he write the check out tojoe biden
the worthless tammany hall judge shall rue the day
i dont think ya have to have proof i know in county court you are allowed 1 free knock to remove a judge
everyone crying justice finallyits a nothing burger
you could tell that crooked donny got hurt by the ruling
pay back to who
the orange man has taken losing to a whole new level
new york businesses are welcome in florida
so any business who has fudged on revenues or deductions can be fined 300 million plus in new york and barred from doing business this data going back decades a pox in nyc and new york state this should doom businesses from doing any business in nycnew york state all businesses in ny fear and all current and ex company officers that have done business in nycny fear fear and get out now
this whole video is we havent read it yet so just fucking wait until youve read it
no one was monitarily hurt by trump why 355 million
new york courts are unfair and businesses need to leave asap
weaponized court system in new york is dangerous
new york big businesses come to florida we will treat you fairly
new your businesses come to florida as we have fair judges
this sets a ver bad precedent for new york businesses
new york is scamming big businesses trumps first and who is next any conservative business
so a state government org filed a civil fraud case it wasnt on behalf of any of the supposed victims the onus was on the supposed victims to verify whether or not trumps claim of property value was valid they acknowledged this both verbally and legally and then accepted the terms of the loans anyways the loan was paid back in full leaving the supposed victims of fraud benefited by the business transaction of the loan so the state government without being able to even get the victims to claim such or demonstrate any harm done to them have somehow found not only trump but 2 of his sons just guilty as well then just randomly claim trump needs to fess up 355000000 to again theres no victims is the state just straight up robbing trump are they demanding the money be paid to them and im not supposed to believe trump when he says the deep state is conspiring against him
d trump is business guynot politician at all america wc up please d trump is not feeting for president of america pride and corruption of d trump going together
trump will not pay a cent because its all a tool of the left that hate him so much because of the good he did in 4 years that they couldnt do in decades
this trial looks and feels like a scam
not one bank or insurance company lost any money so how can a judge come up with 355 million this is a prejudice judge and is the democratic party getting this money if not who
oh jeez like its a surprise of how this case was going to go definitely be overturned especially since there was no victim no complaints lol
this prejudiced judge needs to be fired immediately
this should be titled rnc needs to step up fundraising to pay for trumps legal bills
lol the potato joes sec just gave the go ahead for trump medias merger with dwac truth social trump could get a stake worth 4 billion lol
note of the day as with lysychansk mariupol bakhmut and maryinka now avdiivka too has fallen to the russians in their mission to drive out the agents of usnato expansionism
do you know what this fraud is it is the government saying he defrauded the bank by saying his properties were valued too high and using them as collateral to get other loans now let me ask you something do you go tell the bank what your property is worth when youre using it as collateral for a loan or does the bank assess that value i dont think cnn understand the implications of this the bank itself says there was no fraud the bank itself says the loans were repaid with interest and they profited from the deal this would be like you doing a cash out refinance on your own home to use for an investment opportunity and then getting sued for fraud because when you took out the loan the bank appraised your property too high this is psycho
ivanka needs to pay for her own participation in this fraud trial as well because she has known all along what was going on even the judge has said that she couldnt remember things that she was asked by the prosecutor and when she was asked about things by her own attorney she was able to remember a lot about what was going on little mis princess is not so innocent as she pretends to be
just thinking jfks rfks and teddys father joseph kennedy was a bootlegger around the same time as was al capone
its funny that someone that calls himself a billionaire asking his supporters to pay his legal bills
biden is short of money to give to israel and ukraine so he plans to use trumps money to pay for it
mr wonderful of sharktank said what trump did is common practice in real estate yeah wow keep it up cnn keep solidating trumps voter base all the jobs this guy created means nothing to these people
trump going to siphon on the rnc campaign funds whereas no other candidates will have any funds to campaign on
will that go to ukraine
lmao yo liberal commies your celebration will be short lived the commie left and fake news know this will be overthrown on appeal lmao
this might cause him to stop eating judge do you want that on your conscience
you know biden will just give it to ukraine like a common blankface
maybe he can get his conservative evangelical right wing notice i didnt say christian friends to take pass the collection plate during their maga gatherings to raise money to at least make an installment payment just saying
lets gooo pay up donny
no jury involved
what exactly is he supposedly guilty of the answer isnothing at all if those he did business with testified to a fair and beneficial transaction then all is fair
the judge is affiliated with the dnc what do you guys expect this is just a bs verdict
engoron is a fool
its weird rules for trump to deflect from joes corruptionlook into joeoh his age forgives himgeeze people in america have to be so stupid and blind and short sited and misinformed not to see things as a problem that will eventually bite them life under biden has been so tough is this what we call build back better right from january 2021joe bidens inauguration world changedare americans really that stupid not to notice that under trumpwhile the media was all hate upon himthe economy soared until china brought the virus to stop american success but under biden americans pockets are sufferingthe country is actually being destroyed sometimes i actually think these pro biden comments are really bots or maybe paid illegals who came across the borderyou knowthe people that will count your votes and come out as the crowd that supports joe for all cameras to seeor are botswhich makes the lives of those behind this really emptyreal people cant be that stupid
the judge looks like the cryptkeeper
its ironic that nato demands payment of their bills yet fails to fulfill their financial obligations this highlights a contradiction in their stance as they expect others to adhere to financial responsibilities that they themselves neglect
the court system is now the greatest danger to democracy
should americans vote for someone that behavior this way
what everyone is failing to see is that trump is getting a good hard look at the underbelly of our so called justice system it is time to clean up the doj fbi and the black robed criminals in our court systems trump 2024 the wrath of the don time to clean house
meanwhile our boy hunter briben sells _paintings_ 3x to 5x more than a picasso we see you lets go briben
the entire world has been astounded to watch the usa tear itself apart trying to justify having trump as a potential president he is a totally crooked his entire fortune has been made out of laundering illicit russian money he has lived in putins pocket for 40 years one useful idiot was all it took to turn america upside down
the 354 million was a play to slow down the campaign was he guilty most likely but the 354 million is crazy kinda bullshit
completely corrupt prosecution
everybody knows what is going to happen to that judge wait and see
354 million is way too much of penalty i think he will have to pay but not that much thats crazy figures
trump knew he was committing fraudulent activities liar
hate is cancerous love the key to shalompeace
communist tactics being employed laughable laughable laughable last time watching this channel wish you all the best

trump is childish this is a graying child with a childish complex of hysterics in a childrens supermarket when his parents refused to buy him a toy he liked god protect america from such children
is there precedent the banks agreed with his appraisal and have been fully reimbursed miscarriage of justice
someone on youtube tried to tell me that appeals courts dont exist anymore then i find out just another lying democrat go figure
this is good but not good enough trump has not bin president for 3 years and 3 months and he is still in control of the republikkklan party it will be the same with his companies and the children are free in 3 years is this really justice
misuse of power on the part of the judge this will backfire in the near futurejust watch
this ruling against a political opponent would be embarrassing in the haiti and the democratic republic of congo what a stupid country
you are glad that trump was convicted but you dont think at all that now a precedent has been created you are buying a house or refinancing the bank made an appraisal gave you a loan but the local politician wants to punish you now it will be very easy
cant wait till fannys held liable for her business dealings

wish you stop calling trump a business man it sullies that term he is a confidence man
trump be nimble trump be quick trump will grift with a pathetic shift
i bet trump was the kid who had chocolate smeared on his face and hands would swear to his mom he did not eat the chocolate cake and there is no there there
453 oh well if trump and team say there was no fraud well then i guess that must be true
get ready for new juges in 10 months
trump is a punk and a con artist hes been scamming people his whole life its about time for him to be held accountable maga can try to bail him out if they want to
truth is exstreamly dangerous to democrat democracy see thats why i live in a constitutional republic i dont have to worry about democrat communist democracy trying to rule over my life i am an independent sovern not a democat slave
so if their truly was fraud just why didnt any just so much as 1 single person that trump frauded supposably press thus charges nope not a one made such alligation the prosicuter made up the entire case out of thin air this is a simple case that will be reversed by the supreme court ill bet you 1million dollars the biden crime family is pissed at puttin for blowing up over 21 bioweapons lab within the ukraine which hunter was part owner at the least of 1 of those bio weapons labs or so it says inside the hunter biden laptop and what about biden taking showers with his daughter while she was between the ages of 9 and 11 yrs old accourding to her lost diary how about those 70 government officals busted and raded for taking bribes from contracters to maintain etc housing why havent you spoken a word about these facts oh yell my bad i keep forgetting thats not your agenda your agenda is to ruin good while placing evil people high upon pedistools im not worried though for i know your days are numbered and the truth though not from you will be placed all out in the open for everyone to see and hear so very soon very soon
they do everything to stop him and want to hit him in the wallet can you imagine demented biden and crazy harris back stand up america and vote for trump
let this send a message to kennedy haley or any other political opponent
the world is getting sick of your hate for trump we need a world power to do better for us you are failing the president has dementia and is making harmful decisions its time for a change world what can we do
the trump prosecutors sold their souls for soros money disgrace to d party
a credible judge who needs a law clerk to sit with him to change his depends the washington media are orgasmic coming all over themselves trump haters are screaming in what can best described as the only carnal satisfaction they have ever had so going forward all democrat business need to be audited any of them who sold their businesses above assessed values need to be tried in court like trump all private homes need to be audited and recorded anyone selling their home at market value needs to be tried in court
fox news along with the republican party is now the trump family business if you want to upset a democrat tell them a lie if you want to upset a republican tell them the truth
judge engron aka eric charles banegas fannie willis aka dianna bailey steve aka sex trafficking slob mother are you guys still winning colluded together so they could collect from my trust fund slobs te ll them gow you lied on my death certificare so you could keep collecting on my trust fund
i wonder if fake judge will accept trumps fake maga money
this judge is a joke mp im laughing at you
let me get this straight new york and the banks were very incompetent for decades letting trump over inflate the value of his property i guess that would also mean he was paying to much in property taxes until he decided to run for president again i also question why no other developer has been charged seems like trump would not be the only company doing this trying to inflate so they can get bigger loans
nato pay your bills trump
thank you cnn for assisting in ruining this country by making the people who watch you stupid
oh this is terrible i feel just awful for the trumps what are they going to do now actual work watch ill bet the price of trump paraphenalia is gonna drop like a stone now should be able to pick up that red hat for 50 cents at garage sales soon
so tell me again why is he asking for immunity if he hasnt committed any crimes
we got this twice that in the campaign fund more coming in ppl we are americans we got this your talking millions were saving billions dont be stupid we got thislmao
most countries their court is very corrupt
its a smear job and cnn are still journalist wannabes
trump payment plan i know a guyjared
should have been 364 billion
america and their free and fair election this is a clear politicial witchhunt
they are not going to get a dime from mr trump it is time to serve an eviction notice on the white house
again trump gets special treatment when comparing to the madoff case
so alina habba at this stage has secured close to half a billion dollars in penalties for her client between this and the defamation case shes possibly the worst lawyer in world history
pay drump freaking pay i am rolling over with laughter
why why why do some of these people fight against our constitution rule of law so hard trying to overthrow our government
no jury with a liberal judge yeah you can bet the judges decisions were not political banana republic is coming at you live
but biden and his dope addict son did questionable business with russia with while he was in the white house and hides a computer with all kinds of evidence but ever one look aside they all worried that trump is gonna show all there corrupt politicians
trump 2024 we the people are behind trump 100
this is the only way they can try to take their political opponent out because hes so far ahead what a corrupt judge typical demorats
hope the donors are wise to him or else their contributions will go to pay off this but hell claim bankruptcy will the taxpayers carry his debt then or does that not go away
and trumps poll numbers will keep going up you dishonest idiots
lets hear what trump has to say cant wait actually looking forward to it
judge pls disqualified him from the ballot
letitia should sue him for defamation he keeps call her corupt without evidencejust keep hammering the moron
the judge in new york gave trump a break i fill he should been banned for life and they should have pay the people of new york more money cause it not enough and dont make up for what trump stove from the american people in new york
so this was a new york state case do any other states have similar cases that they can bring
no death penalty is the tradeoff keep the business but you gotta pay 355m that protects this ruling from the appeal
this guy is a con like his father being rich he can buy his freedom unlike averagfolks will be in jail for years if americans vote for this guy it will be sad time to say the least
perspective from an independent all this has done is galvanize his supporters youve now got people that are twice as passionate about getting him reelected ive asked some of my left leaning independent friends how these court cases have resonated with them the consensus is they are inclined to vote third party or not at all i heard several people say the justice system was being used as a weapon or political instrument
why is everyone crying up here trump said hes a billionaire he should have plenty of money to cover this right
america is under sanctions wake the fuck up food is cheaper in russia gas is cheaper in russia rent is cheaper in russia
its great to see that nasty floating turd finally get flushed

i had a drunk guy tell me he would buy my house for 2 millionso i put my house on the market for 2 millionthat meansaccording to this judgei am legally allowed to use my house for 2 million in collaterali love this math
in 2024 donald trumpf and ted cruz will be running as the savanah bananas from havana
the political elites are trying to make an example out of trump to instill fear into any everyday american who might try to stand up against their power their goal is to prevent any and all people who would attempt to reform the status quo of political corruption from even thinking about taking the risks in this respect theyve been wildly successful no one in their right mind would attempt to stand against these monsters it requires incredible courage absolute madness or perhaps a bit of both
the people of the state of ny are the victims
money can buy time out of jail if another country helps him be president again he canwill pardon himself he has no shame
no victimsshe said she was gona get trump to get elected this is not good who are they going to get next justice is blindnot
new york became a legal banana republic

i am definitely voting for the socalled felon donald j trump only america 1st agendais better than obuma azzkisser biden
this proves never borrow more than you can safely lift and if you must only borrow from those you trust the feds ___ makes sense
banana republic of usa
now go after joe biden for his china money
trump is such a hypocrite he has to post the full amount in escrow according to the judge and he has to pay interest that amount through his appeal this judgment will stand its very clear and lays it all out trump is a crook
these anchors are so superficial
no one should be allowed the be a president of the usa for a crime as little as petty theft or even a misdemeanor but legislation only wants to use that law on the little people blacks
poor guy he did it to himself but the stable genius almost pulled it off chances are had he conceded in 2020 and called it a stint he wouldnt be in such hot water now
call it a blessing and head to texas president trump
call it a blessing and head to texas president trump

john 31621 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he who believes in him is not condemned but he who does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that the light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light lest his deeds should be exposed but he who does the truth comes to the light that his deeds may be clearly seen that they have been done in god
i think i can safely speak for us allbahahahahahaha he fucked around and found out

the judge is low iq
trump properties need to be sold off he purchased properties golf courses mar a largo etc with money he obtained illegally did we learn anything from sam bankman fried ftx etcall the firms that passed the loans should be hit with fines as well they signed off on fraudulent documents to allow trump to use real estate as a ponzi scam
well when you have the full force of the unelected deep state that runs the dem uniparty rinos the current administration our government agencies most of our courts law offices corporations special interest groups and allow other countries our enemies nato who un ruin uh run our states and our nation what do you expect history and proven over and over and the maga crowd knows the real goal of socialism is the elites total control of their citizens forced tyranny
facts not the dems or uniparty rinos truths in 2026 china joe will be held by all families affected by the illegal trespassers who committed crimes including accessory to murder those who od on fentanyl the unaccompanied illegal trespassing minors used in child trafficking who are the victims by being dropped off to unknown persons in the middle of the night at random airport baggage claim areas and all the terrorist cells from all our enemy countries including china that will soon be acting out now that presidents no longer have more immunity us presidents are no longer protected for their decisions while in office reelect a dem or uniparty rino and they will only double down it will be sf and oakland nation wide
everything about trump is fake fake businessman fake president fake hair fake tan and fake bank accounts and property valuations

lock him up
let biden pay for it he steals billions from america
sorry trump wins again penalties are too soft money award too low business licenses are only 3 years he can still survive in ny we were expecting a much harsher judgement but the judge was way too nice althought highly professional now we are back to the beginning mr bragg give us justice please

this judge is the criminal no one harmed no one testifying for the prosecution and liberal da and judge in cahoots awful criminal theft by the judicial system legalizes governmental theft by the system pure vindictive judgement towards the whole family this is in its proof wicked theft wonder how much the democratic party pays the judge and da for the payoff kinda like fanis cash flow and no documented proof of where it came from most likely the same place with access to large cash flows chinese to dems or from criminals seeking no law enforcements or law enforcement
biden wants a job with trump
where is the justice where is the victim its called the department of justice should change the name to dnc banks made millions of dollars in interest payments from trump maybe trump is the victim banks need to repay trump millions
trump will never pay he never does
cnn news is a real crap news
hes always trying to make it seem like the entire country is on trial the country is suffering bcoz hes being held accountable for his own legal troubles a con man will always try to lay blame on someone else continue to try to cast blame on someone else for his wrong doings it wasnt the judge or the ag who inflated the worth size of his business his maga cult is going to go bankrupt trying to financially support a con man bernie madoff comned an awful lot of money from a lot of ppl is being held accountable for his betrayal of the ppl he conned out of millions of dollars so drumpy drump is no different one con man is to another they all must not be allowed to run scams on the american ppl without retribution
and millions want him to be president sheesh the gop has dug itself into such a deep hole over the last 78 years and they just keep digging my former party is unsavable at this point and it will take at least a generation to overcome quite possibly two generations
roll the begathon campaign we need actual money
joe biden is the fraud
trump is getting violated for no reason it pisses me off
old corrupted hater from united states
the country moved to an endangered situation where local prosecutors are the attack dogs of the democratic party all the prosecutors are elected democrats this is like putins russia when opponents are jailed because of tax evasion then disappear
he didnt rob a bank with a gun he robbed the banks with a pen and fraudulent intent to gain an advantage over the standards and norms of business ethicspractices that keeps everyone on a level playing field
this judge is a horribly hateful and spiteful person when you get loans professional assessors come out to evaluate your assets the value at the time of the loan what did trump do wrong
mexico will be paying this judgement you just wait
the biggest criminal is sitting in the white house america is a banana republican its no wonder the democrats havent gone for the whole republican party what makes it worse is people through their political hate they have accepted the corruption of the fbi and other law enforcement agencies trouble is when they come for you dont cry about it banana republic
we are now officially a 3rd world nation
no surprise there genuine political prosecution and election interference the american government has not been legitimate since the cia killed kennedy
political interference unfair election interference by the democrats

anyone wanna make a fun bet we will both mark a date in our calanders like 9 months from now we will then return to this comment thread and one of us will say i told you so if i am the one who gets to say i told you so then you have to admit youve been lied to for the last 8 years if you are the one that gets to say it then i will admit ive been bamboozled this whole time disclaimer ive played before and am undefeated but if youre so confident play this case will be overturned after appeal and trump will be president bonus democrats will say its russias fault
leftest do not even know this case is beyond the statue of limitations they are being played
trump haters hate it is hate people hate is evil you will loose everything when you watch trump become loved by the world i am not american all you need is __ __ __ __
whos a victim here
funny how other businesses manage to be nimble honestly using generally accepted accounting principles and being transparent about their finances it would really help these discussions if you featured successful honest people who are doing well for comparison
dont worry donald the presidents salary is 400000 a year that is before the garnishment order
the people that judge just pissed off will frame his ass just as quickly as he framed trumps ass that man fd up
can any of you tell me what happens if he appeals then they would have to prove their was a victim who was the victim was it the banks or loan companies wait they made millions so no was it uh oh no one what does that mean if he appeals i will get overturned oh no but orange man bad wahhhh hahaha talk to you all in 9 months silly goofy sheep never learn
putin is taking notes on how demoncrats interfer in an electionnext up dnc to rig primaryagain
trump is a con thats the bottom line here
what a scam and a travestythe us has became a banana republic
trump is a crooked and evil person lock him up
the judge stand above the law get him to jail
800 clearly decades of fraud are not enough in america to have your licence to do business permanently withdrawn
200 million people who love trump van bail him outno amount t of mo ey will be able to rebuild nyc after we boycott business and tourismnyc citizens can pick up the tax bill nowlolol

bravo to the judge he is in my eyes a real judge who cant be bribed by trump none sense like this judge
fani willis disasteralso outrageous new york judicial abuse against trump httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv_ldzwy4k4u0
trump is more outraged over the blow to his ego than to his bank accounts he raised 125m after 2020 election loss when he begged for to pay lawyers afterward his lawyers griped they got less than 20 of the it wont surprise me if this time adoring fans are already cashing in their retirement and childrens college funds to send him
the vile left attacking a patriotic american
yes but his daughter is not stopped from running his businesses for him so he still has control
the maga has to send him more money more court is come in
a lot of corruption we are all taking notes
not surprised the trumps are notorious cheaters liars theyre greedy entitled new york scumbags thats why no us bank would loan trump money he had to go to a german bank and thats why there are a mountain of stories behind the terrible trump reputation in ny
this will backfire on nyand democrats when their taxes go up as a result of anchor businesses pulling of of nyc dont celebrate prematurely new york libs
i can almost see putin sighing then opening his checkbook again
cnn and this deranged judge are completely inseign or just plain stupid take your pick i think its both
trump wont have enough money to put up as bond to appeal the ruling oh well he should not break the law in the first place he will be limited in runnng his business which is really just a giant griftmoney laundering scheme anyway
you need to be fighting for the country instead of distroying trump cant you see its not working of course you cant
maybe he should ask taylor swift to loan him the money
it has always been a grift and a fraud
she just used a calculator to do some quick math
awesome job judge thank youall this conman wants is the peoples money not a care in the world about the grassroots and the people in general
wont happen liberal traitors have no idea obviously whats really going on and whats coming we caught them all
we must be done talking about the mass shooting errrrrr victims caught in a gangland crossfire isnt it funny that a few years ago cnn lectured us that the gang crossfire that people died from in california was not a mass shooting the people running this network are criminals they dont have bad judgment they dont have bad opinions they are criminals this is america they told the american people a lie for 3 days straight that they knew was a lie they knew the first half hour exactly what this was and yet portrayed it as a mass shooting insinuating for a long time that it was trump supporters it is almost time for the any means necessary lines to start coming out because that is where we are with these people
question you know why trumps book art of crooked deals is much thicker than mary trumps book answer 5 chapter 11s
confidence man finally nabbed in new york ny what comes next
how much money do you think nyc will lose when businesses pull out yugegood riddance ny hope you welcome the mob that retakes nyc

in my country its illegal to pay finds with donations as its a punishment you haft to pay if someone elses pays it your not getting punished
melanias going to leave you if you go bankrupt after all she didnt marry you for your looks and personality
there are no victims all loans were repaid the supposed victim banks testified in defense of trump and the judge orders trump to pay 355 million
cant get a fair trial in ny before the trial he is assumed guilty already was not surprised the judge himself is bias like the media
when is that money due
leftists face your future maga is coming and there is nothing stopping the trump train
do you think melania has packed her designer suitcases yet shes not as supportive as she used to be bye bye donald
that judge is a disgusting creep
qick call the kitchen at mara lardo tell them to hide the ketchup

rigged it should be 500m
hes fed this judgment will cause every bank to call in any open lines of credit he has until paid all of his property will be subject to state liens preventing him from getting even secured debt until it is paid any property he sells will be sold below market rate because buyers will know hes desperate for cash i hope hes driving my uber the next time i visit nyc ill give him 1 star
i am palestinian and trump is my next president and the president of the world and biden and blinken are in the dustbins of history a conspiracy by bidens supporters against the best president who brought peace to the world and the history of the united states
these court proceedings are political theatre to keep liberal dimwits clapping like seals while the entire world burns around them
for you trumpers who are complaining just some words of advice shake it off sincerely a swiftie vote blue
anyone with any association with grace can see the judge in this case has none and is a lost soul all trumps loans were paid and banks made millionsso latisha did exactly what for new yorkersbring in arab investors to take those propertys people are such brainwashed fools
doing business for 40 years no interest in getting trump he donated to them he runs for president every black soros funded politician in the country indicts him lol
trumhitler make america great again pay up mob boss victory for the usaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
brash hypocrites left they throw a rock and believe that they can cover the sunlight with a finger
god bless americas justice system today tomorrow and forever amen
us legal system is laughable a tragedy for the future
who does he pay
trump will not pay because nato are not paying their shares lol
absolute bs theyre trying to bankrupt him so he cant run just know a stolen election will not fly this time trust that
ridiculous corrupt and totally against our constitution lock and debar the corrupt judge
lol the american corrupt system will try anything to control the election
the left so desperate to stop him running for president because the are scared
trump is proudly a multi billionaire a billion is a thousand million so whats the big deal about paying 355 million if hes a multi billionaire thats more than 2 billion 2000 million so trump must still have at least 1645 million thats 16 billion and still call himself a billionaire not a mere lowlife millionaire this invites the question if hes so concerned about having to pay out 355 million does he really have that much or has he been posing pretending to be a billionaire
pay up trump you know we have to pay right like u said
now you are deff banana country
the comments are scary stupid
when an honest conservator runs his businesses lawfully it will become the new chuck e cheese and even that is exaggerating their prospects
democrats have ruined this country
not much difference between us and putins legal system is america going to send him to a gulag and mistreat him until he dies the message is clear dont stand up to the deep state love from england
ai judge is preferable
thats about 100 a lie
if anyone votes for a democrat you have lost your mind this is a total scam
the banks didnt have a problem with anything what a scam by the ny justice system totally corrupt
they are found guilty and then stand barking into a microphone cowards cheats and fraudsters trump the banks and accountants stole millions of dollars they all made money where do you think that money came from answer us the people who borrow from banks for cars homes and medical bills
we are no longer living in the united states of america
trump on phone to taylor swift hey you got any money just laying around the house like 365 millionclick phone hangs up
we are no longer living in the united states of america
no one was defrauded the ruling is insanity totally corrupt a shakedown for a business mans money and hos business
listen to what the reporter is saying trump have inflated the value of properties to get better loans rate on loans and insurance and to pay less in taxes first of all this was never a case about tax fraud second this statement makes no fucking sense if you get better loans and pay lower interest rates you will pay more taxes not less but this is cnn they think you are stupid and they are full of shit
judge engoron is a national treasure
thank you judge engoron
do banks not do due diligence why are the banks not suing him who is the aggrieved party why is taxpayer money being spent on this
like to see this judge get investigated
what for what reason the judge and the democrats are out of control with their corruption if you have a business in ny you better watch out because youre next in their corrupt shakedown scam get out of ny now while you can
they wont see a dime
dr evil i want 370 gazillion shabadabadillion dollars how ridiculous i guess a win for optics for the time being is still a win you all know its going to be reverseddismissed on appeal instantly and i suspect the appeals ruling will also give trump inc a way to sue ny for damages to his company and punitive damages as well judge engoron focused completely on the fact that he and his organization may have knowingly inflated the property value to get a better deal in simplest terms that would be considered a lie in business with a bank that would also be equivalent to telling a bank that is giving a loan i need this much money this is what i think my property is worth i can get a loan with any bank i want so its best that you loan me as close to the amount i need and we will do business together a very long time and thats exactly what the did loan after loan and year after year every loan was repaid the bank made millions of trump the bank knowingly did a risk assessment and it was a no brainer and everyone made lots of money in the process not only that every loan application signed by trump and trump inc clearly stated that the property value provided was a guesstimation and that the bank was responsible in doing its standard underwriting to reflect a closer to current market value estimation this was their decision to make as to either take his word for it or underwrite the property to reflect current market value judge engoron sidestepped this issue completely even the banks involved testified there was no problem with the valuation given by trump trump is what they refer to as a whale they typically get better rates than posted due to the sheer magnitude of financial gains a partnership with them represent all parties satisfied and like a broken record no one was harmed in any shape or form during or after the financial transaction between both parties again this appeal will last less than a week to be completely reversedoverturned when the appeals trial starts
judge arthur engoron hit donald trump with his biggest punishment to date on friday in a ruling that fined the former president 355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties engoron found trump liable for fraud conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records and he barred him from serving as director of a company in new york for three years but while he stopped short of dissolving the trump organization altogether engoron issued a blistering 93page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again legal experts say former president donald trump is likely to use a bond secured with his assets as collateral as the first step in satisfying the judgment in the new york civil fraud case brought by new york attorney general letitia james on friday judge arthur engoron ordered trump and his companies to pay nearly 355 million which trump has vowed to appeal under a socalled appeal bond trump would put up a percentage of the judgment and a thirdparty company that is the guarantor is on the hook for the full amount said joshua naftalis a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in new york its difficult to determine the full assets available to trump because his business is a privately held concern and does not regularly file reports with regulators in a deposition taken last year as part of the case brought by james the former president said his company had more than 400 million in available cash adam leitman bailey a real estate attorney in new york said trump likely would have to put up 10 of the judgment in cash plus an additional fee in january a jury in a civil defamation case ordered trump to pay 833 million to former magazine columnist e jean carroll on top of the 5 million verdict she had already won against him last year trumps attorneys argued during the trial that the attorney generals claims against trump had no victims the banks were paid back and were eager to do business with trump but the attorney general argued and the judge agreed that the fraudulent loans trump received at lower rates had an impact on the marketplace plus the law used to bring the claims against trump does not require there to be victims of fraud in a traditional sense
happy by pharrell httpsyoutubezbzse6n_bxssizogr2wcmdhyrnfr_
im sure the trumps can always resort to building a trump tower in moscow
trump stiffed michael cohen and he took revenge this case is directly linked to cohens testimony i bet he is feeling prety happy today
i wish people would stop referring to dementia donnie as a former president the word president should never ever be used to describe that pos
there are no victims so who is going to receive these
i thought cnn went bankrupt who watches this channel anymore besides ai robots
these people are more fraudulent than trump
this fucker is not going to spend a dime of his own money to pay for this its going to be paid by the campaign donors and the so called republican party
the only thing trump worries about is his money
how egregious was trumps behavior it sounds like playing around with valuations is par for the course in the real estate world
if trump wins i believe these judges should be imprisoned for what they are doing
theres a lot of zeros here yes and the settlement number is pretty big too
this is so much bs
the system needed justice served and especially this judge abuse of power committing fraud this bank fraud judge new he had the testimony from professional bankers that mr trump didnt commit bank fraud the blind folded woman with sword of justice of truth in any court of law this crooked judge ignored substantial evidence of facts beyond a shadow of doubt mr donald j trump formal president is innocent this crooked judge on bank fraud is the one of abuse of power of fraud mr trump is not being treated by law and getting justice the court transcript has the bankers testimony and this should show how crooked judges can rule wrongful and not held accountable getting justice served and stop in the future how many more people this judge would abuse his power commit fraud
is that trumpie or an old picture of al jolson singing mammy and is trumpie now wearing lip gloss if trumpie uses any more makeup hell be trying out for ru pauls drag race

once again trump is proven a total loser
give the money to ruby freeman and her daughter as punitive damages for the danger trump put them in they had to leave their homes because of death threats from maga supporters pay up trump you said you are a billionaire

cmon magats heres your chance to prove how loyal you are to your dear leader put your money where your mouth is a help your leader leader out here
partisan judge issues bs judgement to prevent populist president from becoming president again surprise we have truly become a banana republic
the judge looks sort of evil
does he have to pay it or can he just default
there are a lot of zeros
his soninlaw can lend him the cash if hes creditworthy
more than cnn is worth
now the only way out is to become president and sell it to putin
in most countries fraud is a crime fiddle an insurance claim and you go to prision why has this man not in a prison for ever
he is a conman a fraud
as little donnie the rapist said this is all erics fault michael cohen has thrown trump under a pram a great day and a bit of justice to michael

harpers back
its time for them trump boys to get a job junior can work at fast food eric can live off his wife
how is trump feeling right now well ask steve martin from the car scene in trains planes and automobiles
disgorgment does not mean illgotten gains disgorgement is the name of the penalty that requires the defendant to surrender his illgotten gains
lawfare at its best the banks and insurance companies all did their own due diligence and loaned him the money the banks and the insurance companies were all repaid plus interest and were not party to the lawsuit the estimation of the property values and the deal is subjective there are no aggrieved parties pursuant to the deal and no one has been damaged and this is from a judge has already shown himself to be partisan and who valued the mara largo property in florida at only 17 million usd despite the land it is sitting on being a worth at least 200 million usd according to local real estate agents so once again well go down the appeals road incidentally who here who has bought or sold a house or other property and claimed it is worth x but someone else not party to the sale or purchase or lean steps in and says it is worth some other sum bc they dont like your politics would like such tactics to be used against them this is a political hitjob and that is how low us politics now dredges it is not who it is happening to but what is being done that is a major concern
you got to love this he is finally paying for what he is done illegal in new york
another great friday in america thank you letitia james
is there anyone celebrating in this comment section who wants to advocate for the position that this case would have been brought if trump was a democrat if you believe that then you live in an information bubble and have a warped view of reality if you acknowledge that this was political persecution using the courts then you shouldnt be celebrating because it wont stop here your side will get the sae treatment when power changes hands as it always does and our system of governance will be made more corrupt because people who challenge or contradict entrenched power and interests will now notbdo so lest they get the trump treatment this is just going to further strengthen incumbent power and corruption be honest the law was not applied to every other new york real estate developer who ever inflated the value of collateral trump wasnsingledmout and that makes us a nation of men not laws and equal justice under law is all that separates us from animals
maybe his maga followers will come up with the 355 million
leadership requirement 1 integrity this guy lacks that capability which now limits him to do business in ny at least for a number of years seems consistent with his political track record
judge is a lunatic
after the appeal watch how much trump pays in 10 year lol
the fraudfather and his crime family is finally found guilty
sheeps
how many times will trump be found guilty before his followers admit hes guiltywake up people youve been scammed by an orange narcissistic sociopath
this is bullcrap
the grifter will fleece his flock of maga zealots
who cares about the fucking moneythe point is that idiot needs to be charged of corupcion and he needs to be put on jailwho is posible hes running for presidentwhat a joke
so thats over a billion between fox and their daddy and counting
now the maga fools understand why trump never turned in his tax returns unlike every president before him has done
how do you have a trial without a jury
pay up sucker
they got orders from ccp
now make maga lose again this november usa
mr wonderful slams trumps civil ruling as unamerican and a shock to the entire real estate industry
lets celebrate the judiciary system is showing signs of life
only a liberal half wit would have hair that looks like that judges
cheater
so this clown show of a trial is over for now i just have a few questions where is the money going to with no real victim is it going to help repair and clean up ny or to pay for more immigrants to come live for free
the federal law allows the death penalty that use color of law to maliciously prosecute so as to deny persons of their rights donald trump can use the law to defend himself his family and his business httpswwwjusticegovcrtdeprivationrightsundercolorlaw
pay your bills sorry but i like the irony
god must be pissed off to find out his choosen one is finnaly a pathological lier and looser
give him social payments to live on and make him live on it for an extended period
keep the fines coming
the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice mlk
wonder exactly how long it will take for the trump org to try and pull a fast one on the assigned monitor these people are addicted to committing fraud hmm no victimlets think about that logicallyumm city of new york tax revenue in turn programs which may have benefited by that money banks being ripped off not really caring about the bank itself but who do you think that loss is passed down too you and me increased fees etc contractors who got ripped off them period actual direct victims all that comment proves is exactly how disconnected trump and his cronies are from normal people and how they dont actually give a crap
would letitia be interested in running for the oval by any chance she would have my vote
bs if trump is dishonest then do is judge egore or he wouldnt of been bought and would of came back with some integrity and thru this out from the start hes just as ugly in the end but the ppl that love this shit are blind led fools
karma is a bitch donny
who gets the money i can only guess whose pockets will be lined take money from a crook and give it to some other crooks
two people with tds who should be removed from their positions
and yet all the bankers received their money back plus interest and were not claimants banks and insurers did their own due diligence this is lawfare and a hitjob against trump
are you tired of winning remember when trump said it lost the house lost the senate lost the presidency lost the popular vote twice lost 88m to e jean carol lost law suits left and right including the law suit against trump university lost over 355m my god todaysnd it wont stop there maga im not trying to be sarcastic but are tired of winning or loosing i would say are you sure you are voting for trump move onforget about trump trump is a proven looser
who says that this court verdict will stick who says that this outrageous radicalism should stick president trump built one third of nyc and this is how new york treats him really
well done new york
we got you trump no worries
gideon levy an israeli columnist and political commentator says theres a great opportunity for the international community to step in and finally end israels illegal occupation of palestinian territory israel refused for decades even before netanyahu to go for a real settlement for the palestinian problem therefore it is time for the international community to say enough is enough levy told the world israel launches wars every few years and destroys gaza and then the international community must fund its rehabilitation he said it puts risk over the whole world as all kinds of other tensions rise because of the conflict in gaza the international community should say enough leaving it to israel it is time for the international community to impose a solution otherwise it will go on like this forever
the entire republican party staked its future on a fraud wow this cast a glaring light on the political campaign contributors hoping to profit from the king of fraud being reelected potus the irs needs to do a deep dive into the financials of every major republican party political campaign donor i bet we can find enough unpaid taxes to fully fund social security the veterans administration address the mental health crisis and pay down a significant portion of the national debt of course us supreme court justices lavish lifestyles shall be severely curtailed
is that all
if he didnt screw michael cohenhed never been in this karma
so i guess mara largo is only worth 18 million dollars also a victim was conjured out of thin air not one bank or financial institution claimed fraud so where is the victim hell i didnt vote for trump but i have bought a house or two ive also borrowed money using a house as collateral the bank always gets the property appraised if its business property they allow for potential profit margins when valuing your business as a black business man im sorry but this stinks to high heaven whats worse is its wasting everyones time this case will never survive appeal once it leaves ny state im a liberal but im fair if this is now what it means to be a liberal i guess its time to look at the other party
about time take them out of new york and the usa
what about the bankruptcy debt which would have been false
resentment vindictiveness envy and schadenfreude inhabit the realm of very dark minds those who enjoy dwelling within these selfsabotaging cultivated states of mind are in sustained turmoil and torment
everybody wants to get some money from trump
pathetic
if you vote blue then fu
còrrųpt judges and a weaponized justice systems made by corrupt dems to prevent the qualified and popular person from presidency
f ny he should get out of ny all together tx would love the trump tower ny is going to shit anyways who cares about them they vote for chaos crime and love the felons
leopard never changes spots buisness or president
the judge gets to decide what your property is worth now folks the banks didnt ask for an appraisal they asked what he thought it was worth this is common practice even the banks told the judge it is common practice what a witch hunt as they even said a victimless crime
only a fool would think trump would have to pay that the supreme court loves him
cnn anchors experience a climax with this judgement but after their cigarette they should really interview attorney robert barnes httpswwwyoutubecomwatchve7hz9uplc3y
trump will use the contibution fund from his maga fan to pay for portion of this
you folks think trump is paying even 100 of this thats how dumb you are
bs i suggest everyone who owns a home or real estate look up your taxable value
your delinquentyou have to pay your bills id encourage them to do whatever hell they want donald trump
how could a us present to make 355 as a present could the judge name one
come on sheep buy more gold bars with clowns on them better get to grifting chump trumps a dirtbag
i hope to see mrtrump to be a president

all this is bs that judge is not neutral he is doing political interference nothing happens to hillary clinton joe biden and sontrump 2024
trump is running out of funds that cant be paid back trouble
the ugly judge approaches again for money only strange the amount is the amount newyork lost in people moving away
meanwhile the guy who robs the corner store gets 5 years in prison
justice has been served to the convicted rapist criminal charges forthcoming
the ny sleezeball system would not investigate the clinton foundation ran out of their city anytime soon pathetic they can just pick and chose their political judicial system
yet hes still not in jail if you ever wanted to see the divide between how the law works for rich people compared to poor people this is it if this was a regular everyday person they would have thrown them in jail and thrown away the key already our legal system is a total joke
looks like golf course fees have gone up lol the whole fraudulent family got there short arms and long pockets torn off them lmao what a great day for democracywooop wooop
citizen trumps pandora box started like mole hill heading for mount everest
the deep police state protects their own well when you have the full force of the unelected deep state that runs the dem uniparty rinos the current administration our government agencies most of our courts law offices corporations special interest groups and allow other countries our enemies nato who un ruin uh run our states and our nation what do you expect history and proven over and over and the maga crowd knows the real goal of socialism is the elites total control of their citizens forced tyranny
unfortunately the money is paid by the trump org investors time to vote him out of the company like pappa johns owner hsd yo step down trump will just commit fraud in fl and other states
he and his sons are banned from doing business in new york or borrowing money there for three years there is no discrediting any accusation that donald trump and his family are frauds reputation is everything required for trust hes toast except among the delusional
we got this the maga crowd made up of all races sexes color creeds and political parties vs the democratic socialist hll bent on fundamentally changing our nation as china joe promised this time without the dem cheating reelect a dem or uniparty member and they will only double down thank god for the electoral college trump 2024 to clean up this mess and slow socialist coup and maga a
now trump he asks at ivanka husband for money because he made 2 billion dollars in his administration
as fake as his hair
i guess president trump will take his second term salary for lunch money
judge orders trump to pay 355 million in civil fraud trial then theres the 833 million plus the original 5 million for ej carrol then there is the 76 million over last two years on attorneys as legal troubles thats 519 million and counting tired of winning yet hope his trumptard followers are getting out their checkbooks
lock him up
his sons should follow to jl all quite hes now all this winning feb 2024
this is exactly why he didnt want to release his taxes
should have held trial in salem ma
note that the judge said trump was not someone terrible like bernie madoff why not samuel bankman fried or is sbf now a dnc martyr
this one just might be the best news presented this year lololol we might just let putin do the collection or else jajajajaja
im not on anyones side but this stuff looks like a good old fashioned lynching this is looking like the game monopoly you dont play by the rules they take your toys away the judge literally looks like some ancient depiction of a demonhuman hybrid
if i were trump sell trump tower and anything he has going on in nyc get out of the blue states and head down to florida
banana republicwake up americans you can and will be next should you keep being a foolish believer of govt controlled media propaganda including the hate for donald trump whos on the peoples sideits why they hate him so much
take him out
is the judge going to fine or suspend every other new york businessman or corporations from doing business like he did trump given they all do this why is trump the only one accused and charged with this it is selective prosecution and against trump all other real estate moguls do this same thing the marketplace nor any bank was ever hurt or damaged by trump
after this ruling trump will bleed the rnc dry
homeless people in nyc should start squatting in trump tower
dont count your chickens til the eggs hatch
yet another miscarriage of justice but trump will appeal and the judgement will be cancelled hope he pulls everything out of ny and moves to somewhere that isnt run by a bunch of crooks and all the people will be out of a job who work for him im sure they will really appreciate that da who started this and that bent judge
i want these judges to demand immediate payment and not allow him to go bankrupt again
run away to russia putin will take care of you trump and i know you will do better over there
perhaps is time for the irs also conduct a investigation just like they did to commey and the other fbi high official that trump requested on them two that is call on poker game a real trump card
florida wants to thank ny he will take all his money and buisness there dumercrats ruin everything they thouch
it just shows what a corrupt cesspool new york is ill tell you one thing you can definitely call him president donald trump how did they find a good person guilty before the trial only in new york he will never pay a dime and rightfully so
money doesnt control the law the law controls money and donald trump isnt an exception
trump has the right to appeal the verdict but to do so he must put the money on the table in his testimony he boasted that the trump organization has more than 400 million in cash
trump is americas alexei navalney
id hate to see how bad this woud have been if he didnt hire the best people great job alina
biased judge paid and controlled by the liberals to bankrupt trump on bullshit charges
arent you guys tired of getting wrecked maga dam give him up find a new hero this dude is orange juice dam
his cell husband will be getting an ear full very soon
dramatic day for two of the greatest opposition leaders in the contemporary world
he got off easy
say it correctly its 100m in penalities so its 464million you all
if you listen closely you can hear me laughing from australia
its not 355 its 354 millions 1m is very huge to me
its going bad and i know what side ill be on
the biggest fake news propaganda so called wanna be journalists what a joe u actually support a banana republic and u support homas a terrorists group its amazing the corruption in the democrats party pathetic
cnn if you take the side that this verdict is fair and justifiable you are a propogandists or mentally slow such a verdict has never occurred before not one client of his lost one pennyif he was anyone else but donald trump they would not have been chargedhey i have developed real estate and everyone estimates their assets at the highest possible level feasible and he admonished each lender to perform their own appraisalsthat alone should excuse any over estimations on his partthis case was filed due to his political aspirations and beliefsf that political hack judge who is a total retard with respect to real estate valuations ultimately it is just an opinion btw i am an independent
whos the crime family now who which family
finally he is a crook
the worst part is trump has to take everybody out for ice cream and they get to order whatever they want
so now it is clear and evident the rapist is also a megalomaniac fraudster that for decades defrauded the state of new york never a real businessman always a fraudster and the father and mentor of fraudsters never someone fit to serve as president of the united states
misinformation i have noticed the judges and these cases are all a joke give me a break witch hunt
stupid dump he used to make money and committed frauds left and right but no one paid attention until he had to draw attention from running the highest office
habba has cost trump almost half a billion worst lawyer ever
what about the hundreds of small businesses hes ripped off
alina habra could you give your client his money back youre useless and cost him biglyyoull never have a high profile client ever again
now do ivanka she knowingly lied to investors in a number of projects and they lost million
trump should give them a extra 200 milion as a tip chomp change for the god
art of deal how to hide fraud to make a deal and hopefully not get caught oooopsloser
trump wont pay a cent he will appear against this unjust ruling
our country is broken and corrupt i hope president trump can file an appeal god bless you president trump
lets see how the pompous arrogant trump sons uday and ousay trump mouth off
finally justice
i would have added something even more to the award mandatory castration
the judge doesnt have the legal right this isnt russia
this is government stealing via lawfare tactics trump paid off all his loans wether they were over appreciated or not
my heart bleeds purple pifor the fat aorange want to be dictator
bad decisions have bad consequences reap it trump
he thought all his winnings from fraud will never be uncoveredhe was wrong he thought his rape would go awayhe was wrong he thought he could stop the voting process by saying it was fraud even before the electionhe was wrong what a loser
democrat criminals in government are wayyyy out of control there was no fraud no victim no crime nothing even unusual this is just blatant election tampering by tyrannical democrat operatives weaponizing the courts against a political opponent not a chance this stands on appeal literally no crime these democrat criminals in robes simply want to destroy trump financially cnn supports democrat criminals but americans dont trump can only grow stronger as you leftist criminals attack democracy
this is to much
the democrats have tried so hard to get trump they are going to get trump when he is elected in november well done the judges bias in finding trump guilty before the hearing took place will see this case tossed out on appeal what trump has done is no different to how the millions of other business people and the banks do which they support watch this case ultimately fail like all the others that have been politically driven
he needs cuff
i hope the judge is disbarred and placed under arrest as well as the prosecutor
putin just has the leading candidate in a russia election murdered seems things are more efficient in russia
that guy living in a cardboard box down the street is now officially richer than mango mussolini congratulations dude
this should be appealed and judge removed for bias and prefjuce and request change of venue
also trump is hemorrhaging 510 million a month for his many legal bills most of the golf courses are running in the red too he is not the multi billionaire he pretends to be and that truth coming to light is going to make him behave in an even worse deranged manner
trump burried the mother of his kids on his golf court so he could save taxes
youre finished trump and thats only the beginning run donald free the country get in your jet go to russia and never bring your antiamerican ass back
truly disgusting cnn
how the system punishes sounds wild
not biased at all
this is clearly evil against your fellow citizen if you are a christian and you want to vote these evil democrate in power then you have side with the devil this is witch hunt against one man
what a joke i dont care who you are or if you like or hate trump this verdict can only be seen as a joke because any real estate person will tell you this is how business is done around the world including the us cases like this are the reason i will not vote for democrats cases like this put us all in danger both republicans and democrats the people that are happy at this outcome are only happy because they got trump i couldnt care less just know the justice system seems to be getting abused with cases like this
trump has gotten away with a lot of fraudulent dealings is time for him to pay his dues to society not only on the civil side but on the criminal side too
this has been another operation to change our electiopn again putin and a group of paid off republicans tried to influence the election with fake burisma charges againdst biden all centered on ukraine that putin is trying to conquer as part of his europe plan putin killed navalny as soon as his burisma hit operation on biden was discovered to push it from the news cycle think about this for one minute and you will know this is absolute truth
so great trump is just burning hehe
he may have to go to russia and live with his daddy
lets bankrupt trump out of the election
this ruling will not standtrump will appeal this decision
the comments are hilarious thanks for the laughs
to all u maga supports theirs your successful businessman
thats why he want nato to pay more money
the brand trump is totally worthless and he will find out shortly just how much when he has to pay his fines 5m 88m for the e jean carroll verdict 350m for this ny trial thats close to 12 billion dollars in security that he has to pay before appeals will be heard all his assets are tied up by the courts in ny he is cash poor next up he has to face the irs who are investigated him as well another 100 million looms here as well top all this off with his legal costs this guy his heading for total bankruptcy
dont convicts usually have to stay in jail until they get a bond
the judge democrats corruption
great the rnc and his cult donors can throw in all their money to help him bankrupt the whole rotten lot in one fell swoop
it wont hurt trump at all
trumpie to prison yes finally justice
yeah really win for new york you idiots ultimately new york will suffer from their own ruling
appellate push backwtf is that bs
he committed no crime wtf
trump will not pay because just like the nato allies not paying their shareslol
screw you dems you wait
that judge is just not fair look at him laughing democrat all the way he is not holding up to his oath what sham and shameful to the human race it looks like a vendetta against mr trump and his family
that judge is a crook and a bum
aoc for president aoc and not da james is the one who exposed it while questioning michael cohen at a committee hearing
trump is cash poor hell never pay carol or this
the stable genius is out here losing again
correction wasnt it expresident trumps soninlaw jerrod kushner that returned from saudi arabia with billions given to him by the saudis what was that for no wonder the maga republicans are attacking the irs
we gonna see how deep his pockets be except for what he stash in china or russia
yes the wheels of justice move slowly but they do move ty judge engoran
for ripping off the public in the bernie maddoxs ponzi scheme he gets life in prison and the think the repossession of ill gotten gains for ripping off the federal govt in trumps fraud scheme he gets no prison time and no repossession of ill gotten gains instead he gets fined 354 million and no business in ny state for a few years i dont see the justice here
there is never a victimless crimean oxymoronic argument someone always picks up the tab
with all these judgements against trump he should be broke in no time all his assets should be taken or have leans in them this makes me happy finally seeing him actually face the music trumps mo is tho delay delay delay and appeal appeal appeal and then blame blame blame he will never admit to anything its always somebodys fault its always the democrats trying to stop him from becoming president its bidens doing its obama planning his demise or its not a crime hes always right never wrong im sick of trump i do not condone what happened to jfk or mlk but it would not bother me one bit if i turned on the news and found out that trump and putin were jfkd minutes apart as a matter of fact i would celebrate i would actually take the day off and party like a rock star
reading the comments i do not believe a single person knows what this case was about trump didnt owe taxes didnt owe bills nothing like that the case was weather trump inflated the values of his home and business to secure loans thats it a judge who already said trump was guilty before day one of court handed down an official verdict today yeah im sure thats legit this is nothing more than politicians a crocked judge and an attorney trying to assure trump is not reelected with no witness no evidence nothing thing is though his support just keeps growing even lifelong dems can see the writing on the wall and are walking away from the party the more dems throw things at the wall to see if they stick trump will appeal and win with a real judge who cant be bought by the dems and we all know it and for the petes sake people if youre going to comment on a story please understand what the story is and dont comment with made up lies just to throw dirt thats just sad and makes you look obtuse
i know that all the companiespeople he railroaded are all smiles not that they get anything but that hes finally gotten caught
arent there many other cases left yet also
pay up deadbeat
ah man i guess no more christmas bonus for his loosing lawyers and rudy g k
thoughts and prayers
love it
very interesting trump will have to sell a 3rd of maralago to pay for this lmao so obvious the deep blue state corruption who would do business in new york you reap what you sew i guess
goodbye democracy all you democrats who are celebrating will not be celebrating when the now new political weaponization of the judicial system gets turned on you and it will clown show
trump has to pay his share for ukraine and israel the warmonger liberals are giving them 100s billions for free
yeah wright hel pay you tomorrow
nato reaction
he wont pay a dime
trump wont be singing i love new york new york
where are they getting these numbers from this is insanity complete bs they are clearly just trying to bankrupt him as fast as they can
mr and mrs rural maga need to send more money to his pac so he can grift it and pay his judgements
buy bitcoin
i heard not even the check he will be allowed to sign for three years yea just give him a rattle but not the check book
pay up donald trump or no one will defend you just kidding youre not worth defending
good job now its time to make trump to pay some good time in prison
the bigliest loser loses again
ask putin to help you pay you have been working for him for years stinky
the amt is ok especially if you dont have it i do however feel that a 10yr suspension of licenses in nys is more appropriate 2 or 3 yrs make s no impact in 10yrs the offspring great grands will be adults some and maybe more responsible than their predecessors they shd not be punished but their grandpa and fathers shd be
if there is a dark side to this country that hate trump so much they would re elect biden or any democrat that thinks like biden then americas gone
which bank complained we will still vote for him
are u all high in there dreamland
the judge was bias with an axe to grind this opens the door to shakedown those they dont like corruption in the justice system
wonderful news
going to supreme court
they will never see a dime idiots
judge engoron is my new hero the beginnings of a happy ending to a sad chapter in american history
dear liberals good luck collecting on that trump will be president later this year and biden will be just an ugly memory enjoy your hollow victories your time is coming
as a democrat we have to recognize its undemocratic to try to stop an opponent from running this is very thugish an just unfair decent people seek for fair competition and fair election im shamed to be a democrat in todays world
this is why he wants to a dictator he will never have to lose ever again if you vote him to the office consider yourselves doomed
thats a boatload of money
its the first against the fake billionaire
trump will settle for 355
finally
am i remembering correctly didnt all banks in the united states refuse to lend trump any more money and so he had to go to deutcher bank a foreign bank he had to go to china russia did he sell something to the saudis what was that in trumps adult son dons briefcase was that a sale to the saudis why did he return with billions of dollars it could not have been for nothing could it
i imagine that trumps boys are working the phones hard right now maybe the trump org will put on a nationally televised telethon to raise the money
yeah next please also go after ron desantis and vivek ramaswamy also i would like to add megyn kelly greg gutfeld and my nextdoor neighbor connie can we please get the dept of justice and attorney general to go after them all thanks
yahoo trump baby has a court appointed baby sitter for 3 years its not long enough cause he will never grow up
its not going to effect trump at all however it will hugely negatively effect the city of new york as it should
it couldnt have happened to a nicer guy
tfg45doe174 has been an alleged fraudster for decades and its about time he has been dealt consequences instead the pos keeps sucking all the air out of americas real business of running the country can we not move on now
wow 355 million plus 833 million for the rape when are people going to learn the courts do not order you to pay this type of money unless your guilty these are real crimes that trump thinks he should get away with that fact should prove to the gop that trump will only cause more and more problem and will make his problems those of the united states send this criminal to prison not the white house
the comments here are so ignorant trump is getting the book thrown at for something nearly every independent business owner does it is simply the way the system works the only victims here would be insurance corporations or huge banks in the event of a total loss which of course never happened
in order for the government to collect the money they will put liens on the trump organization properties by red lighting them then he cant sell them or rent them out any money collected goes straight to the government to pay the judgements
this is soooo rigged soros
its a life of actions and consequences
nothing devastating about the out come he has done so many people wrong his has lied enough and this time he can not say your fired to avoid paying
make america great again put trump in jail 2024 and more
cnn dont blow this you can do it call donald a criminal baby steps
28 years difference between james and narhan fani got laid nathan got paid tax payers got played maga 2024
justice be done thank goodness
as far as im concerned this is only a good start and i might be satisfied if this asshole isnt allowed in any part of our government ever again and this asshole is forced to spend the rest of his natural life rotting behind bars the optimal word here being might
idiots reporting to idiots watching djt will win on appeal judge a nut case and blew it by making guilty statement before trial
cocktails anyone
thanks for helping getting him elected
anything to try and stop americans from choosing a president afterall davos and the bolsheviks will select obamas husband to replace the kid sniffer corruption at the highest level
cnn is scummy network
hell appeal it and use it as fodder for his revenge tour run for the presidency
best of luck mr trump
you reap what you sow 45
this is not a justice system this is a political hit job biden said he was blaming putin for the death of his political opposition what is biden and the democrat swamp doing to trump
love it there still is some semblance of justice left in this country for career criminals suck it donny
because of mayor adams new york city is broken now the judge is making president trumps family hundreds of millions of dollars because of the incompetent mayor and government of new york city and state that money is going to fund illegal immigrants every landlord has triple the rent because of illegal immigrants its unconstitutional to stop president trump from doing business in new york the democrats are robbing president trumps family
hey fatty shack dont do the crime if you cant do the time or pay the fine
russia if your listening i need 355 million and some change
trump has been swallowed up anybody else ever been swallowed up
anticipating trumps appeal trumps fraud is not a victimless crime when trump corralled lower interest rates we normal folks are squeezed out of that pool our loans cost more most importantly wouldnt everybody be encouraged to cheat wildly overstate valuations that puts the banks and insurance companies at risk this is not a victimless crime especially if left unchecked
this is gettin expensive but when you have billions this is just a drop in the bucket trump does have billions so hes good right drinks beer whilst calculating how in the hell this dude is affording all of these legal contretemps
that judge is loony toons
the left is killing the usa there was no fraud no one lost any money this is nothing more than lawfare and cnn is at the front of the linge promoting it
should be a drop in the bucket for a billionaire right
good im tired of seeing this liar fraudaholeclown get away with murder trump may believe hes above the law and better than everyone but hes not he needs to be held accountable for his crimes just like anybody else would in my opinion i believe trump should be in jail while going to court he has committed enough felonies to be in prison the rest of his life he will blame blame blame its getting old the way he deflects his responsibilityaccountability into president biden get this man out of here
pocket change for billionaire theliar45 is very very very very rich now its appeal time biden is so successful in manipulating the courts again sarcasm
there are lots of zeros here love it
will trump actually pay up
tell the truth fake news as soon as they go to a different court it all gets thrown out but since youre fake news youll never tell that
lol hes at 400 million now with this and the other trial glad donnie jr and eric got caught up too
maybe the teflon is wearing off at least a little
and lets see how many idiots will raise their hands by typing fake news
the judge should be disbarred
just saw trumps epic toddler tantrum on tv
fabulous hopefully that with the e jean carroll award will bankrupt trump
the judge convicted trump before the trial started it will get thrown out with the appeal why must everything be so political what happened to fairness and the rule of law moreover there was no victim all the banks were fine with the assessments more evidence of prejudice such a sad thing when the rule of law is misused
this is bullshit and a witch hunt this is clearly political and there was now harm to anyone its the job of the bank to verify the values trump is a good business man and if you find trump guilty of this then the judge has to try every other business man total bullshit
he will never pay a penny of this it will be locked up in appeals for years no evidence was ever presented to convict it is all nonmaterial
a bunch of bs ms jones will have her day
good news trump is crook
that judge is a pos as all democrats are
scanks
everyone knew this was going to happen when the judge automatically finds trump etc guilty lol its bs as usual it will work itself out in the long run regardless of what the dems do
all those legal experts from trump university will come to the rescue certainly
he was found guilty cause he committed a crime yall better wake up
it is less than the 370 million dollars that was asked for but trump does not have that amount in cash
this so called judg should be put on trial and sent to chain gang camp he is a disgrace
it was common knowledge from the very beginning that the judge a trump hater had every intention to rule against trump new yorks justice system is as corrupt as those of any banana republic
judge engoron should have made the ban from doing business in new york at least five years just in case the burnt orange buffoon actually makes it back god forbid into the oval office it would provide one impediment to any financial shenanigans or emolument tomfoolery for his last two years in office personally i think they should ban him for life
gop donors ok you better pay up keep the flowing to ny and the lawyers
i will laugh when trump is president again these liberal judges are out of their minds we the people are seeing what you are trying to do
trump should intrepose the 355 mil and this should start a new round of crazy right wing maga rants
ridiculous it will be appealed and overturned as it should be the judge will be investigated
took long enough
trump needs to get used to being behind those bars
thought the main trial starts im march is this a warmup
even his sons owe money too lmao
wont affect him hes worth 26billion
governments inflate values constantly housing market right now is fraudulently way over inflated
because you all know thats a travesty michael cohen is deplorable your turf
just like that pay up 335m of course its a democrat ny judge trump family is always liable in their eyes smh
the swap is getting drained
meanwhile no one bats an eye at the bidens democrats are the worst hypocrites this world have ever seen
all bullshit they are digging themselves deeper and deeper
how repulsive can a judge be as repulsive as cnn toxic poison and all news media
why of course he does did he add tar and feathers and it seems the democrats still have the most money backing them
a judge trial uh jesus hell of a legal expert
it is a scam from the judge
why you dont seem to be happy
it is well to remember that when any man denies justice to someone that he hates it prepares the way for justice to be denied to someone that he loves wendell willikie
there are only american citizens ergo defining citizens by race creed or color is unconstitutional and in fact racist no one group of citizens can be treated any differently than any other group of citizens but democrats sucker people into chaos and create us and them narratives to keep democrats in office fortunately american citizens are wising up to the sucker scheme democrats play
bs get brandon convicted
welcome to the ussr whats the difference now this is a political attack nothing more when actions like this are celebrated god help us all
if it says trump its a grift and a lie
rules only apply to others but not him by his logic
will get thrown out on appeal
ha ha trump wont pay shit even hitler wouldnt be fined that much this is no headline
meanwhile the biden family of crooks walk away scotfree
judge looks like bernies more liberal brother trump didnt stand a chance
the judge is a fraud trump will appeal we all know how corrupt nyc and state is
trump wont pay a cent the judge is a crook that has no understanding of the law
what else did trump have in common in both of his civil trials a very pretty defensive lawyer besides the judgements with lots of zeros
what about the evidence that the bidens sold american secrets to our enemies millions of dollars this is just another slam by the swamp
trump clearly will appeal and win dems just upset now because hes clearly going to win the election
foolish demoncrats this wont fly god will be in the middle of this
i bet his pr team is prohibiting him from tweeting double it and give it to the next person
not sure about those math skills
the banks didnt complain

its been a great week for america and a bad week for republicans
after his second conviction all the rats are gonna abandon the trump ship
92 pages long could have been put on an index card its all nonsense trump 2024
boom a little taste of reality donnie
that judge is 100 full of sht
he might go bankrupt wouldnt be the first time this scum bucket is the swamp stuff we all talk about how the f does he have any support what exactly has he done
there is justice after all
good luck with that lol trump collects money he doesnt pay it out im sure when he gets re elected he will pardon or dismiss that somehow that judge may regret doing that
i know this wont hurt his reputation with the maga crowd but even if he never pays a single penny its important for evidence of his fraud to be part of the historical record some day our children will need to make sense of this era and will need accurate data to study and understand
djt is his own worse enemy now hes going to go to his supporters and beg for more attorney money how long will that go on when will the well run dry
communist network news looking exited
trumps not paying a penny and will be all your president once again how do u like those apples
that judge is a disgrace fjb
355 million from trump for fraud 83 million for defamation 5 million for rape in civil case where is the gop gonna get the money to keep trump afloat donors are far and few between for wasting money on the dead end trump the good news is that trump cant appeal this to the supreme court he will have to pay
dam dosent he understand the court systems will break his ass payback is a bitch
cnn wrong again also 90m in interest
this judge and the ag james have to be looked into
its amazing how you can say all that with a straight face this is a political sham trial no one was harmed the banks agree with trump the judge specifically and district attorney should be disbarred completely unethical everyone should be ashamed for cheering on such a kangaroo court imagine if they can do this to trump they can do it to anyone of us
bogus made up bs no bank loans money without their appraisers putting value on property
look how happy those those faces are
hope he continues to get the day he deserves
when trump is telling the gop to give him all of their campaign money hes draining the swamp into his own bank account when will this grifting ever end are the gop going to bankrupt themselves too
not lawyer civil fraud is a felony isnt it
maga will say its smart business to go bankrupt to commit crimes and fraud and very smart to end up in court and have to pay millions in fines
maybe well all get lucky and putin will give him asylum
i thought i was bad way back when trump is 99 badder than me
dont pay them a cent thats all they want your money
caught the witch im a warlock
now make your 1st payment were gonna break it up into 12 ez payments
look at this judge make me sick poor trump
massive pop to the pills fooled around and now he finds out
how can a thief and a fraud become president
lol kangaroo court clown judge they will never get a dime no evidence of any wrong doing its a clown show and the judge is corrupt he will get hes just like fanny geting hers
appeals sure but make him pay first on any appeal then those folks can spend decades of excuses and erected hurdles before sending him back penny by penny
average guy here never cheated on my taxes or loan applications but somehow trumpers think its aok that this debauched rapist did exactly that
good i hope this is the beginning of his end im tired of hearing anything from or about any and all trumps if baron was smart as soon as he is old enough he should change his name and move to europe the trump name will mean nothing good in history
in any huge transaction thete is always always a 3rd party appraisal not the bank not you wtf its the banks fault not trumps you mean to tell me all these posts are not home owners obviously or they would know these facts
overturned on appeal the hormonal hillarys are still bitter that she lost
we need a lawful go fund me for trump we will call it the trump vs commie new yorkers fund 10 dollars each voter should cover it
over and next
howdy folks and people around the world i have great news the share jesus christ is returning soon an if you want to be rapture ready its pretty simple one believe that jesus died on the cross and spilled his own blood for are sins was buried and rose on the third day from the dead in glory 2 admit your a sinner and your need him to save you 3 repent your sins on him and in faith and trust and believe in him to save you because as scripture say there be people left behind to face gods wraith and face the mark of the beast were a person will have it on there right hand or forehead so if you stay behind dont take the mark satay in faith to jesus for this time will be hell on earth lucifer will force you to take it do not accept it choose death i pray you and many get saved and my fellow christians spread the word ephesians 28 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god and romans 83139 31 what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us 32 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things 33 who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect it is god that justifieth 34 who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword 36 as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter 37 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us 38 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come 39 nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
swipes card next
if the donald is worth over 6 million as he says he can just write a check for the 355 millionor maybe he can borrow it from jarred
the art of the steal question for all those evangelical christian trump voters what happened to the 9th commandment and the 7th the 8th the 10th
yes and its about time for trump to go down
another kangaroo court decision in our banna republic these criminal judges and das need to be put in prison they would not let trump speak nor allow a jury of his peers he has the right for both and they decided that trump was guilty before the case even started i do not accept this verdict and want accountability for the twotier justice system this insanity must end
donald please continue to use alina habba as your attorney its clear shes doing an awesome job
when is the fake news going to talk about obama having brennan of the cia and the 5 eyes intelligence agencys spy on president trump to affect the election when 7_567
just shut trump towers down see how many people will lose jobs and mew york taxes shut it down
maybe nato can spot him some cash
justice
trump has the reverse midas touch will the gop keep supporting him or will they say its a witch hunt i was an independent voter but i will not vote gop until maga is gone
i just hope donnie keeps using alina habba as his lawyer
boys and girls what lessons have you learn from donald trump perhaps stay out of politics if you have alot to hide hire good lawyers when you get caught pay your bills on time and promptly be taciturn can you give some lessons that i have not enumerated here
it is said the banks and insurance companies never complained and that they got all their money looks like new york city does business different all the us should be wary of doing business with any of new york
hahaha next jail time
i sense a bunch of new nfts coming out soon
putin can cover the bill for his top agent no problem
and trump still has a very good shot at being elected president later this year thats all you need to know about the state of american politics
trump wont be an officer for the trump organization soon once he becomes the president for another 4 years this is a joke and everyone with half a brain knows it the america becomes a laughing stock for the world because of these lunatic judges and prosecutors
of course there will be an appeal i doubt that the appeal will go anywhere except to delay the effects of the decision if i apply for a mortgage the lender will want to see all my income and asset related documents and those documents will be verified before giving me a loan what the lender sees will determine the interest i pay on that loan if i can deceive that lender to get a lower interest rate than if they knew the truth then i win and they lose revenue not only do they lose the interest revenue as a company but all of the shareholders lose revenue as well it doesnt matter if i paid the debt on time they are still losing money compared to what they would have made if they had known the truth
trump and his goons still got off easy even with the fines im certain if i defrauded new york of 5k id get jail time and a lifetime ban from being able to run a business in new york im also sure his cult will be more than happy to pay of that fine
about time
thats cool if your gonna do this to trump keep that same energy with nancy poloaki shes fucked the stock market outta millions and not a single thing has happened martha stewart went to prison for the same shit poloski is doing why the double standard yall are fuckin special and need helmets super glued to your heads all this corruption is ridiculous and ruining a once great country our kids are screwed
his cult followers will pay it he doesnt have to worry theyre the same people who send their life savings to televangelists the dumbest people on the planet
these people are crazy
trump was found guilty of fraud and must pay a fine of 355 billion everyone knows that he is a greedy swindler
hahahahahaha why do people waste their time so president donald trump is appealing this case so its going to wind up in the supreme court and then throne straight into the garbage and president donald trump will be our 47 commander in chief by then what is wrong with the ignorant people that voted for the treasonous trailer benedict arnold joe biden they think they living in the twilight zone in another dimension what a bunch of ignorant people to believe anything
doj corruption that would make putin blush and strong arm embezzlement by the state of ny that the mafia would think heavy handed oh look at the democrats celebrate corruption good luck keeping businesses in your state lol better start collecting cans so you can pay for illegals to stay at the hilton guys
found liable for what hmmm paying his bills no one was harmed or slighted uh ha and letticia running for an ag of the judicial system shouting during election campaign she would get trump how is that for justice an ag who is supposed to be fair but only when she wants otherwise the system is multitiered it aint over ms letticia and you will be looking for work because you showed your envy hate prejudice and injustice those who think this is good are just hollywood telluswhattothinkandvision the mindless
cnn fox news are keeping people busy with their bs
what a crock of shit witch hunt no better than communist russia
dont worry he can still afford to wear that same suit he puts on everyday
theyre going to say were so tired of winning
hes going broke can you believe it
shocking and im canada
so hes gonna end up begging for money
i smell a bigly bankruptcy coming poor rudy definitely will not be getting paid remember when he told hillary hes smart stable genius strikes again
they are draining the swamp
cry maga traitors cry
the fight between warmonger greedy liberals and trump is intensifying they are on him from all directions and they are winning but when he gets the white house back in 2025 o boy everyone is waiting to witness it
that is going to be thrown out on appeal the judge is crooked as a bent stick
the judicial system is corrupt it is a shame justice for trump trump 2024 america stand with trump
hope don jr get vp then it would keep the trump name going
whos surprised the devil is busy all it does is make trump even stronger real americans see this demonic evil for what it truly is theyre not fooled at least the ones with a brain arent by these baseless corrupt witch hunts
this was nothing more than a kangaroo trial with the sole intention of bleeding him dry so that he cant run again for the presidency the american people are wise to cnns lies
dont worry he can afford to pay that fine with his new job hes getting in january
celebrate good times come on this makes me so happy
listen putin trump is not paying his bills
can the court also collect all the trades people he screwed money from
there was no fraud all banks were paid in full the dems are doing to trump the same thing that putin and other dictators do to their opposition
two tiered justice system
i cant believe they only gave him three years prohibition on doing business in ny and sons only 2
lol a bribed judge that needs prison
no exuspresident has ever had the phrases dirty deeds and illgotten gains used so often in conjunction with his name just call him dirty donald
i just want to sue for my tax money
the dems are doing to trump the same thing that putin and other dictators do to their opposition
what a joke what a waste of time and money the justice system knew like all the political lobbyist knew that nothing of significance would be done typical nothing new
live from saturday night
no surprise as the judge is bought
355 million is peanuts for donald trump he should have been barred banned and even disqualified from running for president
if you cant afford the fine dont do the crime
maybe nato will back him up or his new big mate the richest man in the world putin
a nice verdict against the trump crime family
so how much does the fraudulent judge get
i guess nobody here has ever refinanced a house its ok when it worked for you though huh lefty hypocrites this fine is absurd
america has officially become a banana republic there is no turning back when you weaponize the legal system to go against political opponents the tables will turn and the shoe will be on the other foot this is now acceptable and celebrated good luck coming back from this america
3 years ban from doing business 57 seems more reasonable
if god himself came down to earth and convicted trump his cult followers would try to burn down heaven
american democracy is in mortuary since uncle b took office then they want to teach the world democracy hypocrites
disgusting the radical left democrats globalists are trying to bankrupt him totally despicable i never listen to or watch cnn dont know why this is in my feed
is habba a dem plant djt may have hired her because shes easy on the eyes by lawyer standards but my goodness he has lost hundreds of millions of dollars behind the legal prowess of this nincompoop
biased judge should have been removed from bench oh its cnn a shit network
next uncle joe and his son
this is what winning winning by a lot winning so much you would be sick if it looks like
i dont care whos side politically your on if they do this to people like trump then we are screwed
this is unfortunate and shameful for the country were now playing the politics of a third world and communist state at large the issue is to keep trump off the ballot come next elections
the democrat communist party democrats are dangerous people
the gop can pay for trump
civil war is what democrats want and it looks like its coming soon but dont forget lets send 113 billion to ukraine
finally good news trump should have been arrested january 7th after insurrection
well then donny friends the saudi or vlad can keep paying his lawsuits till they are broke we got currently 7 running and 2 of them he is already paying 355 and 85 million well why go to war we can keep sueing trump till everybody gives up paying p come here russia cant we have gold too

so its true the president of russia is supporting these treasonous traitor benedict arnold joe biden president vladimir putin is the number one supporter of joe biden could you believe the ignorant people that voted for this treasonous trader joe biden theyre so ignorant they dont even understand whats going on
omg i cant stop laughing
send this commie judge to russia where he belongs
judge lloyd now rules judge chutkans previous ruling is now overruled and all sanctions against pres trump are hereby cancelled pounding gavel next see how easy
let me guess is this the first in american history or what
but he can start a biz anywhere else so its not a big dealgeez
good job when you make the amount of the penalty a laughably absurd number it makes it so much easier to establish the trial was not handled according to established standards and will therefore need to be replaced by an actual trial
have fun paying that off donald lol
he got off lightly engoron should have banned him permanently from doing business hopefully hell see the inside of a cell for the rest of his days for his other crimes and not have the chance to do business again anyway
we are in the western when the judges sent to the gallows because some was saying that the person was a criminal this administration and those who are acting in the shadows deserve the worst of justice well in a free country in a really democratic country usa is the shame of many countries in america and europe also in this moment is so low system that in many occasions i want to get out of here but the family is the situation in word i dont feel american and before i was very proud to say but today is it a shame
crap news network
all smiles at cnn tonight
having one judge decide this instead of a jury with the money at stake is bs
trump learn a valuable lesson take care of your people especial if they know where the bodies are buried
vivek ramaswamy for prez
the big orange fraud has to pay let him pay up in a big orange suit too
91 felony indictments 2 impeachmemts 1 fake university shutdown 2 fake charities shutdown 20 something sexual abuse charges its hard to keep track of the crime i recall when jimmy carter took office he voluntarily sold his peanut farm to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of intrest
im so sorry for the best president in history
they should make him pay for all legal fees
all of trumps lies are catching up to him next up retribution for all the lies about the 2020 election
that judge went back befor 2014 included that data he wasnt to do that why didnt the bank send out the 3rd party appraisal fuck that shit not trumps fault trump 2024 for sire now
dont forget the banks said trump never did what these dimwits said he did they were very happy with trumps dealing these dimwits
the trump org in ny is basically toast i wonder what will happen to all his garbage properties if theyll be put into administration or sold off the day they rip the letters off his 5th avenue property will almost be a state holiday thats for sure
now what will malania do no money in a divorce no money to stay with him lol
i would encourage russia to do whatever they want with him if he cant pay up
the most foolish thing about this is melania does not appear to have learned how to support herself and will burn through her money and be on the street with her husband hope barron inherited a brain as mary did
and oj wasnt guilty total corruption
its not about the money it about politics
donalds friend vlad will give him his loose change to cover that 355 million
bobo de mundo novo otan nato 2 there you go trumppert give that to nato just 5 cents appeal mr p
i have no faith in the america anymore anyone happy over this gonna be crying when biden destroys this country more
wow 2 gut blows in a row for trump yesterday it was terrible dictator putin today it was the honorable judge e
the worst communist embracing democrat judge in the history of this country
ya dont read it fully before you report on it in such a hurry to be first they dont care if they get the facts right
cnn and communist dc establishment flaunting their fraud and bias two tiered justice
from sweden oh happy day and more to come
judge igor is scary
he they got off easy
great verdict a fair fine hopefully it will put a stop to the trumps fraudulent ways at least in the state of ny
judge gives money to biden campaign and should have recused himself as judge
fined millions for being a braggert and a bullshittereven though nobodys ox got gored wierd statute
real estate fraud rich folks gaming the system is another reason the rent is too damn high
holy crap that judge did not hold back he got trump where it hurts him the most by stopping him taking out loans because he doesnt have any money
so maga cultist and russian trolls got any facts for your conspiracy theories cause 9 times being wrong and 1 times being right doesnt work very well in court of laws where facts matter not your opinion or lies that would be 9 lawsuits you have to pay 1 case you get paid p
trump is the most pathetic person in this country love hearing the courts and jurys finally giving him the karma that has been long coming and his arrogant pathetic sons to
we will party tonight
if the 70 million people thats gonna vote for trump pay 5 on his campaign website hell make that back over night or over the next 4 months nothing will stop trump from possibly winning if he goes to jail he can legally govern from jail also
dementia wars 4 and counting
i hope that people dont think that fraud is not a crime because if they do maybe they should do it and find out for themselves
ridiculous hes going to appeal
you gotta pay your bills traitor
made my day so he has to come up with around 600 million cash to pay off ny e jean carrol happy to see uday usay gotta come up with 4 milion each eric better get back to pouring concreteoh wait not in ny haha
i hope they get biden for his crimes too
354 million dollar judgment a real irs aduit will probably follow
this kind of crap is what convinced me to vote for trump now what a clown show he should easily appeal this one
not enuff trump is scum
if every maga supporter chips in a buck that would give tronald about a thousand bucks
these ding bats dont realise how corrupt their left liberal heros are they will pay and so will all america
just one more wining he is going bankrupt
what about that scum doing more fraudulent business
the billionaire who hides his tax returns the genius who hides his college grades the businessman who bankrupted 3 casinos and lost over 1b the playboy who pays for sex the christian who doesnt go to church the philanthropist who defrauds charity the patriot who dodged the draft the innocent man who pleaded the fifth 695 times the golfer who cheats at golf
drumphj the con is going down
and cnn is about to let all there viewers down again fanni is done and now engoron and laticia are next scotus will 100 overturn this
what bullshit
tired of winning trump
stephen king gave us pennywise dolt 45 gave us dollardumb same makeupsfx apparently
this judge should go to prison
you leave the comments that say nasty things about trump and you deleting the ones that is for trumpwhy cnn two face crooked animals
unbelievable what a financial mess scams lies fraudulent transactions has been harming him and his family
habba did a good job making sure there was no jury involved though yeah
how you like your investment now magas
you trump the mafia boss are not dealing with people that will sale their soul to the devil they are people out there that will protect america from gullibles like you trump
i think its crazy that they do not have enough evidence to hold you criminally liable for fraud but civil court can overrule that i dont know if its just me but i dont think that you should be able to even hold civil court without being found guilty in criminal court first this should terrify people politics aside
what do maga cultist and russian trolls have in common they both dont understand law suits it seems cause it isnt about lying or distracting it is all about facts
fani willis and cora bush are two women standing on business
hes a con man
does everyone realize that trump hired independent evaluators when valuating his assets so theyre holding trump liable for a valuation that a professional gave him thats insane
cnn fake news
even that what he did with stormy daniels with election interference before he was president but dont nobody want to mention that
nato has ruled trump must pay 355 million dollars
if you work for trump and lose your job then blame letitia james and the judge
that will go directly to the illegals
the judge needs to be jailed criminal democrats running our court systems all this is to try to keep him from running for president
i couldnt think of a more apt word to describe donald trump and his crimes fraud
and this is why he didnt show his taxes for presidency but the republicans let him get away with it in which was election interference which he always claiming and crying about
he is a billionaire according to him so this should be nothing
so vanky walks away scot freeshe musta spilled her guts
i hope da james takes some of that money and pays the small business contractors that trump routinely refuses to make good on after services are rendered
dems will go to any length to stay in power have their corrupt money look at the chaos hillary caused in the 2016 campaigns that lasted for years who will pay back the trump family for all the court fees and attorney fees that cost millions for hillarys russian hoax and pelosis jan 6th trials where trump was never charged with insurrection who will pay back taxpayers for hillarys fake russian hoax court costs and jan 6th costs democrats stripping trump of money to campaign wont stop him from winning in 2024 banks agreed with the value of trumps real estate maybe its the banks and appraisers they should be looking at trump will win 2024 election we see the corruption
watt r u talkin bout in the 80s time magazine said trump was not a 4 billionaire not even a billionaire they said he inflated all his properties like the trump logo was worth a billion dollars right
this judge is a fraud
now you pay your judgment and stop worrying about our nato allies paying
why are you deleting some comments that roast leticia e
trump i made taylor swift so much money she should pay this much for me
how come other people get prisonand he gets a fine
and the former presidents grifting contines
great news lock up the crooked sob
betcha trump now regrets being a career conman
who is going to get the money since there is no victim and there is no fraud
hey tv people please educate your interviewees about sound echoing and viewer enjoyment
sounds to me like new york its going to fall for sure now maybe trump should bring in a wrecking ball send more illegals
omg the treasonous con and supporters are pathetic
the biggest loser
dude doesnt even pay his own attorneys dude aint never going to pay this i bet he doesnt even have the money to pay it
yes poetic justice at last i would have changed it to a lifetime ban but i cant imagine any corporation wanting to do business with drump or company in 4 years theyd have to visit drump in a nursing home while he was taking one of his many dementia tests
every single property owner in ny should be very concerned right now ny and ca are clearly an anti business states businesses and commercial property owner should get out now while they still can its going to get ugly in ny
he shouldnt be able to serve as an office of the united states either
and people say there is no deep state what theyve done to this guy financially is unthinkable a good lesson to anyone who wants to run for president that really wants to shake up the status quo
wow trump as had his zionistsupporting nuts ripped offlol serves him right for being a crook
the biggest fraud in the history of the world i am sure he would make his daddy proud
well donald all you gotta do is ask your freeloading corrupt soninlaw jared kushner for a loan after all he did receive over 500 million of the covid relief money
on appeal this will be reversed and it will demonstrate why this man is not qualified to be a judge
this could rock the developer market you wonder when theyll hold the banks responsible for making the loans and the state for setting the tax bill
in the final analysis not a dime will be paid because this decision against trmp will be reversed
have you had enough of the lefts democracy yet how can a judge take trump to court for fraud
im lovin this finally this ghoul is getting just what he deserves when he was campaigning in first election he was bragging about how he did not pay taxes hes sure going to pay now we know damn well that he is using his campaign funds to pay his legal bills he put his daughterinlaw laura trump in as cochair for the rnc who handles the funds we know he uses campaign funds for his personal bills from the stormy daniels hush money scandal did he really think he was not going to draw attention to himself every middle class and under american citizen should be very offended by his words how anyone from the very beginning could not see through his bulshit is beyond me i say this often because i believe its relevant lbj was president when i was born we have never had such a classless person running our country i tried to tolerate him but the insurrection at the capitol was the last straw i look forward to watching all of his guilty verdicts and finally watching him be locked up
i hope the ag appeals to have all the trump companies shut down for excessive leniency
heres how smart trumps cultfollowers are they believed him when he began his political career by saying what set him apart from politicians was that he didnt need their money and theyve been giving him their money ever since
f cnn
can we cut to the chase such a zoo the ones whom runs our country is the elite the elite dont even pay any taxes
meanwhile in new york convicted murderers are being released on good behavior typical democrat state valuing money over life
black girl magic in the month of february taking down this narcissist dragon her accounting was so accurate impeccable
boy that ambulance chaser did a good job not now he can also be a deadbeat
just use your burner phone to record her snaps
oo donald dont be delinquent with us now gotta pay your bills donnie
cnn quality of reporting is so poor take your time to read ruling and report correct accurate information instead of this half baked news terrible glad to see drumpf found some accountability
pass the diapers walt
democrats pushing to be like putin on a day that putin killed his political rival
this is what 3rd world countries do to political opponents when they want to stay in power this is called law fare i cant stand demonrats
it looks like the bigtime businessman will need training wheels going forward for at least a while of course all of this is mute because the criminal cases are going to open up a whole different kind of issue to trump limitations on his freedom and remaining freedom time all of these are important for the next president so they understand to stay clear of specific issues called criminal activity clearly the lessons of nixon were not sufficient to deter trump
trumpers you better help your lord big mac pay this off
all these millions and hundreds of millions of dollars and the man has not paid no one one penny i dont think he would ever pay that but let all the ignorant people that voted for the treasonous traitor joe biden believe what they want they will believe anything you could sell them the brooklyn bridge and theyll buy it too thats how ignorant the people that voted for joe biden are you cant help ignorant they cant even help themselves they cant think out the box they master joe biden and this administration tell them how to thing because they have brain damage
biggest con man trump paid 750 dollars in multiple tax years
great trump have to pay
give elie jean hers first she needs a break
judge should do whatever the hell he wants to donald j trump
democrats are a joke worrying about democracy as they try to take down their political adversary through any means necessary putin is probably impressed
its about time trump needs to pay the only problem is he will use the peoples money that was donated to his presidents campaign these peoples hard earned money will be used for trumps legal problems it says trump cannot do business for 3 years
so much winning
this is a kangaroo court where the defendant cant defend themselves and thus decision will lose on appeal which it should our court system today is a disgrace
cnn communist news network
what a load of biden
what a genius business man add this to the long list of bankruptcies who is tired of all the winning phew
its 364 million
a real billionaire wouldnt sweat paying these fines what russian shell companies will come in and swoop up his tacky properties
james is a piece of work she needs to be in jail and disbarred pathetic and cant disappear fast of enough and the judge needs to be impeached and in jail
end of democracy erra in united states of america
the ny attorney general letitia james wanted big banks to make more money they by their own account vetted trump and did their homework they made profit on the deals they didnt complained if he hate trump this is the wrong way to attack him
still voting trump 2024 that judge had him guilty before he went to trial
its a witchhunt
this is the same judge that said trump was guilty before he saw any evidence this is how you know this is not a fair judgment twotiered justice system no different than the court system putin runs
they just keep playing with this guy and playing yall know damn well his team of legal beagles are just gonna litigate the hell out of this ok and hes never gonna pay a dime
trump could have avoid all of this by just being a decent human being this is a man who just can help himself he is a victim of his own personality sad
play stupid games win stupid prizes
the monitor needs to sell trump properties to pay ej carroll
fellas look i need 11780 votes and 354 million dollars i can afford the rest im the richliest eh person alive give me a break
this is a bought democrat judge trying to railroad trump and we all know it
headphone warning the best is yet to come
just wait until his lawyers start to sue for payment
well done new york
this judge is a diehard orthodox rayycisst against anglosaxons
soon he wont even be able to afford clean diapers
accountability time for the cult leadercriminal always a criminal
judges fbi cia and all corrupted organizations protect trumpwhy
never happening trumps team will appeal lets get a class action suit against the george soros tyranny crime family and sue for his fortune to give back to citizens
trump needs to sell every business he has in new york not to spend ant money in new york or pay anymore taxes in new york
hilarious to think this all snowballed because michael cohen ratted him out over questioning about his assets by aoc stormy daniels must be laughing her ass off
he is a career criminal and a traitor to the united states he is also an individual with absolutely zero redeeming human qualities clearly he is a threat to society and to everything this country stands for this monster must be locked up
thank god someone has finally held this idiot accountable
who is that money going to if theres no clear and obvious victim
cnn what a joke they have become there was a time when they were a respected news channel
rnc gives up their plan to continue paying legal bills for trump trump will not makes rnc great again trump made rnc goes bankrupt
i never realized how filthy our gov is until trump tried to clean it up voted dem all my life never again
just remember good triumphs evil trump 2024
another trump bankruptcy coming
but the guy that snitched on hunter got arrested gotta protect the crime family
he lost almost a halfbillion dollars in a matter of a few months he owes 355 million to the attorney general of new york and 83 million to e jean carroll those are the simple facts
yall should have read the order before going on the air with this
really shocking what has happened to this country never has a man been so deprived of his rights extremely scary well be next
clinton news network
and then it will be appealed and once again yall will lose as you do every time we all who are paying attention know how this goes by now and for those who dont buckle up cause it aint going to last where did this fraud come from anyway who or what businesses has made any complaints against trump bet you crazies cant answer that
how is it justice when the judge made his ruling clear prior to trial
they trying to do everything they can to break him i will pay 2000 a month
813 appellate pushback
this will set precedent to all companies willing to do business in new york this will either benefit the state or cause a mass exodus im hoping wall street pays attention to this their way of life or conducting business in this state will be over
theyre trying to break him btw i really deplore cnn and their smirky reporters or should one say talking heads they have no idea what true reporting is listen up im not a republican and im not in a cult peace
trump doesnt care he will let his supporters who think hes their saviour pay this fine as usual the guy is a big fat con man
its like these judges are trying to make trump go broke i swear
his crazy followers will pay it
this court is a joke they are woke and this all a personal vendetta
well thats disappointing that he didnt get the corporate death penalty but trump is never properly punished for his criminality sigh
we are witnessing america being turned into a corrupt communist country if they can do this to president trump they will do it to the american people wake up folks they want to rule over us this is election interference this is another form of opponent intimidation it is wrong the people vote not the politicianslove or hate president trump he is standing up to the vast corruption in washington those corrupt politicians will do anything to try and stop him from exposing them they care about themselves not the american people wake up before it is too late
be real people i live in new york city and this case is lik fake like the other case of the 81 million dollar you will have to be the most ignorant person in the usa not to see that all these cases are fake and when they wind up in the supreme court take a guess where theyre going let your imagination run wild like right now that the ignorant people that voted for that treasonous trader joe biden think theyre in an episode of twilight zone from another dimension what a bunch of ignoramus
now bragg starts ha ha ha fani willis just scared them off the dems are taking seats the biden corruption scam has been shown to be based on a complete lie karma is a bitch donaldo mcdonaldo
trump is not gatesbezos he doesnt have 355 million idiots unless montelogo fl is worth what he said it was the irony
so maybe a little sidelight is that when you hire lawyers you might look for the ones who are really smart not fake smart
he looks so happy what a pice of he is
yeah make trump pay they stold from americans trump families very sick an corub
definitely unbiased btw
hey trumpyou are a loser
to catch up trump cannot operate a charity because he defrauded children with cancer he liable for sexual assault and also defamation he committed fraud with his business and can now no longer operate a business in new york for a time he will likely soon be convicted on at least some of his 31 criminal counts where he paid off a porn star whom he was cheating on his wife with while she was taking care of their new born son but you knowhes three years younger than biden edit and yeah just to be clear this is before all his insurrection felonies come to trial
cnn needs trump and everyone knows it
what bull
i told him to be nice otherwise he would get no vaseline lol
end socialism today
so much winning
ha ha ha i just hope that they make him pay every penny of that lawsuit
just like his slumlord father fred who was blackballed from doing business in nyc and his grandfather before him who was kicked out of the country for running rinkey dink scams dopey donald once again demonstrates that he thinks special rules apply to him just because hes an entitled 2nd generation immigrant who won the lottery people get annoyed when you rip them off and nonstop make mouth noises that have nothing to do with reality donaldthecheckdodger and his empire of scams folding like a house of cardshe could have had a nice comfortable american dream life if he wasnt so greedy
i hope all these people intend on moving out of the country when will the bidens be held accountable for robbing every single american citizen
why would anyone ever wanna do business in new york again this impacts the working class the most by taking jobs away
the state should appeal the ruling of a 3 year prohibition and go for a ruling of the trump organization or any entity with trump or his children forbidden to do business in new york for ever
no panic supreme court will shut this media clownish case down just wait and see
meanwhile biden no crime here says the media no this is what putin does got that
i feel warm and tingly all over and i bet iam not the only one
just like teflon he wont have to do a thing nor will anything happen to him how many has be been found guilty and yet here we are talking about another trial that found him guilty if this was the trial of an ordinary 9to5 meat and potato type of guy rest assured he would have been locked up a long time ago your country is doomed
guess ny needs more money for there migrate problems by hitting up the trump family whats next taking over his hotels
what a corrupt judicial system this is election interference
still not tired wining if this pattern continues tre45on will be negative billionaire by next year
great
weve got the greatest fines never before in the history of the world has there been fines this big us maga clowns are doing it bigly
this could not have happened to a more deserved person this is great news
thats a nice day for america
justification for a military takeover
he is still polling 8 points above sleepy joe
no victim no crime this whole thing is a sick and perversion of the law all of you should be ashamed of yourself acting this justified and legit
trump claim hes a billionaire its a drop in the bucket for him
look at the king with his fine invisible clothes he can dance into prison with his invisible clothes
fines are not enough that psychopath needs to watch the next elections in an orange jump suit behind bars and the next elections and the next
way baiden son and his father dont pay everything they stole
witch hunt biden owes the us 100x more trump 2024
trying really hard to prevent another trump presidency
the length you the democrats have gone to just destroy trump using the government institution and power is mind blowing i can say you dont hate him rather you are scared and terrified of him if it was him going for biden and his son hunter you cnn and rest of democrats would have said trump is the dangers to democracy the irony
so how does that work if i scam families to invest in fraud its a crime only if everything works out what i am sure many in jail will give objects or money back for no crime
id hate to be donnies nearest ketchup bottle
judge sucks
he ruled trump guilty before the trial began
time to pay up donald pay your bills theres another 3 word mantra for ya
trump just hit two records in history of voting for two different swing states
no wonder he was thanking melania for her loyalty just a few days agomelania if you stay until the end you may only get his dirty underwear
so he bragged he was smart for not paying any taxes traitor good riddance
cnn and all their hogwash liberal democraps
liable for what no crime was committed this is such bull shit dont you think the banks would know value the banks never said they were defrauded this is total weaponization of the justice system and the bs media just pukes the bull shit out
judge should use some of that cash to get a less creepy mugyikes
why cant we just lock dementia don the fake ex president fn up
if donald needs a place to stayi have a cabin in northern canadano electricity or running water but it has a woodstove that he will like if he enjoys chopping wood
appeal
hamper his ability to be nimble nimble that is an extremely polite way of describing trumps fraud antics
trump is killing you with tds hey hoard toilet paper sheople
this judge is corrupt the ruling will ruin new york businesses are leaving trump willnot pay he will appeal this judge ruling will be reaversed by a appealit court
disbar the judge what a pile she should pay him for all the pr history of lawsuits against men
damm they want my nigga trump out of here but its fake news just a distraction so people can forget about biden until he gets replaced
trump is done you trump bootlickers and loyalists can keep living on planet maga if you want to but trump did this to himself and it was 77 years in the making maga is not the majority and a guy who cant even be trusted to run a business sure as hell shouldnt be trusted to run the most powerful country in the world making trump president again would be like putting bernie madoff over the federal reserve
this is bullshit
fucked around found out plain and simple
jarhead would regard 350 million washingtons as chump change now thats what i call irony so surely greedy headonastick barbie yep mrs jarhead will help daddy expensiveist out for a nominal fee say 300m
corrupt justice department and corrupt media it is hard waiting on all the mindless sheep to see it you all will soon see who is fighting for you and who is getting paid to do what they are told at your demise
if it happend to trump it will surely happen to any person regardless how much money you have america wake up to what is going on
this is the death penalty for the gump corp cuz his socalled business has always been nothing but the equivalent of a giant check kitingponzi scheme he throws a bunch of money into poorly managed projects that can never reclaim the investment so he offsets part of that by not paying the bills when they come due then he lies to insurance companies to keep that expense low while also lying to tax authorities to keep that liability fraudulently low all while then grossly inflating property values to lenders in order to get better terms and to borrow against equity that does not exist the way he kept all of the plates spinning was to keep churning more and new scams using borrowed monies from one to keep making payments on the others until he could get a new scam up and running then add in the wonders of money laundering opportunities that his projects in panama eastern europe presented to say nothing of the illegal enrichment from the middle east china while potus and the millions just rolled in just in the nick of time since he was already on the verge of going bust and being indicted just before resorting to a run for potus he just ran out of time and now when forced to work under the law with administrative compliance looking at everything it presents a way of doing business that gump has literally never experienced the simple fact is that he somehow managed to fail completely in the past even with all of his illegal advantages and ignoring of the law so the odds of him being able to do it all legally for the first time in his life are less than zero oh and lets not forget that hes gotta cough up a half a billion dollars so far just as a starting point for this brand new world to him his watching them all fail again and again while we wait for them to go to jail is the payoff for having had to tolerate these scumbags being allowed to live among us all if these years cant wait to see them all die broke exposed and alone
come on maga step up to the plate and save the billionaire hahaha way to go stable genius hahaha oh man what a goof if your on the orange balloons pay roll i feel for ya ya no i dont
theyre really scared of donald trump arent they theyre throwing everything at him trying to take him down
he is getting hammered for his actions
hes not going to pay something he doesnt have
absolute corruption and the basement dwelling fan boys cheering for communism
but yet people want him to be our president again lets wake up if we dont pay our bills we get fried biden is not for us and neither is trump biden has placed a big burden with all the illegals and crimes rising up not to forget all money given to illegals when the us needs much help then we have trump and son and whoever else committed fraud and other crooked things is exhausting
bullsh1t there will be a real insurrection if this bullshit keeps happening and i dont give a fuck who knows
bunch of s h it engoran was either compromised by physical treats or some kind of monitory bribe what about the original ruling of removing licenses of trumps in nyc why was this not reinstated
its cnnill go to fox news for the truth
the corrupt democrats have hurt the state of ny and the country with their election interference americans are watching all of these charges to trump while the truly guilty biden sleeps his way to the white house the media isnt covering this whole story fairly which hurts our kids future start doing your jobs
former donald j trump frauded the united states treasury legacy to treasury direct t bills t bonds and tips
im loving it
dondons a billionaire right pocket change
i would have never thought in a million years some of the people i know who who are going to vote for trump lawfair is not working what is strategy b
this means nothing because trump will appeal
this will all be stopped due to the appeal
id rather he be banned from running for any public office ever again
trump was never a good business man just a fraud
trump mob activity finally exposed
oh lara trump will have to raise the 4 million dollars to pay erics fine first before she starts raising funds if she gets elected as co chair of the rnc for which she said every penny raised will go to her father in law donald trump what a joke
yeah you care when he commits fraud but no other politician or government entities lmao clown show
so cannot trump cheats on his accounting and fraud but his mental old age stability should be heavily considered he wears diapers for heavens sake
lefties are easily played
these journalists are intentionally ignoring the fact that trump can and will appeal long before paying any money im an attorney i highly doubt that his appeal will be denied youll be voting for president before this is over and frankly this doesnt hurt trumps reputation because most people who support trump believe the court system is corrupt and being weaponized against him
this is being celebrated by people who have made fortunes off of insider trading
i believe that judge moron is lifting money from president trump him and miss james but i think that president trump should pack up every business he got and move to another location and then turn right around and sue the hell out of judge moron but none of this would have ever happened if it wasnt for twisted cnn msnbc abc the view and some celebrities this dam judge has broken the law so i think that judge moron should be removed from the courtroom period and never served as a judge again and when are they going to get him for showing his body on social media thats a crime as well
this case makes zero sense i dont like you so ill charge you with something that ive never charged anyone else and find you guilty no matter what you do democrat logic spells the utter destruction of the us
the trumps didnt do anything wrong this judge is a fool the banks will always go lower than you give them
after many yrs of lying and cheating judgement is finally here for trump and his family business insider called them family criminal enterprise you will see they are going right back to beg for donations even though trump said he is a rich man with a lot of cash
evil leftardsif the banks say they recouped and wanted to continue business with him how is it fraud it isntevil leftardstrump 2024
pay up citizen you know he is breaking shit
hahahaha whatever chump change next pathetic they talk about this like its a real situation
new york is going bankrupt and have to pay for those illegal aliens some wayfny fjb and fengeron
he will wiggle around a director of compliance
this idiotic judge is so stupid and corrupt our justice department is as bad as the one in north korea
a corrupt liberal judge who hates trump what a big surprise the total disgusting weaponization of the justice system
he will never pay a dime he will win on appeal he should sue the state of new york for 10 billion in discrimination unless they are going after every developer in the state of new york
if trump didnt screw michael cohen over stormy daniels then this trial would likely never have happened next up is that stormy daniels hush money falsifying business records commiting campaign finance violations and election interference case which could bring jail time
you can tell that judge was 110 bias what freaking garbage
justice is served partiallylots of cases left to go but this was a good start
good luck getting trump to pay this
wish he received a trial since they skipped it and went to penalty phase lenders agreed with trumps valuation they did there own
you know what they say about ignorant fools that believe in the kangaroo court or these fake cases right youll find out soon enough dont laugh too much youre going to be crying over the river later on when the supreme court just shut it down and throws it in the garbage
which one of his crimes was this fine for
i pay my respects to letitia james a real good job
the irony of navalny dying while trump is persecuted in such a similar way on the exact same day is striking
this guys that make him guilty they are 100 time worst they should pay billion and more
there goes the severance
trial awas a sham
when trump is re elected he will pardon all of this on a fed level lol this is all for show
good luck getting trump to pay this
vicious political and unprecedented i dont like trump but this was a purely political case prosecuted by a political party as much as i dislike trump i now dislike democrats even more and i was one for 30 years we are divorced now and it is unreconcilable
the daughter didnt have to paywell her hubby got 23 billion from the saudis smh
oh id love to be a fly on the wall right now at mar a lago tee hee
maga botsorcs are going mental in the commentshahaha suck it suckers
msnbc cnn have worked to do
corrupt judge and asinine outcome as expected
president biden is a disgrace an insult to our country east palestino ohio today is just one what about maui what about homeless migrants taking over
thats 500 each from all of his supporters 16 pack or 1pack of cigarettes
clearly a very biased judge designed to bankrupt trump so that he cant be president again
they wont get a dime
trump will be fine hes trump just another obstacle hell get over
the ruling of a non case case the fraud is the prosecutor and the attorney general oh trump send nyc a bill for the ice rink you saved
how about the other people who pah their taxes while he cheats to not pay what he owes thus there is a victim the other taxpayers
shouldnt pay anything this is a set up
our political system broken our judicial system broken
the witchhunt continues what makes this funnier is that he would still beat biden if there was an election today get a new candidate please
trump will win gonna be appealed communist news nazis
corrupt pedophile judge should be in prison not presiding over any cases this corrupt decision will be overturned in an appeal
i the big apple for this judgement
great now they have to find the people he defrauded to dole out the fine to
going to appeals gonna be reversed
this will be overturned on appeal thats the truth
corrupt judge there is no victim who gets the money this is a political hit job
its only money hell biden gives it away like giving candy to little girls at a pajama party
these twinks will never stop crying about trump
people of new york should point the finger at themselves when more businesses start leaving that state they voted for these corrupt people
trump stop whining and take another l
dumpy trumpy pay up we know you prefer to skip out on bills not anymore
i am a disciple of the almighty magnificent and great maga king trump2024
the king is naked
3 years 42 days after smelly stupids insurrection lets hope stupid finally receives a 22year proud boy sentence stupid fined 355m fine with interest for fraud after also being prosecuted 5m for rape and 833m for having a big mouth only in america the land of the school shootings would a pathological liar with 91 charges against him still be eligible to be president again
there is no victim only a corrupt soros dictatorship us is a banana republic
should have prohibited his family or any business controlled by his family from doing business in the state of new york in perpetuity
finally we can use the laws in our favor enough with his false claims
they are trying so hard to bring him down so he doesnt become the next president they are so afraid if he becomes president jokes on them their fear is regardless of trump for all the crimes they have committed in office they will pay
praise my god not trumps god
that evil judge better watch his back
he can pay it no big deal and im voting for him 100 still trump2024
this is so bs those lenders have their own a appraiser and what are these people talking
idiot finally visits east palestine ohio cnntrump trump trumplol
if trump wins the presidencyo lot of people going to fall of their balcony and som will end up with shady dead we call it in holland bijltjes dag if i was the judgei would leave the usa after the exit polls
trump wins big very smart man
the judge in this case in guilty of gross misconduct because he was openly biased against the defendant and pronounced judgement prior to any evidence being presented to the court this judge should have recused himself from the case because of his bias and should face disbarment as a result of this gross insult to our legal system
this is not a big loss for trump the gqp will gleefully pay this and any other fine sanction etc daily reminder republicans every donation you make to your gqp is a direct payment to e jean carroll have a lovely day
hey maybe some new windparks opening soon
first theres no way this stands on appeal its an absolute joke 355m for supposedly lying about the value of a property when even the banks that loaned him the money said he did not and they always do their own independent appraisals no jusry decided guilt before it even starts what a joke nyc sure knows how to drive profitable tax payers out of their city second their are a lot of moms basement legal scholars on here that have no clue about how much an abuse of power this is using the courts to prosecute your political enemies hope you enjoy it when the other party does it to you soon
looks like he has to call vladolf putler for some cash
this just proves the investigation in all of this has been going on for years and now after his presidential bs just added to the case hes a has been finally
i would tell russia to do whatever the hell they want with you you gotta pay your bills haha jokes on you genius
be ready maga karens here come the new worthless nfts and donation requests from televangelist donald skunk
thanks democrats you fools are just paving the way to his re election lol
i cant laugh anymore the ignorant of the people that voted for the treasonous trader joe biden do not understand this is going to go to the supreme court it going to be shut down but let them know they little damage brain they have nothing in there i have to laugh about this cuz theyre so ignorant that they actually believe this is going to go anywhere
he will for sure get elected now what a bunch of idiots
you guys will help pay this soon cnn just hold on
wonderful day for joe putin go joe putin go
the fraudster is guilty
i bet that judge that ordered that will no longer be a judge in the near future just wait karma always comes back around and the truth always comes out
cnn is grinning so hard their ears are wet wait till november i bet they will be singing a different tune
they cant contain themselves im certain they are all sitting in their own piss
hey cnn 133 days have passed since 6 american hostages have been held in gaza by hamas and this is what you prioritize shameful
dems now that we couldnt stop him and he is winnig lets drain his bank account because he wants to drain our swamp oh no wait he can make 10 million a day just by fundraising why people love trump and hate us
this judge is a total bonkers trumphater who needs to be disbarred and kicked to the curb where he belongs
if trump doesnt have the now is the time for the rnc to tell him to eff off
oh please theyll never get a penny this is a nothingburger
i dont care about any of this crap getting thrown at trumpim voting for him again he has the balls to fix whats broken in the usaespecially the crap thats going on at the border and the freshly booted dhs secretary alejandro n mayorkas
doesnt he have to pay interest on that money
hopefully on appeal they will raise that amount and make it a lifetime ban on any trump business in ny
witch huntmrtrump go get the dam bastardsthey will screw up one day tooand karma will bite them in the buttnever quit and never give upgod bless you mrtrump
not a single person believes any of this stuff in nyc everyone can tell how everything has been set up its funny the more the left trys to sink him the more people like him heck im a democrat and im gonna vote for him trump 2024 yall have gone crazy we wont make it with progressive control and ideas the last 3 years have been horrible brandon would mess up a wet dream id rather listen to a mean tweet and have cheaper gas and groceries and secure borderskick rocks joe and harris
this judge was very bias against trump
what a joke of a net work they tell you what to say puppets
i bet all the businesses 45 has not paid over decades are doing a happy dance
yet the real criminals the bidens who leave cocaine in white house still walking tall with no consequences with their criminal family smdh
who does he pay it to there isnt even a plaintiff in this case this is a judges and ag conspiring to commit election interference and brainwashed morons are lapping it up like they got a prize can you people really not see what this is
who is supposed to pay if nobody was harmed stupidity
law and order
what a crock the democrats let real criminals loose like the scum bags that beat up the 2 police officers
can you feel the bern
there are no victims fk the left in 2024
judging by their thumbnail photos the judge looks like hed been forced to pay it what a dusty old coot
trump is never worry mega will pay for him
this isnt a win for commie james thank god we have a supreme court to take care of fools like this judge
this judge is clearly biased
now the new york attorney general must go after all the other real estate investors that have paid back their loans in full
give him 3 months to come up with the money in addition the payment for his fraud case another 3 million he will stall until he dies if there is no due by date
cnn when will you be honest
wait the judge that declared trump was guilty way before the trial even began just decided trump was guilty no way i never saw that coming i bet theres no way trump will appeal
he wont pay this nonsense this whole trial was a sham
in a civil trial doesnt there have damages who was damaged
his loyal cult will pay his bill
my ass you should be elated cnn even though you know its bogus
wheres the crime when there isnt a victim all loans were paid back no banks brought charges pretty ridiculous left wing judges are playing politics
trump just for murdered financially
judge is a partisan hack he should be removed
your all suffering from a severe case of tds and its hysterical the judge found him guilty before the trial without hearing any evidence apparently hes the amazing kreskin there were no complainants who lost anything and everyone made money the attorney general said she was going to harass him and be a pain in the ass if she had said that about a briben or anyone else tds patients would loose their collective minds
wow i heard there was a high level of coolaid drinkers but reading the posts that comment on cnn posts confirms it
trump 2024 lets go the deep state strikes again we are going to take back america
thats never going to happen
he will appeal this but money is nothing to him
so trumps lies has cost him and his supporters 1 billion dollars
trump is rich he78 years old he have money to pay his billes rest his life ahahahah
bet he wont pay a dime
thats alot of steak
karma finally arrived
isnt the victim the entire city and state of ny wouldnt that mean he hasnt been paying his federal taxes right either wouldnt that mean the entire country is the victim
they are doing everything they can to keep this man from winning the 2024 elections
dems are so crooked they are terrified of trump because he exposed them for what they are
crooked azz judge time for the soon to be trump fbi to lock the judge up and the da up
them chickens just keep coming home to roost lets hope this trend continues in his criminal cases i hope this breaks him he is not as rich as he claims to be
wow does the rnc even have that kind of money
see hes not going to jail thats like 50 bucks in wallet and he will stall in moneys nothing when you got money its a joke
dont you people have literally anything else to talk about wasnt there another trans mass shooter that none of you cowards are talking about what is it now like the fifth or sixth one in the last several months
they do need a monitor their cfo said he did not know generally accepted accounting principles neither did his nepobosses
dont throw your lawyer under the bus
attorney alina habbayour fired
you guys are pathetic
poor americans when they realize they are next how dare he pay back the loans in full how evil
so much winning donald
mar a largo for sale pristine condition twice as big as you might guess hidden secret documents nice view pure air price just 500 billion dollars good price greetings donald your orange jesus
i find it a bit too convenient that that russian guy accidentally died in essentially the same news cycle trump is found guilty of fraud makes me wonder if russia spied on things and found a time to kill the guy and it get buried by other breaking news
so much winning he must be getting tired of winning
justice for ejean carroll justice for new york justice for america
the judge paid to play go trump 2024 then they all fall down oh yeah its coming cant wait
admittedly im kind of giddy at the thought of trumps crazypatrotic supporters many being military active retired teaching a class on retribution ha ha ha ha ha
amazing how these judges can still hold office embarrassing the fact that the media is also complacent in this dire lección of justice is sad
so there saying capitalism is against the law what a sham
when is the trial for tax evasion going to start high value for loans low values for property taxes
this is a national disgrace you dont go after your political opponents in this manner
dont care still voting for him
thank you judge engoron he disrespected you and your office
its time this judge is investigated and i repeal it and move my business out of new yorkjust think how many american going to be out of a job
but hes going to make his maga people pay for it
appeal this fraud
fing stupid judge i have never had a real estate loan where the bank didnt have an independent appraiser appraise the property they are doing everything they can to destroy this man you are blind if you dont see it
all you supporters of t should sell your homes cars and retirement fundswhatever you have to save him dont worry when he gets back in power hell find you and pay everybody back just trust people just trust him
former presidant donald j trump frauded the treasury direct protected securities tips t bills bond i bonds ee sensitive information

everybody sing start spreadin the news trumps leavin today at least for three years unless hes in jail and we all will be a part of it new york new york trumps soontobe vagabond shoes are being told to amscray right out of the very heart of it new york new york
fanni fay is a liar

if he has to pay that much how much do you think we can get pfizermaderna to pay for their faulty vaccine
this is bullshit trump 2024 now more then ever wake up people
who does he owe the money too when apparently none of the banks were hurt by the loans
what miss carriage of justice it is a sham
isnt 355 million just a fraction of the billions in bribes that the saudis paid to jared kushner and the rest of the trump family
so if you or i commit some small fraud lying about say a few thousand dollars it would be jail time trump committed fraud to the tune of millions for decades and gets a monetary penalty a slap on the wrist basically a tax on the profits they made this should not have been a civil case it was 100 criminal imo also its only for a few years he lied for decades and they just say dont do it again for a few years and youre good this is nothing but an inconvenience to him he will make more money from the cult just by crying and saying ny is picking on him

rosie odonnels laughing from the other side
he was a fraud since the great decade of the 80s and we have to come to a realization with the relationship of the people and politicians well most of them that is when it comes to people like fp trump people will still support this guy no matter what humanity is drawn more to a crooked leader than a honest leader that was proven and proof that we are at the point of no return with the bout between trump and clinton both had a laundry list of bad behaviors and for some reason we were drawn to them so rather if you are a dedicated voter or not no one have a right to complain about the person sitting in the oval office because somehow they were placed in there either by the people or by the people who so call represents the people
wheres the crime overturned on appeal its ny what did you expect
the more the government railroads trump the more we the people will vote for trump in 2024

a judge has ordered ex president donald trump and his companies to pay 355 million in a ruling in the new york civil fraud case the former president is also barred from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years lol rotflmao so sweet so good just keep piling on more and more stress and anger on this clown and maybe well be rid of him before november too ex president donald trump and the trump organization must pay 354 million in fines a judge ruled friday issuing his longawaited judgment in the states civil fraud case the decision also bars them from seeking loans from financial institutions in new york for a period of three years and includes a threeyear ban on trump serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation judge arthur engoron handed down his judgment in a 92page decision on friday the ruling is one of the largest corporate sanctions in new york history the judges decision also blocks allen weisselberg the former chief financial officer of the trump organization and jeffrey mcconney former corporate controller from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years and permanently bans them from serving in the financial control function of any new york corporation the evidence is overwhelming that allen weisselberg and jeffrey mcconney cannot be entrusted with controlling the finances of any business engorons order states in addition to imposing limits on trumps business activities the order bans his two oldest sons eric trump and donald trump jr from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or legal entity for two years the two who serve as executive vice presidents at the trump organization must also pay more than 4 million apiece including interest weisselberg is ordered to pay a 1 million penalty engoron issued a scathing rebuke of trump his two adult sons weisselberg and mcconney in his decision writing that they refused to admit error even after four years of investigation and litigation their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological he wrote they are accused only of inflating asset values to make more money the documents prove this over and over again if the attorney general is permitted to retroactively insert herself into private commercial transactions between sophisticated parties no business transaction entered into in the state of new york will be beyond the attorney generals purview the spokesperson said every member of the new york business community no matter the industry should be gravely concerned with this gross overreach and brazen attempt by the attorney general to exert limitless power where no private or public harm has been established new york attorney general letitia james brought the civil suit in 2022 asked the judge to bar trump from doing business in the state and sought a penalty of 250 million a figure her office increased to 370 million by the end of the trial trump the trump organization and several executives including his two eldest sons donald jr and eric trump were named as codefendants in the suit even before fridays ruling the judge had largely affirmed james allegations that trump and others at his company inflated valuations of his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a decade and misrepresented his wealth by billions the scheme the state said was meant to trick banks and insurers into offering more favorable deal terms engoron ruled in september that trump and the other defendants were liable for fraud based on the evidence presented through pretrial filings the trial which began in october and wrapped up in january focused on other aspects of the lawsuit related to alleged falsification of business records issuing false financial statements insurance fraud and conspiracy the financial penalty james sought known as disgorgement is meant to claw back the amount trump and his company benefited from the scheme under new york law disgorgement cases are decided by a judge not a jury the lawsuit laid out seven causes of actions the claims of illegal conduct that james office said entitled the state to claw back illgotten profits and warranted severe sanctions against the defendants persistent and repeated fraud falsifying business records conspiracy to falsify business records issuing false financial statements conspiracy to falsify false financial statements insurance fraud conspiracy to commit insurance fraud the claims revolve around financial statements given by trump and his company to banks and insurers the statements were prepared by accounting firms using spreadsheets of underlying data that included vast inflations of trump property valuations the defendants lost on the first claim persistent and repeated fraud before the trial even started the sept 26 fraud ruling engoron agreed in september with james office that it was beyond dispute based on evidence presented through pretrial filings that trump and his company provided banks with financial statements that misrepresented his wealth by billions the documents here clearly contain fraudulent valuations that defendants used in business engoron wrote in the sept 26 ruling engoron found as fact in that ruling that trump and the company overstated the valuations of many properties by hundreds of millions of dollars he cited the palm beach assessor valuation of trumps maralago club at between 18 million and 28 million for each year between 2011 and 2021 the values for which he paid local property taxes during those years trump valued the property at between 328 million and 714 million on his annual statements of financial conditions ivanka trump and her brothers said they couldnt recall many of the interactions at the center of the case including deliberations related to efforts to secure financing and insurance for trump property developments eric and donald trump jr both sought to pin blame on the companys accountants claiming they had little involvement in the preparation of financial statements that misrepresented the values of company properties but engoron determined that there was sufficient evidence that eric and donald trump jr intentionally falsified business records he found that eric trump intentionally gave mcconney knowingly false and inflated valuations for the seven springs estate a trumpowned property in westchester county new york the former president took the stand on nov 6 stopping to address the media on his way into court its a very sad situation for our country he said under oath he gave longwinded answers seeming to test the judges patience at one point engoron addressed trumps lawyers saying we got another speech and urging them to control him if you can as questioning continued trump defended the valuations of various trump organization properties said the companys statements of financial condition included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies engorons order criticized trump for failing to answer many questions which the judge said damaged his credibility overall donald trump rarely responded to the questions asked and he frequently interjected long irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial his refusal to answer the questions directly or in some cases at all severely compromised his credibility ivanka trump the former presidents daughter and once an executive at the trump organization was originally named as a defendant in the suit but an appellate court later dismissed allegations against her citing the states statute of limitations
this judge is a idiot
the banks approved the loans the loans were paid back sometimes early who the hell was the defrauded party here this is nothing more than a witchhunt if i were trumps attorney id appeal
since trump doesnt pay his bills it looks like hes going to be invaded lol
that judge seems to have mental issues
his dirtpoor cultists will be happy to pay the bill for him all the wealthy people he gave tax cuts to will just flip him off and laugh
ttump loans himself 50m says he doesnt need receipts miss willis paid 250000 dutch with cash but they need receipts
responsibility matters for all lives usa
trump will begging the american people hard billionaire begging
for going against the corrupted regime
to compensate the victims who were paid back in full and said they suffered no damage this is a freaking travesty and hopefully an appeals court will actually apply the law everyone here that thinks its a good thing to abuse the justice system to attack political opponents dont want a functioning democracy its the beginning of the end enjoy
this will for sure get him elected
probably putin will pay for him
wtf that is do unfair the judge had already judged him to be guilty this is so crooked take it to the appeals court
this will go to a higher court and new york will lose businesses
weird how all these law suits in democratic favored areas by democrat appointed judges all for political persecution
well for a fact this lunatic criminal satan will not pay this with his own money or if will ever pay any money from his donor or sponsor will do another delay delay his words of course we are delaying is obviously i am running for president again but will definitely will try an appeal this a win for new york but also a lost cause this money will not be paid
ill bet hell refuse to pay his lawyers for losing the case
you dont pay don i encourage them to do whatever the hell they want
nothing to see here move along what about hillarys emails
imagine going to your bank and getting a loan the banker asks you for your collateral you offer up whatever you have to secure the loan the banks accepts the collateral against the loan you repay the loan in full are you expecting your local da to come after you years later to claim that you overvalued the collateral
life long criminal now is the time to pay
or judicial system is sit trump should have got a life sentence at least a minimum of 20 yearstrump always gets special treatment hillary never got this special treatment when are they going to fix this maybe biden can get some special treatment
who gets the money when i got a home equity line of credit they decided how much to loan me they compare other similar properties and come up with a number they are comfortable with not sure who were the victims here
responsibility matters for all lives usa
democrats run from democracy like cowards
this is pure bullshit period
wow its a great day party time
by the way cnn is fake news democrat propaganda
yall making jokes but this was a terrible terrible ruling if you were in trumps situation youd feel like you never had a fair chance for something thats been terribly adjudicated the bank agreed to the evaluation period the government cannot arbitrary determine the value of a private deal
president trump is the next president so thier trying to dry him up of money but hes winning in 4 out of 5 swing states so before you crazy liberals attack me the polls are from liberal outlets sooooo yeaaaa its over
two tier justice system at its finest
this is total bs the banks say everything was perfect how can one dirty democrat judge bankrupt you kangaroo court
the irs or nys tax authority should be the next logical step living like a big shot off of daddys back taxpayers and all the carpenters tile workers and laborers he beat by hiding behind crooked lawyers like roy cohn hopefully has finally caught up
this is great news hes held accountable
trump keeps winning hell need more donations his next rally will be him whining about how unfairly hes being treated
its just a way for pos kcalb people to get reparations frraudulently from trump
if trump was reelected he would have the longest secret service detail in modern history sounds like a conflict of interest
so who does this money go to
not enough should have been 500 million just to be sure donald trump is a scumbag and thinks that hes innocent of everything that this is a witch hunt no donald its not a witch hunt youre a scummy person that tries to always find a way around things you always try to play around the system that most people would be in jail by now and youre walking free i dont care if youre running for president because he can give you special treatment you dont deserve it maybe now youll feel but the 380 families that lost their entire savings in the taj mahal casino and you walked out smelling clean maybe now youll feel something i doubt it but those families lost their entire wealth because of you
the victims are the banks and insurance cos that got screwed out of profits the victims are the people of ny whos taxes had to offset what irs and citystate didnt get to put towards the cost of services places like chump tower benefit from the victim is the economy of ny which like everywhere else on earth relies on money changing hands cnn reporting fake news as usual by suggesting there were no victims give your head or pimple a shake
companies have tax breaks for irs tax ŕeturns
everyone has high energy on set today and we love to see it
total garbage new york should be ashamed who is the victim wtf justify my ass the fact that you arent picking this apart just backs trump youre fake news
hey ben does the 364m include compound interest
the real joke about the democrats is that even if he just gave all this money they would still bash him afterwards he could perform miracles and you lunatics would still talk s on him the tds is infinite
putin has nothing on biden talk about politically wrong cant wait for the worm to turn as they say
oh hell yeah
this nation is so wicked i guess most people would rather have joe biden 4 more years of him and the nation will not be a nation anymore
fake asshole news
what everyone keeps ignoring is that its not only the banks who were defrauded the taxpayers were both in new york and the rest of the country 1 by reducing the valuation of the properties for tax purposes he paid lower property tax to the localities 2 by inflating the valuations for loans he reduced the profits of the banks which is where the 370m came from and that reduced the taxes that the banks paid to the city state and federal governments you and i paid for these tax shortfalls out of our own pockets
sell out everything in new york all the rich people and the business if they are going to do this is to him they will do it to you
his daughter in law should not get the job she has no qualifications
so some clown judge one guy can order another guy to pay 355 million dollars everyone should be wary of this if they can do this to a past president what if they came after you

thankyou judge engoron

dont believe the trump family will pay anything if in paper money to the state of new york most people have forgotten that when trump was usa president he had his own private ag justice department defense department irs treasury department etc believe the trump family took a lot of fake printed money from the treasury department will use that to pay what they must pay believe the fake money will pass the public but not the treasury department so believe the trump family will be back in new york soon no big deal
rigged before it started at least we know the bad players now
im very happy with this ruling because of people like trump the rest of us have to pay more for everything we the ones who pay more taxes for these guys to pay 750 to the irs in one year but what i really want to see is criminal defendant trump to go to jail

the corruption in this country is beyond repair all these leftists are the true criminals this is nothing more than election interference

bad business karma will now begin to stick to those who try to illegally manipulate the system to their advantage
364 million a 3 year ban seems a bit lenient maybe the ag can appeal and get a higher amount heres hoping rapist trump takes the opportunity to flee the country never return
his entire life appears to have been a falsehood and fraud what a loser
who gets the 364000000 the banks were all paid back in full they are the only potential victims and they dont claim to be victims at all it was a crime without a victim and a trial without a jury so who gets the money
lock the contrump up is long overduehe owes it to the people most specially to ny he calls biden crooked yet he is what a con imo
itll get overturned in appeal
this judge is so damn corrupt and being paid by the dems with our tax money this is pathetic unwarranted and must be stopped immediately this world minus the fake news media such as cnn and msnbc who are also benefitting as well obama must be stopped and this freak of a pos lawyer needs to stop being paid
this is a joke when will we wake up
what a joke do not do business in new york if you have a business in new york get out quickly because if you cross the ruling class they will break you this was a stalinist show trial this is a message to the american citizens dont cross the dnc or we will destroy you trump was guilty before stepping into this fraud of a court everyone made money in these deals the sate of new york even made money there were no victims this was a political dog and pony show with this garbage the people will never have a choice for president again challenge the élite and they will crush you this judge is a disgrace to freedom
charge trump for everyones extra costs for their personal security because of trumps vile and dangerous threats
its a beautiful day

dang no one do any business in new york you offend the wrong politician and theyll just take everything bolshevik style you run a candidate against them theyll pay a foreign spy to cook up a faked steele dossier
trump sons are banned from being executives or on boards of directors of any ny company or company doing business in ny for the next two years for the boys or three years for djt all the good stuff is in the last three or so pages of the document good news for them is they can keep the business license since theres an independent monitor overseeing the financial stuff
that judge is a freakin joke and should be disbarred appeal this to the supreme court there have been thousands of business people who have done exactly what trump did with no problem nothing but a commie paid for political attack go trump fjb
trump just won the presidential election by a landslide congratulations
trump in prison 2024
239 can this be appealed or is this final
so what judge could say he is fined 355 trillion and he wont pay not one red cent
i thought trump was the law and order candidate
were the jail time for trump is your charge for fraud specially for this kind of money you must serve jail time why are they not going to jail this is not justice
he will now bankrupt the gop
he paid all the banks with interest and they loved doing business with him he also built up the city and this is how hes paid back i hope all businesses leave the city
the chickens are coming home to roost donalda lifetime of lying cheating and criminals acts are finally starting to stickthe us should be embarrassed it took decades to make this criminal answer for his deeds
look at the lefty dictators go so desperate to destroy their next president trump 2024
anything to keep trump off the 2024 ballot no one is fooled by these pathetic political based attacks
he got off with a slap on the wrist if any of us acted the way he did we would be waiting the trial to end in jail for contempt he shoved a pile of folders that were put together by his own side and just swiped them off the table in a rage you would see from a petulant child
so there was no crime committed no party was wronged yet trump was charged with no crime a jury convicted him of no crime and judge ordered him to pay damages for no crime its like watching a court in russia and all the democrats who are applauding this you have no shame
you guys fixed america the woke finally did it just kidding still losing this doesnt stop him from running nor stop anyone from voting for him
yes because no other celebrity or politician has ever lied about their actual wealth to make themselves look better to make themselves seem better qualified for loans or business dealings and things like that
crookedtrump takes another dump on his own business
he wont pay
doesnt mean hes guilty just another witch hunt hey trump you still have my support blackslatinos for trump wont chnage a thing in my book at all trump2024
he will never pay a penny
92 pages to say guilty as sin pay at the door now i know why i didnt go to law school both of his male spawn and his not really an accountant but he played one at trumporg cfo too long overdue
i am so smart smrt
every loan trump was given by banks was paid back in full trump owes nothing there is no victim a bias liberal judge is claiming that trump overvalued his properties to get better loan rates from banks that gladly wanted trumps business this shit is crazy it will be appealed
it will never be enough to offset the complete nightmare destruction he was to the usa
hey everyone we have an immigration crisis would you please consider opening your house to a couple immigrants if youre a sanctuary city or surrounding area please help out
meanwhile four hundred thousand tons of toxic ash have been snuggled at the feet of the mother reef of maui the very spot that all breed at and its rather strange that this dumping has been going on for almost 3 months now into an estimated 12 month dumping and not one single peep made by any of the state run alphabet news clowns not even faux news this is rather alarming being its being done under the umbrella of the self proclaimed environmentalist dems shame on the biden administration and these crooks they should be the ones standing trial for the soon to be poisoning of the ocean
i hope all government officials start getting the kind of scrutiny trump has
400 million not chump change gotten happen to a nicer guy
next up government seizure of trumps properties to sell at fire sale prices to make up the debt
most people know that this entire thing is completely illegal and ridiculous and theres absolutely no point in watching this video ill be surprised if you guys are even working by the end of the year lol
the judge if you want to call him that is a total disgrace to the profession complete jackass thats all i have to say about that
so hes just gonna pay his way out us regular people would be in jail for life
better lock down grandmas finances the fundraising on this has already began
lady justice has spoken
time to pay your bills trump
do not believe anything the news media says about delusional donnas chances of winning the presidency periat the judge has banned her for 3 years because shell be criminally convicted in march will quickly lose all appeals be ricoed and sent to the big house let me be clear scotus will not shall not and must not subvert the will of the hidden government in its ability to do what it does best off to prizo u go ms donna enjoy it
can we not see this is a witch hunt are you really that stupid
so now go after every company in ny because they all do it
you shredded the judge during the trial and now he just shredded your financial identity karma and accountability lets see how many fools answer your fundraising pleas you must pay your bills donald or you will be like nato
now he need some prison time
nato youve got to pay your bills
bawahahahaha it will take years before it is ever collected if it ever even will be they will keep it tied up in court til long after trump is dead i am sure before they will have to pay up
ill bet if they went after the top 10 richest real estate people they would find the same thing
im hoping all these trials get to him cant wait to see djt next to his first wife on hole 1 hope soon
absolutely ridiculous this has put the death stamp on justice in new york there isnt any you will be punished even when there is no victim while victims of violent crimes watch their attackers walk free from jail they will come for you next people even cuba is alarmed by this decision
the bank did its due diligence agreed on the evaluation and all loans were repaid
whos the victim here
what a joke democrats are so corrupt so the judge is smarter than the experts at the banks that said trump was correct that judge is corrupt and strang she is a loser every expert said this is a politically motivated conspiracy if you think this is fair you should not be allowed to vote as you know nothing about the legal system this is not about trump its about corruption in the justice system and bias legal syste you better hope this correction doesnt happen to you since you have no one to go be cause the system is rigged
whats really bad for him is the fact that has to have two babysitters who approve everything and this continues after the 3 year sentence as well hope it doesnt cramp donnies style
wait what was the fraud
the wheels of justice turn slowly but they are finally catching to donald trump
thats awesome this guy has been a business cheat for decades maga will make excuses and blame everyone but him
do whatever whoever when we got judicial power
a judge has just ruled that donald trump cannot be trusted to run a company in new york for 3 years how can anyone vote for this man to run our country for 4 years
that is such bullshit and fascism at its finest
hey trump is it worth it to be a president why didnt you just sit back relax enjoying life but instead you wanted to be president of united states so sad for you
so much winning i cant believe how much winning has gone on since 2016
come on this is a false judgement from a paid off democrat operative judge no victim no losses cnn absolutely knows this was a sham but continues to support the downfall of our justice system
so when the democrats lose the senate next year does that mean democrats will be sued next so many people will be sued theyll need an army of new judges
p0s corrupt judge day after fani goes down this comes out day after the tucker interview come out russia russia russia
this judge needs to be removed
oh oh repsi see a new begging email comingi hope they spend the last cent for their orange clown
please enlighten me how is he going to pay all this a presidents salary is about 400000 per year so say he wins this year can he pay up
attention to the most devoted christian conservative people who never miss church day maga cultists your souls and your money do not belong to you it belongs to the vulgar son of your god in heaven send in every single penny to the qanonwhite supremacist headquarters in order to save him
plus interest since 2019 sure hope he controls his bp thats a lot of stress
are you listening putin just need 355 million dollars give me a breakdjt
who is getting this money the financial institution are not seeking damages
libtards act like this wont be appealed
maybe you guys could give him another town hall farce
democrats have taken weaponizing the justice system to a whole new level are we suppose to not notice about 100 lawsuits against trump shame what goes around comes around
between this and the rape case he is at half a billion dollars in the hole sounds like he is going to be selling assets before long to pay his debts
will the banks be next to sue the trumps
these libitard politicians need to write a book on how to stack courts and blackmail judges
no business is no longer safe in commie new york
justice must be served
he is probably wishing he did not give away his salary when he was president he could use the money now
trump tell putin to pay it
putin got five on it
a total mockery of our judicial system and a 2 tiered system of justice he will never pay will either get thrown out in appeals court or the supreme court the judge is nothing more than a joke and a disgrace to the bench
dòn the con insults everyone and gets that smoke
did the new york attorney general ever promised to sue president trump there is a video circulating on the net where apparently she is saying that she will do so if that is the case you guys will make him even more popular than before
what a bunch of bull crap
ok maga culttime to dig deep in the pockets and bail the king out if you can pray to him you can pay for him
add insult to injury the taxes they take from that is goingto be used on the immigrant
totally not a political prosecution no siree nothing to see here no other property constructor ever does anything like this on ever single property they put up for collateral
this gives the american people to vote more for trump
appeals will go on forever
cnn is pure garbage
yah never knew him to pay bills without years of legal delays never do work for trump corporations former controller for major contractor they were black listed
what about his properties does he lose any
shocker never would have happened if trump was not running for president and leading beijing joe in every legitimate poll especially in the swing states he will appeal and hopefully not to another biased democrat judicial disgrace either way with the corrupt double standards of justice and harassment routinely applied by fraudulent democrat authority it was to be expected and it definitely isnt altering his pledge to the people
judge engoron is a corrupt all this for political reasons i hope his going to be in cage soon hes a fake justice only in us can happen this kind of fraud trial god with donald trump god bless him and his family
real bills he pays every bank he borrowed from was paid on time
judge trial by the judge that said trumps mara largo property was worth 110 or 120 the real value the banks valued lol ok
this means nothing
we officially live in a banana republic
another non bias pos democrat judgefollow the money trail to his bench
and hes still going to win the white house this year
did trump make a speech from his little cage
hey trumps look in the rear view mirror you see that beautiful city behind you yeah dont go back for 3 years oh and thatll be 355000000 for that hot dog
trump is a billionaire so no big deal no jail time sweet
so he cant run his businesses for three years and yeah people want him to run our country what the freaking heck he loves the uneducated he said it
id buy maralago for 18 million where do i sign up for that
this lady is a tool
trupmers always asking questions when they have google right in front of them research educate
november 5 cant get here soon enough trump 2024

now trump pay your dam billsthe ironylets go blue
that one buck for every citizen of the united states i will not be paying my portion thank you
worst part is his stupid supporters will be the ones who actually pay all these fines out of their donations not him
tell ny to pound sand
the victim was every business in ny that follows the law think of a cheater at a poker game he wins ill gotten gains
ny business take notice no business is safe in communist new york
hes not paying a red cent the appellate court will overturn this sham oh its going to be glorious to see all the liberal tears
trump will need to sell a ton more nft cards

its satisfying to know the ignorant trump loves fund his fraud lifestyle into bankruptcy or prison maybe they can pony up the 350 million he will end up paying
dont forget the 9 on that amount
this is sickening no laws were broken no relator or seller will be able to over estimate value on property form this day forward everyone will be guilty just like trump if they do even thoe the banks were complicit with the loan
wait why didnt he get the elderly man treatment like brandon
what about biden and hunter
maybe he could get sa loan from all his close friendshe has to put the money up to appeal this befor it goes to a different courtor maybe he will go to north korea and live therehes a low life
he need to go to prison if any of us commented only 5 of that fraud they would of sent us to prison for years if not decades this is not right no one is post to be above the law but it seems trump is it just take money to bend the law of the united states im sorry i meant divided states of america
he will get it from campaign money
donald j trump is the king of debt promised to reduce the national debt then he raised the debt 78trillion and his tax cuts for the rich made it surge add in the pandemic and he oversaw the thirdbiggest deficit increase of any president more of that no thanks vote blue accross the board always and save our democracy social security and medicare the supreme court is now compromised go joe 2024

this is a total political job the banks said everything was fine
trump said he is worth 10 billion so whats a measley 350m lol
hey trump and habba hows your day going
what a scumbag judge its going to bite that judge ass
this clown judge is himself a criminal if this is our judicial system were all in trouble stand against injustice
this should make him close his pie hole for once if not they will take more from him if he retaliates he can try to appeal the decision but in the end what he used to hurt so many small businesses owners that he left them unpaid after doing the work just shows you no matter how much someone says theyre worth get paid up front sorry donny you list it big time say bye bye to new york for a few years your ability to do business in the state youve belen fired
tds in these comments
i have no pity on this man he has taken money from everyone
so who gets the money
the stable genius cant seem to stop winning
trumps failure is starting losing his money money is all that matters to him trump only idiolizes money
judge engoron came through
he wont pay just watch
trump not satisfied with just huge sums money went after power and seems he will end up losing bothhe opened pandoras box on himself
if trump has to pay 355 million for overstating his welth then how is he going to pay 355 million thats how you know the court case is a scam if you have 355 million to pay in fines your welth has not been overstated cant trust anything gov now
every developer in ny should then be indicted as they all do the same thing but they arent running for president so democrars wont go after them
ill bet you my left arm trump isnt going to pay
if you watch and believe anything these liars say you need help
corrupt judges america is now third world fake lady justice
he got that money yall tripping if you think he dont hell likely try to bring it to a higher court chii but this just the case in nyc lmaoo

what a sham the judge should be dis barred
my last breath against democrat socialist and my last penny to get trump elected 2024
wonderful news
amazing i hope he loses his ass
the court has spoken the irony of the financial fines against trump is that he will never pay one dollar why he will manipulate the gop superpacs for money he will demand his delusional maga supporters contribute to his fines putin certainly will give him money saudi arabia will definitely give him money by his words and actions trump is a delusional ignorant narcissistic psychopath his problem is that he just will not shut up he will contribute to his downfall with a series of endless lies and fabrications trump is a lunatic
hello donald debt if he cant pay jail the sucker
he should have to come up with some cash for these people instead of just dragging on and on we all know hes broke
that judge is a crooked mfaker
trump is extremely popular among young menthe only demographic that actually matters same with law enforcementblue collar workerstradesmen etc and the military these men matter more than the left which is mostly chicks and gays
make america giddy again
that money will be used to house and suport all the illegals that continue to come to nyc
what a farce no victims etc etc purely political its scary
its times like this that im reminded of that great mexican philosopher tuco when he said circa 1964 ahhh like beeg fat mens like ju because when ju fall dow ju make a whole lotta noise an sometimes ju doan git back up
like 18 of his wealth
the judge went easy on trump
honest and trump is a major contradiction in terms
dicky don to pay massive amount finally
should be no big deal to pay since hes always going on and on about being a billionaire orange mussolini is done
don jr might have to switch from coke to store brand cola whatwhat do you mean its not that kind of coke
crooked judges are not going to win in the end
karma is a bitchthat what he was saying couple of days agoif you dont pay now you pay
new york budget just increased maybe look into tax evasion as well
in his closing statement trump defense attorney chris kiser claimed that president trump relied on multimilliondollar accountants at mazars and he should get a medal for his business acumen
suck frickin bs trump2024
ouch ouch ouch 355 million worth of unbearable pain keepem coming
and the witch hunt continues trump 2024
wow her over stated how much he is worth yet gets fined 355 million doesnt seem poor
what the trump university guy commented fraud shocking
a ny judge imagine my shock its far from over
all those years of stiffing small business contractors because he knew they could not afford lawyers to sue him what goes around comes back around
eriks wife will be putting in extra time sucking gullibles into donaing to his defencesorryhis campaign fundswho gets paid firstcarroll fraud guyslawyersalready begging for fund raising over being a victim
so wrong make effing biden pay for the illegal criminal trespassers trump will appeal and win
so trump because of wanting to be president causes you more than 400 million wow if just stay as business man he would be fine but no you try to make people miserable now you or the one whos most miserable right now karma be careful what you wish for
so sad what they are doing to trump new york is a stain in this country
thank you for support of israel
im with trump on this one it really pisses me off when i loan money to myself and then i misuse it and break the law dammit
all ive been hearing about is him deflating the estimate of his marlago estate can they show us any of the numbers in the case or is this just more bs like it usually is
automatic appeal litigations will last for 5 to 10 years
trump has no remorsebut karma has caught up with him i am assuming he will ne asking maga morons to donate towards paying this find of over 370 millon we yhe the people needs to vote blue come november
hey trumps look in the rear view mirror you see that beautiful city behind you yeah dont go back for 3 years oh and thatll be 355000000 for that hot dog
this country it become corrupt
he now has a lot less money for attorneys he has been raping our legal system
when trump pays any of the settlements against him then i believe he understands hes a criminal until then hes just another privileged asshole
pray for the judgehe is blinded by his hate
whatever it takes to keep trump off the ballot is what these antiamerican traitors are going to do wait until you see what patriots do
and watch the city of new york give this money to the illegal immigrants that are here instead of giving this money to the veterans that are homeless and a citizens that are homeless
don jr will have to cut back on the meth pipe
the democrats have weaponized justice system
if elected to cochair the rnc lara trump will funnel those maga donation dollars to pay those 350 million nyc is the biggest winner maga voters dont do it your will to go the city of ny which you hate
taking uncle trumps money cause that shit hole demorat state is broke laughable see ya in appeals court where you will loose and receive absolutely nothing but a box of kleenex for your tears uncle trump 2024 the revenge tour
what a bunch of bs this will get appealed and the judge involved should be removed and investigated anyone who know bout loans and buying property knows the bank is the one who decides what the value is not the government
this judge with the yellow ass teeth lookin like a demon cant wait till trump pays him back
elect a crook expect a crime
trump was a very successful crooked businessmanfraudster not anymore as of today
boycott new york
yeah good luck making that croc of stick cnn crap news network continues to suck
welcome to a marxist communist regime
notice the timing as democrats lawfare attack in georgia goes to hell with fani willis they had to push the judgement in ny today
he will just move his businesses to nj
like russia we need to encourage the law to do whatever the hell they want with this delinquent
time for that judge and district attorney to be disbarred this is the most criminal misjustice ive ever seen in my life
same judge that says maralago worthless joke
so one corrupt democratic guy can decide that trump must pay 355 million
the trumps consequences for being caught cheating for being a cons and fraudsters
hopefully trump orders the military to throw these people in jail for election interference when he wins for the 3rd time
sell a couple of malanias dresses
just a bunch of leftists talking all butthurt that trump is going to be our savior from bidens awful presidency go trump maga
another phony judge and his game to played never got it right
follow the money
yes trump knowingly misrepresented the value of his properties to loans yes he was unrepentant but this prosecution undermines the rule of law a highly partisan democratic attorney general has brought a fraud action against a real estate developer for fraud in connection with loans where no one lost any money this is a unique prosecution that looks blatantly political i dont like trump but this is very bad precedent this will gain trump tremendous political support from those who value evenhanded justice it was a stupid move by the ag
donald trump was found to have committed a crimenuhhh uhhh say it aint so
fake news trump will lock them up
cant spell engoron without moron
more trump digital cards coming soon including one special gold card of trump seating in his golden toilet
get the a blue barrel with a long red stripe to wear

conall chump should be happy since this ruling helps rid new york of crime
to appeal this hes required to post that amount as a sort of bail or get a bond hes not eligible to get a bond because of his 91 criminal cases against him this will clean him out if he can afford it
pay your bills donald chimp
yes limit the right to do businessa grifter finally getting some consequences
lock up the bastard
another big win for habba
trump figured out that he doesnt need to run businesses anymore he can just grift his cult base for however much he needs as long as the keep giving him money hell keep taking it
appeal incoming
shows how stupid this attention seeking narcissist would even run for the presidency major spotlight is what he got and deserves given time these stupid narcs will eventually hurt themselves thank you ms james
appeal
letitia james is just another slave demoncrats use to execute election fraud
once again this is sad because the judge had already made a statement that he was seeking 370 million from this man so that judge already had his mind made up no matter what evidence was being proven or shown that this man was innocent and that whoever he did business with profited as well this judge just stole this mans money and he already had his mind made up to do so
i strongly believed that the scrutiny that politics puts you under would be trumps undoing
im disappointed irs only a three year ban
of course hell appeal he always does that but he wont get away with it this time loser
could felon muskovite let him some dollars rudi cant
this case was over before it started talk about a fraud the judge has been foaming at the mouth since the beginning im going to get trump no matter what
fake chargea
boycott new york we love and support trump
what such an incredibly rich superbillionaire needed loans for is beyond me unless hes a bullionaire
the more you fascist f go after trump the stronger he gets
justice and accountability catching up to mr fraudster i cant wait to see him in a federal prison wearing a special outfit
hey judgehow much money were you paid by the biden family everyone has his price sleeping at night is the hardest to do when a guilty conscience creeps in your dreams
this is pathetic they are nothing buy crooks those judges they are trying to break that man its not right shame on all of them
looks like someone landed on the boardwalk box
good luck getting paid professional con with clowns helping him
trump greatest president of all time
why did they wait this whole time to do this until he got into politics
stunned alina habba didnt just win this case outright
362 million dollars lmfaoooooo now thats u make america great againi love ittt
now look at black rock investor s
this will only gain him more votes
what the fuck is wrong with these judges with their draconian punishments just because its trump how transparent and uncalled for i hope when he becomes president again he can do something about these ridiculous democrats they try to bankrupt trump but let murderers back out onto the streets jeesh
trump still got off easy he is not banned to do business in new york regardless of the fine
no limit to insanity the democrats will go to any length to prove it this lawsuit is legal insanity legal robberies
you guys are all so dumb his money is in trusts out of his name and banks in other countries if you think hes paying more then 5 a month ur dumb they will never get more than that from him yall want to see him down so bad that he cant afford to campaign but guess what he still will keep crying liberals and eat your 15 dollar burgers and keep paying crazy high rent gas and car prices with sleepy joe
maybe nato or anyone else wont protect him if russia wants money back
trump2024 beloved by we the people
you are giving your rights and freedoms over to people who dont want you in the process as long as its trump it must be right half the country is so blinded by a fanatical denial of this double standard going on in our country all the replies i get will be from dumbasses who assume im maga and dont have the objectivity to look at the attempt at all costs to keep trump off the ballot in november you should want him on the ballot i think fear runs deep in a lot you
dont worry my supporters will pay for me more donations please
this report leads me to believe were all pawns you dont actually believe that this will happen do you
hell yeanow we have reason to celebrate this weekend
no victim no trial just a anti trump judge doing his part to help democrats corruption at its finest
trump will easily overturn this absolute farce in the supreme court appeal trump did what everybody do gave valuations of what he believed his business was worth to the banks to get loans the banks then sent out their valuators who valued trumps business and gave trump loans based on the banks valuations the banks all got their loans paid back on time there is no fraud victim trump will easily overturn this absolute farce in the supreme court appeal the democrats have destroyed the justice system for now but all of these judges who have committed corruption will all be indicted for criminal corruption all get found guilty and go prison when the republicans hold office
what a crock of doodoo
just say it cnn tell the truth this whole case is garbage say it i guess you cant can you your bosses wont allow it
absolutely bummed he wasnt kicked out of ny entirely as deserved but its something
and yet the sackler family killed people
this trial is nothing but fraud
lmao the judge was a big democrat hahahahhaa fake jew news
the judge swears he is not gay but his boyfriend is a known liar trump fined more than 350 million in new york business fraud case put a liedetector on that judge and ask him how many times hes dreamed of fellating trump dozens is my guess
the kind of stuff organized crime bosses get convicted of hows that for a clue
its obamas paid off judge
for a billionaire all those judgements shouldnt be a problem handle that and get back on the campaign trail
hey trump you cant outrun to long arm of the law
i feel sorry for the citizens of new york after seeing how these prosecutors were colluding and coordinated by the whitehouse and left a trail of receipts and gps data to prove it
so much winning
the citizens are the victim how dumb are these experts trump inc never paid the correct property taxes
it sad to see how many people have hate instead of justice in there minfs trump is not guilty trump 2024
who owns that judgeclinton
yesssssssssssss finally some accountability i think i just heard his head explode
so stupid this will be appealed
i think judge engoron was very lenient in his ruling
anyone else tired of hearing the dual standard justice system charge trump every week with something new while the real criminals in washington go free
atrocious judgements wish they get none its just too ridiculous
no one lost any money heck they mad money this will be turned over
pay payment plan of 50 monthly
oh yes trump is already asking his followers to send him money lol and those followers still what that loser president lol
and hes telling everyone he won the case hes completely off his rocker and crazy as you can get but again his followers will believe him
speaking of fraudsthis judge
the judge himself and all the individuals running usa right now are the real corrupt ones and they need pay for their crimes
trump has been crooked for decades glad its catching up to him
so much winning
he aint got that kind of scratch
trump lawyers said he never failed to make a loan payment or deaulted on any loans a quick search reveals a much different result such as httpsyoutubea7v2teaoxkmfeatureshared his lawyers lie and he lies he also defaulted on numerous loans with duetche bank
as disgusting as cnn watch out citizens you are next better be prepared
he is screwed big time
pelosi and all dems should be in prison for treason and inside trading
doesnt change a thing
all three guilty i encourage the court to do whatever the hell they want if they dont pay
so trump finally has to pay some tax
ahhh just popped open a bottle of champagne whats bad for trump is great for america vote blue
leticia james rot in hell
thank god hes getting pay back from what hes caused this country now he needs to serve time for the other crimes hes committed
this is unconstitutional how am i going to pay my lawyers now well i wasnt going to but now i cant
trump needs to tell them to go pound sand
his lawyer said he should get a metal he will dont worry get a lot of metal that is when hes imprisoned
in order for trump to make an appeal he has to cough up 100 of the money he now owes
he will just appeal for eternity
trump doesnt have 355m eric and don jr dont have 4m firesale
finally some justice
which trump property is sold first
a few dollars from half of his supporters covers this shit easily
this judge just stole this mans money that woman sit there and admitted on the hot seat under oath that and lied and yet the jury and this judge just stole this mans money now just imagine if that was you there is no justice same way with fani youre a corrupting our justice system to steal
channel of idiots
if you read any of the liberal comments the ignorant stupid liberal comments you have been made stupider
total bs all just because they are afraid of trump they are all out to get him and prevent him from running for president it wont work because we the people want our country back and the corrupt rotten jobama government gone
trump will win a bunch of sick democrats he is a real leader
people see him as smart i dont know how they do that he ruined everything his grandfather his father built he destroyed their legacy and how do you think hes smart
a school yard bully gets his dues
poor donald no really poor donald

no one will do business with them after this its only getting sketchier from here
i like presidents that werent fined 355 million

plus the money he owes to e jean carrol its now up to over 440m ha ha at this rate hell owe over a billion soon maybe be sitting in a prison as well howwhy anyone can still support him is ridiculous
a beautiful thing
now what we are left with an old man demented and cant fine his way off the stage great going democrats youre all assholes and jealous our guy can think and function trump 2024

this was a tremendous victory the most beautiful victory we were expected to pay 357 million but now only 355 million this is the most beautiful victory for all americans so much winning
judge yellow teeth needs to be disrobed
i think this is sticking to the teflon donald trump yaaaaaaaaaay
total bull shhhh a victimless crime while fat fanny has committed multiple crimes
355 million on top of 64 million when will his supporters understand he is a con man the amount of evidence of wrong doing the da has to have in order for them to successfully prosecute someone in this way has to be astronomical
does anyone know if trump has to put up cash or a bond to appeal this judgment under new york law
his idiot maga supporters will give him the money
fabricated case are country is going to because of delusional dementia democrats and woke media like cnn
with ten years interest please
a paid off soros judge of course this will be appealed
renato looks pleased might have something to do with trump firing him years ago for being such a good prosecutor
bring on more indictments like the millions he took from foreign governments violating the emoluments clause
well i did not pay my bills so im a delinquent now judges can do what ever the heck want to me
trumps diaper just went to a tailspin got to love it are commander and thief t rump 2024
this will easily be reversed on appeal
new york has complete lack of contrition does anybody believe this other than democrat politics let someone other than new yorker answer
all hail donald trump supreme leader of the united states oh and fjb
send trump all your money please i cant stop laughing at yall
trump so much winning the gqp will be sick of so much winning why does the gqp want a rapist fraudster and seditionist
who was actually damaged in this case the banks did not complain what a joke
dont you just love it when bad things happen to bad people lets see 355m 883m sitting next to rudy under an overpass with a tin cup
democrat judge all political had he never ran for president none of these bogus blown out of control bogus charges would have never happened all bs by ppl trying to overthrow the 2024 election
finally paying for his crimes needs to do the time
you wanna be a boss in the court room prepared for accoutability
trumps supporters are going to have a tough time coming to grips and what he did here not this wont even register on their dumbeddown radar polls next week will be saying they are more likely to vote for him now regardless a win is a win and im going to enjoy the heck out of this week while it lasts
trump university fraud trump foundation embezzlement sexual assault civil suit loss defamation lawsuit loss ny state fraud loss first the profile of a serial career criminal throw him in prison for a life long weight loss program
lets go trump leave new york its trash no one wants to even visit
let the gnashing of teeth wringing of hands and endless whining begin
i bet he claims it as losses on his taxes
you heard it maga you owe 355 million start pledging
appeal pending its not over till its over not one red cent will be paid trump will win on appeal
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha breathes hahahahahahahahahahahaha now watch maga shell out money to pay his bills hope the crap mugs and collectors cards are worth it
evidently the judge doesnt seem to know what he has against him democrat judge prosecutors lawyers all democrats they all have to pay much more than that and the government has to pay for the next 700 years there is many people have billions against the government so they are not a winner because these people are collecting each and every second of the day for the next 700 years there is no way they can get out of it its rockhard
its okay chump will get the maga morons pay for this his legal defense
no one will get a penny
hope he does not pay
this ruling is so bias its disgusting
quit saying thre were no victims what about the lenders insurance companies and citizens of the state retract those no victims statements now
little out of hand
can he still run for president and win
just think he couldve been on the up and up and only had to pay 168 million in interest instead
as the fate of the rnc is what it isare magga not donating
this judge is a corrupt clown
fyi this case is whats coming after everyone corruption of the present dictatorship is going to come after more businesses in ny better get your business out of ny
this is so much garbage
only weaken the nation i am so sorry for being an american
judge is such a fraud hope he is awarded more in countersuit
we all know trumps comment blame and insult ad nauseum
who is this judge why not 1 trillion from this judge
fraud to who
when he wins in 2024 there will be some sweeping reforms
now hes hawking bobblehead figures of himself how very fitting
and who was the victim in this crime i keep forgetting oh thats right a bank that didnt even bring a single complaint
all the money donald and the trump crime family stole from american people as president its time to collect
you act like thats going to hurt him how many billions does he have again
trump im a billionaire never mind ive declared bankruptcy half a dozen times and grifted my way into most of my money justice then fork over 350 million a drop in your billionaire bucket trump the rnc doesnt have that much though waaaahhhhh waaaahhhhh
pamelaedwards what about the banker who said he followed their guideline and done nothing illegal whats illegal are all those illegal immigrants coming through the boader none tax paying citizens or contribute nothing to this contry thats taking resources from the anrticans people who will be held accountable for that fraud and how much it costs another question why are the illegals here america wants to know trump 2024
tonight we raise our glas for judge arthur cudos to you good sir
the confidence of the ignorant he has eo insurance so he wont have to pay it also who was defrauded the lenders were aware of his exaggerations 30k sq ft was really 10k sq ft ok cant the appraisers measure square footage i believe they can so the lenders knew the fraud and lent the money and got paid back whos the victim of the fraud new york hardly anywhere other than ny this case never wouldve seen a courtroom if you hate him hate but lets not allow zealous prosecutors and politicians to create traps to catch political opponents if we do that were finished as a republic
kangaroo court adjourned
you idiots it just wont happen but i guess you need to claim some victories even if they are shallow
the former president is also barred from serving as an officer or director of any new york corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years but he could still be president over the state of new york grrrrrrrrr
we knew the democrat judges and all the democrat cronies were going to find him guilty they will never get a dime of that money by the time its all over and new yorks going to need all the money they can get when were done sending them all those immigrants
that should of been compounded by 9 every year for the 6 years the case is for and he should of been band from ever doing any business any place in the country because of the depth and breadth of the frauds he has been charged with and the ones that we know he did that have past the statute of limitations he will do it again with out a thought because he dose not know how to run a company any other way
anybody that supports the democrats is supporting communismthat is a true fact and if you know anything about socialism and communismyou can actually see it happening in this country with the democrats as long as bidens been in office democrats in you will see socialism and communismand with everything they do
petty should have been higher
with this new judgment against him he owes egene curl 88 million 355 million you do the math
our justice system is a mess corruption is so widespread we cant think straight marxists have taken over
make maga great again heep heep oray trump the biggest scamma imposter criminal that every existed imposter
so much winning
a corrupt judge like this should scare the hell out everybody you people that agree with this clown are really sick you really need your mental state checked
this is bs
criminal should have been criminally prosecuted long ago lock him up
hey magano worriestrump is bigly rich this is a nothing burger trump is probably laughing because of how little money this is good job trump
justice is blind evidently deaf and dumb too
this is a sham appealappeal appeal karma will show her ugly face you judge should be ashamed jealousy and an evil persona have just left their mark on you
total joke of a justice system just shows how low the bar is in the us give your heads a wobble america youll end up like a third world country in jig time
i hate cnn liars
tap on the wrist and he should have been banned for life
tds is strong here there are those that dont owned nothing love evil outcomes
today is a great day for accountability
that damages figure is more than stupid
another leftist judgement that will get tossed before a dime changes hands we need to employ this tactic of frivolous distracting lawsuits on bidumb just to make things fair
very very dissapointing that he didnt even reach the das ask when the clownish behavior during trial merited a penalty above and beyond
his followers crying in the comments like it affects them personally nice to see

they knew from the beginning of this case what the judgement would be against trump why taxpayers have to pay for these court cases stupid i would hate to have a court case in america
can you imagine what he wont be caught for doing
your telling me major banks loaned hundreds of millions without doing their own appraisal and due diligence they wont even do that on a 100k house this simple doesnt pass the smell test its obvious political persecution
hey maga tired of winning
if the bank appraiser loan officer agreed to the amounts then whats the problem oh politically motivated litigation
meanwhile biden steal 60 billion more dollars from us and cricket noises
twotier justice systems sickening shit

trump derangement syndrome runs deep in the justice system right now compromised

so unfair clearly a stacked deck against trump all democrat judge just wait till hes president and see what happens
everyone should leave the fraud state called new york sick state
i have been waiting for this good news for a long time thank you cnn
how do you over value property banks that would loan this much money usually have independent assessments done to verify value for giving loans over 7 digits bottom line are the loans being paid back
thats not a judge hes a crook
don can borrow 350m from tuck tuck got that much man
i love this country
trump is now 433 million in the hole send him all your money magas he knows how to bankrupt you
they dont approve of his daughters marriage
hes worth billions who cares
great news made my day
i didnt hear the banks complain about anything such a corrupt government we have
this is awesome he finally got whats coming we all have to pay if we commit fraud etc finally he did
trying to bleed him dry while hes about to save the country these people are absurd when they cant get him criminally they handpick courts and judges to be civil attack dogs ashamed of this country now good luck with fani saving ya
political witch hunt i voted biden now im voting trump dont like to see anyone hammered by crooked justice system
that judges face is a hate crime
grandpa tre45on does not pay his bills may be putin can invade maralago and seize some of grampa tre45ons assets
if trump give me 1 milhon i let him to hidein the van by the river
its why hes pressuring his daughter to run the rnc so he can siphon more money for his legal fees
great he has fines he wont pay and can run his con schemes again after 3 years another slap on the wrist for trump america talks a lot about justice for all which really applies to you
make america great again go do your business else where ny doesnt love you
wow seems to be a war on white males or any one white ok great this is where we are ok lets see what happens
dont worry trumps cult members will pay everything
it should have been a bigger fine and it should have been a longer suspension
that judge looks like hes been out for trump for years political hit job for sure perfect timing for election interference
crooks running our judicial system this will not lie here the people are not blind tho you wish it so
all wacky democrats from new york not one person testified that trump stole or took money from them i can say i am worth any amount its up to the bank to verify witch hunt the only thing missing is the judge having affair with da fails on appeal
what are you going to do now donald trump ask the americans to pay your fraud charges through your un american campaigns interesting all of your loyal cronies that helped you in the past you abandoned now you want us to help you my vote is for nickie haley i do not want a dictator for the united states not even for one day or one second now pay your judgement on a timely manner after all you stated you are a multi billionaire so what is 358 million dollars to you should be a drop in the bucket oh we forgot to mention pay your attorneys you already burned a bunch
they act like this wont be appealed
how many cases like this one in the last fifty years in ny im guessing zero
we got trump this time lmao
we in the know already knew how trump operates his business by cheating and conning everyone and everything he must be made accountable forsuch as his taxes and his illegal assessing of his properties that he has blatantly claimed that he was being audited for so many years is simply him continuing his con and trying to avoid being caught doing all of this as president is beyond anyones imagination noone would attempt to defraud the government while taking oaths to work for itexcept this total con trump this con is not to be trusted in anything he does or says for he is a narcissistic liar
this was the civil case now waiting for the criminal one
kangaroo courts at their finest
money addiction greed is not just a capitalistic problem and trumps not the worst
i dont pay taxes because im smart fat donnie aka trump 355000000
why isnt nancy pelosi getting sued for her insider trading
this judge is a complete joke
lol dems need trump see hear about trump every day
trump allowed more americans to die than hitler covid was rampant during donald chump
like no one seen that coming itll be overturned in a higher court
good lock him up next
and thus the first telling blow is struck by the legal system do not let up
thats a superyacht
trump still gets to do real estate business in new york total bs
i wonder if the banks will sue him next for lying to them
trump got caught with fraud does a bear shit in the woods
were just about into ww3 three conflicts raging china russia and israel our money is now worth half what it was 3 years ago an invading army was let in by biden and is gathering arms and getting readyfor an attack we have islamic terror shutting down traffic and attacking people our police are hand cuffed so they cant help us with crime we have fake climate change destroying our lives but at least we dont have trump
cant wait until the biden crime family has to answer for all the illegal money they got
this is a bunch of s h it they are not disbanding trumps company this would be the results with anyone else the monitor which was to oversee the companys business up to this trial stated that they were not disclosing all necessary company transaction details to her that a whol can still orchestrate through some other criminal minded individuals he will somehow delay payment
what a presidential contest 2020 election biden w 1 trumpo l 0 criminal indictments biden 0 trumpo 4 criminal 91 felony count civil law suit biden 0 trumpo about 4 or 5 2 loss total penalty 4438m grand champion for the most stupidest and idiotic criminal the world has ever seen trumpo dumbo hehehe
a victimless verdict shameful and this is election interference
trump will simply use it against them impossible to beat trump
this judge is one of soross boys
lets be mindful of our lessor intelligent americans those who are crying all the maga tears they have left those with all the hurtfeelings what a sad day this is for them their inflation has just gone up dramatically
this is just harassment of trump
no one cares usd is monopoly money for trump his currency is power now
bunch a bunk
unbelievable trump an innocent man meanwhile biden rubs himself on children and cant even remember his name
that judge is a thief he wouldnt let his lawyer defend himself guilty before he went to court
i doubt hell pay a penny and then in five years hell get his licenses again what kind of crap is this
also with this mod i have i can see the dislikes 58k good job
get your credit cards out maga sheep your god needs you
such a joke all these dummies liking this weaponized lawfair wait until the shoe is on the other foot
dons going to crying maga tears today 350million 85million435million dollars that trump does not havemiss carrol should put a claim on all trumps properties in florida
thats one way to kick off the weekend
only 355 mil wow he got cheap away
all his suckers will pay that bill for him probably a fundraising email going out now
to hell with that communist treasonous leftwing antiamerican judge
bull shit the banks has there own people that know the value of things he is not at fault its the banks
trump told nato to pay their bills
so giddy here cnn soo happy
there goes trump tower
he might have to start flying business class on regular airlines now
american propoganda is hard to beat
whats hugely suspicious is that i dont follow any of these fake news outlets yet this is all over my feed what a smear campaign and a verdict this is to dictate our next election
and the wall comes tumbling down
was anyone expecting this corrupt judge to render a just verdict
trump sindromecase s are hoax to the max2 tier justicenot america
an injustice and what about hunter hilary joe etcwho actually did break the law oh thats right they are democrats they are immune from being persecuted
trying really hard wanna all over the place now trying to bankrupt him wanna is a hot mess whats next all this just to stop one man and the media like juicy news like this
the end is nigh
this is bs
ah the judge took it easy on them now they should never cry about not having a jury trial a jury would have stuck it to them
corrupt democrat judge bought and paid for by the democrat party
ketchup futures soar
every american who owns property every commercial developer in this country best hunker down the communism is full bloom now the most unreal civil case in history decided by judge engoron who just showed putin how the democrats play the court system in america
seems the art of the deal is cheat cheat cheat
dont worry his idiot supporters will pay for it
now officially a crime family
if you are giving to trumps campaign you are not yhwh you are up paying for this mans sins he is using your campaign dollars to pay his legal fees why you would give you hard earned money money to any politician is bewildering let alone someone who is broke and in debt
i am not crying at all i cant wait until president trump walks back in the white house i have grand kids normal ones being raised not to be wimps and treat normal people people with respect but not to take any crap from anyone stand tall and strong because they are americans and were born here
it is interesting that he talks during is presidential bid how much his trump brand brings to the table as president of the us his entire brand is all fake numbers though i also like the nato comments below spot on
words to remember donnie get that son of a bitch outta here
liberal fascists will do what fascists have always done prosecute and imprison the political opposition
mega supporters was sending 1 now they have to send 5 to his campaign and his legal fees donald trump pay zero
hahaha breathe hahaha the beginner of justice
when hes president again i bet he will sue cnn for harassment
woo hoo yeah beeeeeotch get some f with the tax bull get the horns
justice for all tired of winning you rpist
355 million is not even equal to what donald trump and his family has stolen from the american people through tax fraud over the years
the point is that youre pointing out that its all personal mean it is political full persecution you ought to hurt him but i got news for you the american people the blank buying is anytime a win reelection you go out to piss and moan about it
can judges be disbarred for blatant miscarrages of justice
its only going to hurt ny president trump 2024 president trump 2024 president trump 2024
what the lobbyists that funded this bullshit just now are jumping off cant run and hide buddy borrises
wtf look i dont like the orange man but you people have made up all of this ive given up on liberal causes because of all the lies
about time pay up
pay your bill orange tangerine man i have the nerve to say other country doesnt pay their bill what a joke this joker is
trying to bankrupt your primary political opponent because youre scared hes going to win is going to backfire spectacularly come november the biden admin could not be demonstrating their fear of orange man more than theyre doing now
he is all ready sending out emails asking for more money
i think rudy will be ignoring calls from trump tonight looking for a loan the saudis will be fretting that the 2billion doesnt go missing to maralago
couldnt have happened to a better man than defendant ttrump
so who gets the 355 million that lying judge
the dominoes are beginning to fallits definitely taken too long
j jonah jameson thanks for the good news
is this the childrens channel apparently
yet the banks never complained
good the deadbeat trumps have to pay
this should not be a problem for a billionaire since he swears maralago is worth more than a billion he should have no problem getting a loan for half that amount using it as collateral heehee
yes what you do say in life eventually comes back to bless or harm in the form of karma its karma time for trump co
lets hope this is the beginning of the end of trump
trumps words are biting him in the ass regarding nato 355 million plus 833 plus 5 million on top of interest and lawyer bills pay your bills trump
trump and his cronies cry about a twotier justice system true but its not how they think
and theyll never pay a dime
what a rat he needs to be sitting in a criminal courtroom being tried for those 91 felonies he was indicted on
do trolls and bejing bots andeer each others posts
thats a slap on the wrist
theres a special place in hell waiting for that judge
they will never pay a dime corporations are tripping over themselves to leave this corrupt state who would want to do business here knowing that they can remove your right because of politics good luck ny
not surprised everyone in their right mind knew that would happen now it will go to appeal
i wonder whether this will shake putins faith in him as a useful tool
woah thats alot of cash they are really trying to destroy this mansmh
rofl
good we got im
and do the interminable appeals process begins
donald j trump 2024 all the way
waiting for trump reaction
dumped trump like a chump
they wouldnt do that to hillary she would arrange accidents for all of them
do you smell that thats trump shitting his pants
maga tears everywhere haa
when is the payment due
oh what a lovely day this jerk is about to claim bankruptcy along with him all loans will bring a number of banks into bankruptcy
what a farce what a kangaroo court
hows fani doing down in georgia
this is good for americas democracy trump has to be held to account or is this a witch hunt
may be the rnc can pay this for him and the lemmings will keep sending their campaign checks in
dont get excited cnn we all know there is no fraud on deciding the amount a property is worth people work for the bank that makes the decisions as well
unfortunately there are still poor gullible souls out there that will keep donating millions to this grifter to pay his debts
this ruling is ridiculous and everyone knows it he will win on appeal
deep state continues its harassing ways
its a minor win for trump he can still do business in ny and his brand will stay intact
i cant stop laughing and i dont feel bad about it even a little bit
for believers in the concept of original sin donald trump is the poster child
we have biased judges who are making unconstitutional judgements against the bill of rights but also against a former president that has irreparable damage on all presidents ability to make decisions affecting the nation and the world without fear of prosecution after they leave the office and judges who violate us citizens constitutional and civil rights they are laying the fountain for tyranny in the united states of america
proven fraudster proven rapist tired of winning yet orange jesus
this case will get thrown out the window when he gets a fair and honest court room i mean when the das number one mission is to ruin trump we already knew the out come this was no surprise just like ol fanni her time will come glad to know shallow americans are giddy about this as new york just released an illegal alien gang member on bail for 1 after beating on police officers think for a moment if you did that mean tweets though haha
well that wipes out allens bonus
hell appeal because its already a farce zero proof that whacko lady cant even remember what year it allegedly happened there is no victim in the loans even the bank executives said so only a judge trial a trump hating judge so its a political attack in an election year
everyone in realestate does this kind of thing i can see the courts flooded with cases wasting prosecutorial time that could be better spent on crime
e jen carol5 million then another 833 million and this 355 million he will have to sell asset to pay all this its not jail yet but a great start4433 million
didnt trump get a lifetime ban in ny already in a prior judgement if so is this a reduction to just 3 years or is the lifetime ban superseding
such a 100 lawfare case we are now a banana republic
thinking that there will be zero consequences for your actions in your whole life is beyond idiocy that is like thinking you are exempt from death itself
he wont pay a penny of this money
does this number include the 9 interest penalty
he could have happily lived out the rest of his life as a wealthy man best known for saying youre fired but instead he sought more power and its ultimately costing him his legacy i wonder if he thinks about that as his head rests on the pillow every night was it worth it
the sheer amount of sheep in this comment thread is astounding
if the over 74 million people that voted for trump in the 2020 presidential election give at least 500 per person the trumps would have more than enough to pay up whats owed
political overreach to the absurd even democrats can see this is fascist
trump wont pay nothing military tribunals coming soon
delicious
oh what a tangled web we weavewhen first we practice to deceive not shakespeare
this is a man who cant run his life how on earth is he trusted to run the country
what bullshit trump 2024 he will get it back and so much more cnn is garbage
make it a billion he wont have to pay a dime his polls just doubled go trump repair the damage done
will the nys dept of taxation and irs sue them now
karma is finally starting to catch up with ketchup con man aka donny douche bag i cant wait for the rest to come
appealed fkn idiots
trumps a multibillionaire so this should be petty cash for him right trumptards
come to the cnn comment section to see all the delusional morons out there lol never disappoints
and yet no entity has claimed to have been defrauded
he trying to go back to get loans in america since hes been dealing with russian mafia and now they are done with him
trump is the tip of the iceberg they all lie about their assets so they dont pay any taxes
this judge is crupt
id refuse that was a complete sham trial no matter what one thinks about trump love him or hate him the court violated due process on several levels and the verdict would go to appeals all the way to scotus and no one would get a single red cent until the scotus actually ruled on the constitutionality of the lack of due process perpetrated by engerons corrupt court
he says theres no victim looks like hes a victim of his own crimes cool beans
trump will come out on top ingron said he was guilty before the trial was that a real trail if are government lets this fly the democrats corrupted are country its not the usa anymore biden is the cause of this its part of the bidens crime familys
i almost feel bad for him because we all know he does not have that type of money
absolutely love that news could not have happened to a more dishonested under handed criminal in us history but im innocent his favorite whine
this judge is so fking corrupt a total biased pos that already has his decision before the trial even began trump will win on appeal
if they can do that to him they can do it to everyone be careful getting loans if a bank does not do their due diligence then you will be liable
in america a man can be found liable for sexual assault and defrauding the government of 355000000 and not spend a single day in jail god bless america
the tax payer is the victim obviously
i disagree that there were no victims he cheated the bank out of money they could have charged him and received how is that victimless
maga nation before you get started please understand and realize that trump is no victim what is hehes a habitual liar someone who loves to fabricated and a career conman everything that happening is selfinflicted and long overdue
victory now he has to lose the election so we can forget about him
great news break out the champagne at last con artist trump is getting what has been coming to him for many years maybe his family and him will stop cheating others lying and getting away with it obey the laws like the rest that is simple and true
he must appeal this decision it is wrong the judge was partison and did not like donald trump all the people going after trump dont want him back in the white house he was exposing them for the evil they are democrats want complete control cnn msnbc have been totally bias for the democrats they refused to report any good that he accomplished
it shouldve been more and he should never be able to do business in new york again he stole enough from the people of new york
will be tossed on appeal
this is making yall way to happy what goes around comes around the whole judicial system is fixed bring biden to a red state and let tara reide sue him for his assault on her we will give her 80 million dollars this is political 1000 rfk 2024
hey maga every dime you give trump will go to pay this huge bill
attention american citizens mrs fani waste 50000 for her campaign they went after mrtrump for money resources and abuse of power going after mr trump to keep him off the ballot and indict him on deformation of character mr wade said the money he got was never reported for income taxes file the judge is violating mr trump rights when he got substantial evidence and facts mr trump from the bank mr trump didnt commit fraud this judge is crooked and hes about helping them to put false claims in against billionaires this judge should be disbar for judge abuse and being bias against mr trump this is dead wrong of this judge no equal justice mr trump has a right to get justice the judge is ignoring the bank testimony that he didnt commit bank fraud
thats gonna cost the fan base
i see democrats have no plans to put a capable presidential candidate to defeat trump so they resort to bankrupt him two weaponize the doj and send him to jail three weaponize the legal system to remove him from the ballots and four character assassinate him through the media little does these people know is this is making him more popularits like 2016 never taught these people anything
hooray keep it going congratulations to michael cohen
trump will fleece the republican party for millions and the down ballot republican canadates wont have any to campaign with in 2024
get real he wasnt a succesful businessmanhe wasis a corrupt con man watch where he gets the money from this is likely why he demands his daughter in law and 2 friends take iver rnc do people not see with their own eyes what he is and how he rips people offsmh
america happend in eastern europe thouse judges killed milions persecuting opponents we come from there president yrump america is more valuable than zer will vote for you by millions 2024 election is yours investigate next year all that persecuted you and terrorizing our country z
bunch of bull
trump will get the money back from this maga stupid
yeah some maga supporters are gonna go bankrupt too paying trumps bills
lmfao all the morons here in the comment section dont understand that this judge has had every appealed case over turned enjoy it while you can youre vindictive behavior wont be satiated
trump should sell all his properties and leave new york
this trial is fraud so i wouldnt be surprised if trump does not turn around and sue bragg and the judge
it would be justice if some of the money was given to the poor workers that the donald had cheated out of their wages over the years
democrats rigged justice system corruption
president trump is god almightys trumpet to wake us up to what is happening to america
trump has also previously been found liable for 83 million in the ejean carroll case to add to these latest fines in the face of factual reality and the rule of law wannabe dictator trumps endless bs and criminality has finally been called out lets see how the serial liar and loser fares in the other trials particularly the election denial and fixing attempt including the j6 violent insurrection this is beyond time for justice to be seen to be done with this nasty divisive crook
no sane person agree with this crap
ha ha pay up chump er trump nah chump as in harry potter justicehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyymxazx5xtk
plus the 83 million creditors collection agencies due what you whatever the hell you want the stupidity of leadership in trump org has everyone laughing at you you delinquent lmao
not enough
hopefully they appeal this because the judge was a bias judge
this is hilarious not only because it shows trump for the fraud he is but also because trump is gunna take that fine out the pockets of the idiots who support trump a double whammy his supporters are among the dumbest people in the united states they claim to hate corporations and the elite of this country yet they send their hard earned dollars to a billionaire owner of the trump corporation this stuff cant be made up
jared trump may ask for a loan from that 9 billion you criminally got from saudi arabia
omghell never pay the money himself hell grift the money from the magas
why should the big crackpot be worried about paying hes raking in millions if not billions by selling or exposing his collection of stolen documents what other reason would he have for hoarding classified materials at his residence for lining his birdcage
tell me how crooked the bidens are again we know who the real crook is if this was any average citizen they would be locked up but ding dong walks free
they will be melting down the thin gold plating on that elevator for the liquidation coming soon
now everyone knows he lied about his property valuesincluding the irsgo after him for tax fraud he obviously didnt pay his fair share of taxesalso great that his two evil spawn sons are guilty as well and must pay finesmaybe don jr will learn about proper accounting procedures now
trump u can try to delay paying eg carol here dues but u definatly cant delay uncle sam bugger
maybe he can get a loan from his soninlaws 2 billion he got from the saudis
the point is this whole thing is a witch hunt this is politically motivated every real estate company works in the same way why not prosecute every real estate company because they are not owned by trump this will only improve his poll numbers
maybe you will be next
trump will go up another 5 points in the polls appeal the case and win the judge will eventually be remembered as a corrupt goofball
happy friday everyone

trump was always an unscrupulous businessman who failed in many of his business dealings he will probably now ask his cult followers to help pay this enormous debt the teflon don isnt so slippery to get out illegal activity after all
the bible said god will be justice to lawyers and every make the law and be wrong justice i wait for gos him give the triumph
not paying taxes is not smart when you cheat on them
poor baby i almost feel sorry for him just kidding
im almost inclined to start a gofundme for the poor guy
the curtains are falling
he has around 40 million cult like supporters hell asked them for 20 each to pay it off half hell tell them that he will pay the rest
to quote nelson ha ha to quote vlad where my money btch
these people are out of there minds
all these biden supporters in these comments yall gonna be sick when trump wins trump2024
trump will appeal and win again
that is really exciting but lets see if he actually pays a dime he is probably going to try to fight it and then he will use his supporters money to pay for this
the bety about this is he will not understand why
that is exactly why trump wanted european countries to pay
who was the judge
wont see a nickle of it watch
his supporters better mortgage their houses to help poor guy out
thats like 460 million hes lost in 1 monthhow does the man sleep
pleasethese gays are trying to murder me
do it again dummy donny lol
the irony wants to get paid for shaking hands with the easter bunny and saying norad tracks flying reindeer but he doesnt
he and his magas want him to be president of the united states of america and run this nationbut the law the court and the evidence found trump cannot run his business for 3 yearsguilt of fraud magas wake upfacts are facts and you all have been defrauded and conned by trump
and mar a lago is worth 18 mil
finally a great win let all fraudster be aware
its all catching up to velcro donny trump hey can you send me the i gave you in 2015 dont worry your broke lol
send your money to don the con magats youre cult leader needs a bailout
courts are a scam
wasnt enough hope the trumps are banned from doing business in ny all together shouldnt they be done for perjury now
cant do business in new york but can be dictator of the united states of america wtf insane
trump is not morally fit to be our president or the president of this great country
trump supports israel and ukraineprint lots more dollarsmore tariffs on americans
f nato pay your fare share our protect your self lol
something stuck
this is bs what happened to the ny tax of 9 year after year compounded so dumb
this is insane activist judge is disqualified from making impartial decisions none of this would be happening if trump was a democrat its political persecution and election interference plain and simple
tick tock tick tock almost time to go to jail fake tan man
guess they have to dig up ivanka and get some cash
this has go fund me written all over it
im so happy the delinquent must pay more and more and more
big surprise that judge said he was guilty before he was indicted
trump will just appeal appeal appeal until hes dead so he doesnt have to pay one red cent
best part about thisdumb libs still think trump will pay a single dime of it haha
all yall on here think maralago is actually only worth 18m the number the judge ruled its worth in contradiction to trumps estimates giving him leverage to take out more loans this story is insane since owners never assign value to their assets its the banks job to do its due diligence i can say my house is worth 1t but ill never receive a loan on it unless they asses its value all of you praising this are completely insane and delusional
corrupt radical judge breaks the law and tries to influence the election
this is disgusting you libs must be ecstatic
here come the judge
imagine thata partisan democrat who broke precedent for both prosecuting a former president and also prosecuting for fraud with no injured party declared him guilty watch the double standard with anything related to the bidens
is no obvious victim there actually are victims as of 2009 or so banks were forced to put a cap on what they could loan out by lying about his financial situation trump was taking loans away from people that otherwise could have gotten them okay we cant specifically name them but that is the situation anyway you know whats a great analogy for this nobody got hurt defense a cop pulls you over and says were you drinking and you say yep but i didnt hurt anybody and as we all know the cop at this point shrugs and says youre right on your way
355 million for what because the criminals in charge dont want trump to be president so they will do anything they can imagine include illegally using the justice system with a podunk judge and all
trump is a liar and raper and corruption and racist and needs to be fired and prison period
happy friday now pay your bills
its a great day for justice now go put him in jail fani
trump will never pay a dimethe scotus will throw this out on appeal because its nothing but a joke
donald trump are you tired of winning yet
hell need an increase in his allowance
how many other property developers are they charging if he is the only one then you know whats going on
more money harvested for ukraine sorry israel u get nada zippo zero
love it trumps thug sons 4 million each its good friday
hey donaldclose all your ny businesses and let all those people go find new jobs then incorporate all your business outside of delaware like elon is doing and lets start teaching these idiots a lesson in their wallet
lolhell never pay a dime you simple fools
i pray every single dollar of the 355 million can be established forensically without a shadow of a doubt he doesnt have 355 million time to send out the fundraising emails
trumps entire life is a fraud hes been scamming individuals businesses and banks for decades and its about time hes held accountable for his crimes and wrongdoings the day for justice has come and the teflon don is gone
and this is who you want to lead the country wow
i dont wish harm on anyone but i am ecstatic with the judgment trump has gotten away with multiple crimes for decades he has cheated people who worked for him out of money for decades karma was very patient
another bullshit hoax judgement from a fake biased democrat judge this will get squashed in appeals court
paula there is an obvious victim and that victim is the people of new york and those who could not get a loan because donald trump cheated and got more than he deserved
so very refreshing to hear
slap on the wrist
thats pocket change for a multi billionaire
this is a great day in américa
the beauty of me is that im very rich lets just see how rich
what a bunch of malarkey
not enough it should have been 570 million banned for life running a business hell just start up asap
wow thats a lot of cabbage
next time i get a mortgage i will do my own valuation i guess
i thought the numbers would be much higher
if he was an illegal immigrant his charges would be dropped and wouldnt have to pay anything
finally
im guessing mexico will be paying this for him maga make americans gullible again
working class americans hate rich people that can cheat the system like this that dont go to church and brag about themselves constantly yet most of them see trump and say yep thats my guy he is the exact person they despise wtf
the constant refrain from trump his family and his lawyers has been letitia james ran on getting trump as though that was some kind of gotcha what they dont want you to consider is that trumps decades of fraud bankruptcies and unpaid bills elevated him from an average businessman to a criminal that ny voters wanted dealt with tish james has honored the voters wishes who knew donald trump better than anyone
that phantom loan for 46 million yea that probably came from russia follow the money
of course trump thinks he won this one hes so tired of winning like this all the time
karma is bitch
if trump owes he will pay but not only trump will pay everyone will pay when they break the law
this is just awful we had one civil war and now headed to another
the long hard dildo of consequence rarely arrives lubed
the judge said that the former presidents complete lack of contrition bordered on pathological engoron
guess how many people are gonna lose their jobs now at trump inc answer34000 people congratulations yall
what a great friday
pay up trump 355 millions got to hurt lock him up all you suckers trumpers donating to trumps presidential campaign are actually paying his lawyer fees
a drop in the bucket for the multi multi self proclaimed billionaire
cnn crooks too
the orange orangutan is about to broke oh waitmaga voters will donate money to pay his bills what a clown show
such bull
this judge is out of touch with reality there are so many corporations that are looking at this trial and wondering wtf this judge is smoking
i love that judge
trump needs putin more than ever
hes an uber billionaire apparently this penalty would be just a rounding error for such a person
this is just so wrong money hungry people
yeahthat judge is sooo honest
this is attacking a political adversary
you mean the summary judgement by the rabid flaming liberal judge he wont ever have to pay that bs
crooked judge
all this is bs vote trump 2024 fjb and the democrats
there is a god now for his criminal trials for inurrection attempting to overthrow an election and stealing national secrets
teflon don busted mafia style
who is the victim of the fraud how can a decision be made before the trial who will receive the payout the banks and insurers or the state
the biggest loser
i wonder what scam trump will come up with next to get donations for his cult first it was nfts then it was material from his suit that he wore in court
you gotta pay your bills karma mrshitsinpants
did no one watch the kevin oleary interview literally every investor does what trump did go after one you must give after the others or what this is political prosecution and that wont play in your favor in the long run
its about time
shouldve been more severe trump accrued more than 350m on the back of his excessive valuations over many years all of the assets that he purchased on the back of these fraudulently claimed loans shouldve been seized
and michael cohen gets vindication the federal justice said cohen told the truth
i bet he shd on himself when he heard this
they wont get a dime crooked politics and judges
these idiots are just gaining him more voters
how many times can he delay payment by taking the case back to court who will pay trump or will he continue to exploit the support and trust and limited finances of his vulnerable low and middle income supporters trump is no robin hood he takes from the poor to pay for his crimes
finally all the times he cheated on his taxes in ny pay back will not be fun ha ha
when its reversed new york should have to pay president trump 720 million
what a beautiful day for law and order in america congratulations to the prosecutors and the judge who didnt cow down to the mob tactics vote blue
that judge is corrupt he will be the one going to jail and maybe worse
i missed something wheres the plaintiff it is the banks job to make assessments regardless of the borrowers assessment the banks were paid back on time as i understand so who is the plaintiff has to the judge made himself plaintiff all sounds bananas to me sorry just a lot of lets hate trump
they made him pay his fair share
justice is served with more to come
maybe they should be going after the person whos really a threat to america hows the southern border doing last 3 years hows new york and other blue cities doing with a flood of illegals and high crime all you hypocrites
and donald who says that you have to pay the bill in nato or russia can do whatever they wants but donald can do anything because he seems to have imunity on everything
this is a joke trump 2024
railroaded
that will never survive appeal
i dont see the problem the trump criminals can just borrow the money from jared since hes got 2 billion just lying around
they should have taken his hotel to shelter migrants
its hurting the boy his cult followers will actually pay
a lot of zeroes only one zero and it is called donald j trump
i hope trump lose everything
im sure that the demented orange sociopath trump has already filed an appeal which his gullible followers will pay for
this plus barred from doing business for 3 years 3 years justice has not been served here
oh happy dayyay this is so deserving of such a con man
will be overturned in appeal in a nonbiased court with prejudice
362 millionto new york statefor what ill gotten gainthis ruling seems like ill gotten gain
there needs to be a trump fraud through the years retrospective
wow thats a lot of zeros
the amount of idiots in here is amazing
lol is he going to single handedly get his party bankrupt
no business to ny but he can sell seashells in scamlargo
hypothetically speaking since this fine will never be paid who would receive this 355 million new york city or new york state to pay to illegal aliens
arent this news tired of report garbage
one thing that has proven a certainty if you ride with donald j trump you will lose
well i will remember this when he was president again but will be crying
and you democrats all voted for mindless joe biden and you talk about corruption you people cant even look past your nose and you think trump is bad you have to look at yourself if you think the things that donald trump are bad and you dont think that joe biden did anything wrong youre going to the wrong church and youre praying to the wrong lord i pity you people
oh cnnof course what would they do without trump
is this free game on those real estate
sad to see democrats try to bankrupt trump
gotta love that hideous looking preskid row pic of trump
another member of swamp judge snowmiser engeron who must be taken care of by nr 46 pres
look at that the justice system actually works for ones
lets see 2 cases he was convicted so far that makes him a criminal just what the republicans love
i mean he should have it right
you got to pay your bills
stopped the border deal encouraged attacks on nato lost multiple cases and more maybe those trump nfts and tshirts might keep him afloat otherwise im sure russia will bail him out
the trump empire was built on lies and deceit
omg first the 833 million and now this case and 3549 million total is 4382 million trump tower is worth 153 million with a 100 million loan on it other properties estimates are equity of about 400 million total assets
cough it up con man
this is a great day for the state of new york because now all these hundreds of millions of dollars coming in to the state can now go to the immigration situation in new york city as a democrat i would like to personally thank all the maga republicans throughout the country for giving trump all of their hardearned money and their paychecks if it wasnt for all the maga republicans giving trump their paychecks the state of new york would not have such a mighty windfall and all this money can now go to the immigrant situation in the city of new york
congrats cnn this is the only way you get clicks youre a joke of an media outlet
we live in a banana republic
drumpf singlehandedly destroyed himself by his actions the onlthing that bothers him is paying these fees im curious if rnc is going to pay for it
judicial corruption at its finest
for the migrants
hallelujah buhbye longstanding criminal enterprise known as the trump organization so much winning so presidential
pay your bills donald
the extent of this political persecution is disgusting
great news for justice even rich con men are not above the law
weaponizing the justice system disgusting
trump will ask his supporters to pay this judgement
dats whack man
now lock him up nah he doesnt need the extra votes
its about time some justice is given out
he will be more popular and all bills will be paid by his followers
trump plans to appeal in other news the sun will rise tomorrow
trump scams everywhere i would bet the amount he says he paid attorneys is probably half with trump pocketing the rest
he is so rich it is loose change to him as he clams
well hes a billionaire so
thank you judge
i think all these judges are influenced by social media and the trend against trump
lets go with biden the biggest crook of them all who ant run a hot dog stand
i love this comment section everyone here is cheering for political corruption while believing they are some how shielded from it because of political stance the pendulum swings both ways be careful what you are advocating
appeal this travesty dont pay a dime to any onemake sure tha pos is in prison for the rest of his miserable life fjb
i am soooooo dissapointed trump should have been fined much more than 355 million
accountability is not dead hell yes
paulas smile the blonde lady is priceless finally the 45th corruption has been held accountable
so now he is found guilty of fraud again will you now cnn cover this as much as the biden is old narrative
not harsh enough
hail to the chief teflon don
pay attention liberals this is what real fascism looks like
362m and he has to cough it up now
he want to pay in cash tomorrow
first time ever someone found civilly liable for fraud without a victim this will be a quick appeal
manneven i dont have that much money and im laughing going to the bank
if trump avoided paying taxes to ny state and ny city why are the state and city not being harmed
he will go down as the most corrupt president in united states history everything that he claims that everyone else does is a smoke screen to hide his own corruption he needs to be in jail where other rapist are
youve got to pay your billsdonald trump
this will get overturned what a joke of a court
i guess now everybody will ask for his money back this is it trump has to put 439 million dollars on the table plus the layers he doesnt have that money
how do i loan myself 40 million
ahhh what about his daughter
ok jethro cash that welfare check your kult leader billionaire needs some money
you cant touch me im running president theory out da window pay up crooks mafia don
for fucks sake trump should always be referred to as the former president also trump cant appeal against the original judgement made by engoron that ship has already sailed he can only appeal against the severity of the finedamages and then he must put up the 3549 million in full as a security deposit in the highly unlikely event that trump successfully reduces the penalty new york state will then refund to trump the difference between 3549 million and the lesser amount
if you libs think hes gonna pay a dime of that well thats why liberalism is a mental illness
poor man ill send him 1 russian ruble from italy
odd how this is occurring right before an election bs hell still win
this angers people not at trump and the fact theres nothing they can do about it
88 million for raping and lying and defaming and 362 million for lying cheating and defraudingfolks this is an expresidentcertifiably the worst in the history of many countries histories not just the us and we havent even started the criminal yet i do not have tds
if your still bashing trump after this three year circus your commitment to stupity is impressive
good to see donald is made to pay and relinquish money he loves so much
erik don jr should hit up their sis ivanka for her share that she somehow weaseled out it was clear of the 3 siblings she was the one really doing daddys bidding

trump is a selfmade insert sarcasm billionaire right time to pay

haha a bond what bond company is going to cover a high risk client like a trump and if trump does secure a bond its going to come at a high risk percentage rate can even trump afford it now all you republican donors better starting digging deep
it puzzles me as to why all the people stand behind him and let him spout on about what a crooked judge and system it is just tell don to shut up
and as usual cnn misses the big story which is targeting a political opponent with the justice system
opps sell the jet golf courses hotels
so happy if he doesnt go to jail at least will pay every single how dollar he stolen

it will be appealed and i bet he wont pay a dime when it goes through appeals
for what aging
well done trump you want nato countries to pay up but cant yourself what a massive hypocrite
crime pays for anyone but donald
cnn suck fake news this not true it will never happen

88 362 450 million in the hole im not an accountant but im guessing thats a bad first quarter for a stable genius businessman
today is a beautiful day thank you judge you are a national hero
is this one that canwill be appealed to scotus to a conservative majority scotus that harlan crowejustice thomas is ethics challenged

cnn and cnn viewers who comment they all are ignorant with closed eyes who just see trump as a villian but that worst biden as an actor or hero for this country and all they do is the passage of the time with yellow electric school bus within the passage of time suuuck yaaa allll go ta hell
judge is a biased like your news what a corrupt state ny like cnn fake news
how much does it cost the republican party to get these things to the supreme court

what a farce
new york would give trump towers over to the migrants then they re going to want trump back again snd i hope trump sues them
now watch the irs go after trump and his family capone went to jail for tax evasion this wannabe mob boss is no different
the us seriously needs better legal guard rails against dtards this ruling was way overdue happy for it
if any average person had committed fraud they would serve a prison sentence and the amount trump has made by doing fraud he should get 20 years but it wont happen because hes rich
407 hes been a failed brand for decades he will play the victim as always and hell be able to garner more support from his fan base so i guess we get to listen to him whine even more during the next ten months or so ill bet you 100 he finds a way to blame this on joe biden
the 500mtears of a clown

this is however the usa a twofaced country with corruption rife within its poor excuse of a legal system so there will of course be appeals from the whole bunch of fraudsters i expect followed by more appeals no doubt in the uk such fraudsters would be jailed if found guilty of such grand larceny but not in this immoral place of indecency would i be correct in assuming that if someome stole a few thousands in cash or less that they would almost certainly be jailed with no appeal allowed
trump stop payment to all lawyers
this judge is pure corrupt scum
eric fredo trumps punishment is he has to read a book that doesnt require crayons it would have been harsher but the judge quickly realized what a moron he is
trump isnt a politician hes a businessman a shitty incompetent crooked businessman but his supporters think thats good thing
justice is making america great again
how does anyone in this country still support this blatant crook seriously you cant come up with someone better than this
a person commit this kind of fraud and he or she will goes together for 30 years a company does the same fraud and only gets banned for three years the system is so broken the rich will keep getting richer while the poor will be poorer disgusting
these cabal courts are criminal
the judge should be disbarred leftist activist
don the con has experience with creating big losses don the con has managed to bankrupt three casinos trump foundation and trump university and he has to pay 5000000 in the first defamation suit and 83000000 in the second defamation suit and 354000000 in the tax evasion suit this should not come as a surprise especially when he hires imbeciles like alina habba babba as his lawyer

appeal appeal delay delay do we really think that he will pay very little if any of this
democrats electing trump with every douche move
all his cutting corners and cheating ended up costing him so much more
judge said get outta town
that judge is corrupt he openly stated he was going to find trump guilty at the beginning of all this seems pretty shady
this makes me wanna vote for trump even more
woo out of breath sorry i had to dance around my house with joy
i have 7 billion in the bank trump
read the judgment 3 years no business for trump and all business licenses yanked pretty much corporate death penalty cabot barrow money and cabot be in any financial position for 3 years also 2 of his officers got life time ban
i believe that his identity is a serial rapist thief and fraud he was never wealthy but lived off others
payback is a bitch oorahamerica the 45 loser has to pay in billions
ladies and gentlemen on your right you will see where the trump towers use to stand having been taken down when the criminal donald trump went to jail

massive obama conspiracy against trump httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvc6_ftjpdyrc another sleazy unelected judge placed by sorosclintonobama no evidence no grounds no proof no ability to act as a real judicial here we go again with another fake trial with false accusations and no evidentiary proof more of our tax dollars were wasted by the lameduck administration
lets not all act suprised already in the 80s there were publications on trump being a fraud the media knew this yet decide to act as if we only now find out
this will be easily overturned in the supreme court when the republican get into power all of these judges will be arrested and charged
just gimme the rent
i know this is off topic kindly get the word out that house speaker republican mike johnson a trump puppet is responsible for the death of 1000s of ukrainian solders by holding up and not giving aid to the fledgling democracy in ukraine the blood of these young ukrainian solders so many of them nice young men is on the head mike johnson and trump sleep well at night you two read on thousands of young ukrainian solders are dead around avdiivka because mike johnson is seeking political leverage over biden by withholding ukrainian military support and now thousands of ukrainian solders are dead because of him it is immoral for mike johnson and trump to back the murdering thug dictator putin by holding up ukrainian support also dont worry about the money they want to make you worry abou the money because know that ukraine support only costs 65 of the yearly us military budget kindly check out the military cost part in your own searches i am a republican or was and i am disgusted with the party leadership allowing this to happen to a fledgling democracy in ukraine that only wants liberty and freedom and stay out from under the boot of the thug putin i thought the us supported democracies ukraine is a sovereign nation attacked by putin because he wants ukrainian businesses ports to use ukrainian agriculture as blackmail and to force young ukrainian men into his army and use them to attack the next country on his list putin has already tried and failed to use foodstarvation blackmail tactic by blocking ukrainian grain shipments to africawhich you can also check out on your own too ukraine is the primary key to putins larger war plans and he needs to be stopped now give the aid to ukraine today right now again the blood of these young ukrainian solders is on mike johnson and trump because they have held up support for polictical reasons which is immorial go nikki vote for nikki sorry i had to get that in
i smell a fire sale i wonder who is going to snatch up the tower because this appeal aint gonna be free

trump can pay this he says his a billionaire
his sycophantsll have to start donating their hard earned money to save their messiah ass quick
trump is a perfect example of a looser he went after cohen the guy that knew all the dirty dealings how stupid can one get 354millions here about 90millions for the defamation case i hope china or the saudis can bail him out
gop is winning so much this year
so happy its about time pay that bill donny
what a crock
this cvnt has never paid his bills convict45 is guilty af he will need diapers in prison
goodbye trump empire
it runs in their family to cheat disgusting
great now go after all the people and businesses that kept saying what trump did was acceptable business practices in real estate because its not acceptable practice for regular people who own property there is no two tier system
looks like michael cohen got the last laugh on fake billionare trump
judge and biden have the same problem
you guys are so dumb hes going to win this on appeal because theres no victim
just another bill for his most loyal maga supporters to pay up for theyre king lol
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha readem and weep or should i say whine suckeeeeer lmao
this is bananna republic
what a shame and disgraceand to think about that crook running for president of the united states of america
oh yea cnn gloating now snow miser needs to be brought down and punished for a ruling he isnt even an expert in it
the whole thing is disgusting these fools
unprecedented trial case against trump never anyone else like this just happens to be against the leading candidate vs biden in an election year there was no victims and issues with the bank loans purely political
trump himself is the worst return on investment all those magamorons should think twice before they donate to his campaign
should have been a lifetime ban from doing business in the state of new york
the communist new yorks corrupt democrat party is 110 out of control democrats better be careful the democrats are destroying america who in there right mind will want to do business in communist democrat owned city like new york no wonder people are moving out of new york
time to pay up loser
trumps a lucky fellow doj was asking for 370m and the judge has awarded only 366m against the family as i calculate it jareds 2billion will probably help
lol that money will never be paid and trump will be president again these ass clowns are throwing everything they got at him and they still cant get him on nothing but maybe he slandered somebody lol its a lot of money for slander
make all those idiots pay when you become president again
will the irs bring him up on tax fraud charges now more indictments
its a typical kangaroo court in a banana republic
cue the campaign donation emails
putin helphim trump make a good job
djtis fueling the planerussia here he comesdress warm traitor
so tired of years and years of tds attention not doing anything for problems at hand
hey donald remember ya gotta pay your bills
if he gets to the white house again hell pay hes bills with our money
this is absurd these demoratz election inference ruling should be banned and struck down by the supreme court once trump appeal this fraudulent verdict
accountability ro people who never endured ut feels like injustice maybe if trump was held accountable for things he did early on he would have been a better person now the n his old age hes a disgusting losthesome pos
i like former presidents who dont have 355 million dollar fraud decisions against them
couldnt keep his big mouth shut
i wonder if hes sick and tired of winning yet
hahaha successful much donnie cough up the money von schitzenpants
his sons are liable what about his daughter and son in law after his son in law received 2 billion dollars from the saudis are those two going to run trumps companies anybody know
melamonia there goes the money you worked ao hard to be part of
0001_ nato will not pay trump bills
why am i so damn happy today i used to be a grump old man
let the apoplexy begin
cool
judge eggmoron and chunkytubbs james are the frauds here they are nothing the biden administrations puppets that do their bidding
in some ways not giving the trump organization the corporate death penalty it keeps them in new york and under new york jurisdiction with a independent monitor and corporate outsider to regulate the business will ensure that if he breaks any other laws the new york ag will have jurisdiction
his cult members will pay it and then complain about gas prices and bidenomics
that con man owes so many people he will never pay others but he wants our nato allies to pay
final for trump trump lost all credit voices pay for evils minds
it may be only a three year ban on doing business but it seems unlikely anybody in new york is ever going to do business wth trump ever again outside of the us it seems only slightly less unlikely i suppose in three years if he isnt in jail or completely broke i hear a lot of fingers being crossed he could start up again in republican states but what bank of repute what insurance company is going to cover any of these future ventures also with a criminal record hell have trouble getting a job i see trump finishing up as a right wing online radio host assuming he outlives prison
delicious
take that conaldhis kentucky low income meemaws will donate their ssi so he can pay it though
thank you judge for enduring all the nonsense and verbal abuse you had to endure throughout this trial
falling off my chair laughing truly could not happen to a nicer guy take care all its easy not to end up here dont make your tax statements do somersaults
go ahead with this disgraceful fake story president donald trump has we the people and thats the majority yay
grumpy trumpy is a loser
trump had a way of corrupting people i hope the monitor is a strong person
his lawyers did a great job
i highly recommend trumps book the art of the deal how to lose the house then senate then presidency republican party then 355 million trump the great fraudster vote biden
maga russian spies will vote for trump in jail
why does this make me so happy
trump will appeal this fake case and win trump will also win 2024 i bet many businesses and business owners will be bailing out of new york for free states like florida and texas
they wont get what think appeals court will reject on the grounds of how and what the judge said before the trial
all his bullshhas come back and devoured him nobody to blame but himself
for sale gold plated toilet slightly used
great every developer get in line no just trump because they continue to meddle in his election process the people see you might have a few thousand that believe your bs millions disagree and see it clearly for what it is
i guess you dont like my post so just get them gone huh
is an appeal an option
his finances will be jeopardized not only in new york but pretty much anywhere he will probably have to come up with ideas on how to get the money for a bond since there is not going to be any company willing to get involved in this matter the judges ruling responsibly didnt create chaos there are innocent subordinates affected by this but restricted him in such a way that he no longer could conduct funny business in new york djt is in the hurt locker for sure
well deserved
yes hold his family and team accountable finally
we have taken enough of this poor mans money after his next trial lets send him to prison
i disagree that there were no victims in thetrump fraud trial by him deflating assets for the irs it meant that in order to balanace the states budget ordinary citizens had to pay extra taxes this is similar to the effect that shoplifters have on the price of goods insurance fraud has on premiums etc
excuse me how is there no victims he defaulted on bank loans that is why he couldnt get loans from american banks why else get loans from deutsche bank back by putin come on man
please maga go broke for trump
take from him everything because he been stealing an laing all his life
trump can simply sell maralago i think he said its worth 15 billion
next upjail time
what a great father he was getting his kids involved in the family business of fraud
how can you be guilty of fraud when no one was defrauded will be reversed on appeal
does not seem like enough but whatever that is still an unreal amount of money
watch his poll numbers go up
now trump has to sell off the whole rnc
tired of all this winning yet supporters of trump lol
keep the justice coming because its beyond time that trump is held accountable
isnt he a billionaire oh i forgot he has to pay 9 interest on the penalty he is going to ask his followers for a handout i wonder how many would be willing to throw their money away
got em pay them that money agent orange
this will bring him votes
he was successful business he think he would get thru with the crooked deals to be a success business man nothing last forever
and he has to come up with 354 million plus interest out of pocket or get a loan if he wants to appeal
have you learned your lesson anyone running for office must release their taxes no tax returns no play
why is norm eisen calling from his shower
so if youre white you just have to pay a fine for committing decades of blatant fraud instead of going to prison for it hmm touché i aint even mad
cmon people you dont think this is fair do you dont you remember no banks were defrauaded cmon supreme court
2 down 89 more to go i cant wait to see him in jail
for sale trump tower taking reasonable offers
thats a very expensive cheeto

pay up sucker
wheres his presser now you know he wants free coverage
hes going to be going through a lot of diapers they say s himself when he gets angry
this so wrong anyone taking pleasure in this is lost
the devotees to the abuser of veterans convicted rapist taxcheaterwhether ordinary people lawyers congressmen or evangelical christianssee him as the source of something very precious what is it they crave which hes offering them
he only gave him 3 years of not doing business in new york city youre kidding another pat on the back
finally more to come the traitor is over just wait til he deals with losing the en t few cases convictions abound
far too low should have been over 500 million the orange abomination got off lightly
trump couldnt have expected anything less he insulted that judge and his staff constantly
i dont think trump will live long enough given his lifestyle of poor eating and massive anger outbursts to even get through the election my belief is his has cooked his own goose sotospeak and if he is not rendered physically incapable or otherwise remains to be seen
can we just give hillary clinton credit she spoke on his taxes first now look
fantastic bravo great news
finally some faith in the system
next jail for that bum
that stinking pos traitor has been corrupt his entire life and its about time he gets to be held accountable for his many crimes
so nice to get a refund michael cohen is vindicated
trump should be in jail
so much winning lol keep on that winning streaks better get your orange ass to russia asap
straight to appeal
he can make it back stamping out license plates
wow he got off too easily should have been banned for life and should have paid the full 370million
you maga better buy his new bobblehead dolls buy like 5 for kids and grandkids if not you support sleepy joe amd are a rinodeep statemarxistsocialist
this could not have happened to a better person
5000000 83500000 354000000my pocket calculator cannot handle that kind of money
an idi can see this is fraudulent even trumps bankers basically said theres nothing here what a joke no question is going to be overturned
355m nyc civil fraud 83m e jean carroll defamation 438m total penalties 450m reported liquid assets 12m balance available to flee to saudi arabia lonng live liv golf
just another witch hunt thingy
make accountability great again
i stand with trump hope he will still be eligible for the 2024 election
so much winning
trump will have to inflate his assets to raise the cash to pay the 350 million or dupe his loyal base to sell their children to pay for it president fraud for 2024
yesssss its only in the beginning
i really hoped for closer to 500k
devastating as it should be
he is going to have some nice interest on that 355 mil the longer he delays the more he pays
that judge is breaking the law his evil looking smirk says it all
alina habba has made herself a millionaire out of trumps litigation unfortunately she also made her client a millionaire at the same time
way to go judge and ms james now will you all wipe the smiles off of your faces poor citizen trump and grifters
the furor will finally pay
another victory for trump only 355 on the 370 askedhahaha
trump will pay us back if we go homeless for him he pays his bills
trump wins again wow id think hed get tired of all that winning i wonder what trumps next grand prize is gonna be some kind of allexpense paid vacation ill bet
if trump is not a fit person to run a ny corporate body how can he be considered a fit person to be president of the us
this man is worse than the gotti crime organization
instead of trump running businesses in nyc nyc chooses gangs to run their businesses in nyc from the day of the verdict nyc will be cursed with gangs setting up businesses that will destroy nyc foreverbut that is the choice nycs ag letitia james and the judge made businesses will start moving out of nyc because they will fear going through what president trump and his family have gone through keep laughing at trump nyc the laughter wont last long trump needs to sell his nyc buildings to venezuela who has big oil money through valero energy corp and valero gas stations in the united states venezuela can thereby turn trump tower and other trump buildings into shelters for the venezuelan migrants that would be the sweetest real estate stipulation ever
trump will call president xi to pay the bill
you are stealing trumps money that will come back on you someday i wish i could be around to see it
a lesson from the left on how to lay out a red carpet for your opponent
appeal to supreme court justice will be served
trump will not pay a dime of this fine it will be reversed on appeal because there are no injured parties all loans were paid of in full and on time with all interest this judge is digging his own grave in fact he looks like he is dead already
yessssss now how about some jail time for the orange creep
lol they say that the wheels of justice turn slowly when i imagine the wheels of justice i see a gigantic yellow road compactor rolling over trump at one inch per day and it just caught his toes should have happened decades ago but it will be sweet to watch
fanfuckingtastic hows all that winning going for you dumpster fire shitler
yay take it all
is trump going to be paying ongoing security for engoron and his clerk
he looks so cheap in his bright blue suit and loooong red tie
ooo wee lol send him your money maga
lol theyll never get a cent from him trump 2024
3 years is a joke the man is laughing at that then back to fraud
dont know whats going to be flying around the most ketchup on the walls or crap in his pants
trump will distribute this among nato countries 2 here 2 there
man this election is gonna be crazy
meanwhile sam bankmanfried who stole billions of will get nothing and will be out partying with murderer alec baldwin the world sees this corruption and will act
its severally equally liable meaning any and all are liable regardless of the individual amounts
this was expected from the thirdrate banana republic level court in new york the justice system in new york is political and corrupted just my opinion
trump just told his lawyers youll have to sue mme to get paid
maga lets sell our our houses and go homeless for trump we need to lose all for him
that judge is corrupt himself higher court will put him in his place back kn small claims
wasnt there something about drain the swamp
trump went bankrupt about 6 times i think there was a lot of victims to his corruption
so much winning trump magats so much whining butwaittheresmore playstupidgameswinstupidprizes nooneisabovethelaw teamlosers for the good of the usa voteblue
ha ha it will be overturned no question watch in the end this judges time is over and new york city will deeply regret this
couldnt happen to a more deserving crook
for anyone wondering what jared going to do with 2b hes gonna use buy to buy trump out its cheaper than paying taxes when he dies
i never have to see that stupid name plastered all over the greatest city in the world nyc only suckers get beat for 355 million
anyone who still can find this man fit to run on our country congratulations on being a puppet
time to pay your bills djt i like a president who is not a sex offender and rapist save america vote blue
saudis will float him a loan
got my own problems dont need tv medias problemswheres jesus u c that big treeur saying jesus is a treewell i never thought of that b4mayb tree of knowledge and tree of lifebut no jesus behind tree taking a whiz
new york taxpayers trump vendors and bankruptcy courts had been defrauded by the trump organization 02162024 response by political analyst and strait shooter cliff strait telling you what mainstreet media their commentators and their pundits will not tell you i like how cbs disabled their comments while they lie about there not being any victims just because trump paid banks they miss the fact that the new york taxpayers had been defrauded by trump lowering his property values thus not paying his fair share in taxes then he paid banks but defrauded his vendors by not paying them and then filing bankruptcy based on lower property values this is all fraud the 3year ban basically is a life ban for trump actually trump is getting off very light because some of these crimes are considered bank fraud crimes for filing false bank statements the department of justice should have been the first agency to have filed charges for bank fraud but because merrick garland is the current attorney general trump is receiving deference that no other taxpayer would receive this places trump above the law it is very clear there are at least three or four justice systems at play one for the very rich the powerful white privilege and another for minorities
his cult supporters will help him pay for it trump has always been a fraud
time for the pro russian network fox and news max to start pushing even more hateliesand misinformation
the gullible followers will donate
all of florida is out of ketchup
all the maga cultists are flooding the comment and crying about a victimless crime without caring that hes been ripping off ny for over 50 years and 6 bankruptcies that destroyed lives businesses and stolen money from thousands of contractors and employees all while he laundered money through shell companies and sat on a golden toilet guess what trump is going to file next hint it starts with 7
not enough
yes yes yes pay up stable genius
trump must be tired of winning
i can vision bart simpsons bully friend nelson muntz pointing at trump with his famous catch phrase ha ha
there will be a price to pay for what these corrupt democrats are doing
when you spend your whole life pathologically trying to avoid being viewed as a loser well the law of attraction will ultimately help you become a giant loser
i think alina baba could fake this as a win for donald trump
a crooked judge a soviet show trial seventeen seventysix its going to be a bumpy ride patriots arise
time to up those merchandise fundraising and etc sales mr trump because we know you dont have this much cashmr im a billionaire
white collar crime at its best but now at his worst hes constantly inflated all of his properties to obtain money then devalued it to get tax breaks let this idiot assume the values then charge his deplorable self pay taxes on his of the chart assumptions of baked properties theg got him pls vote
dont do the crime if you cant do the time
we know he is a crook but the da is over reaching on this one huge corporations will only get fined 110 million this will probably get him reelected
everything he has ran is after the model of his fraud
maga they are turkeys begging for thanksgiving russia china and iran will hit usa next and trump will ask why vlad
he needs to pay his bills if he doesnt pay his bills biden should send him to russia or iran and we should encourage them to do whatever the hell they want
dear cnn news please investigate the following concept very carefully if we interpret the actions of russian president vladimir putin as the retaliatory assassination of alexey navalny for the ruling issued by the judge against donald trump this fundamentally requires an absolutely invasive digitally and materially present instance of espionage either within the inner circle of the judge their courthouse or the trump legal team the assassination happened immediately before the ruling and public knowledge of its contents details but during its time of being typed printed and controlled dissemination this meaning a russian presence is somewhere within the 24 hours prior to these very moments of today there is a russian spy operating either digitally or physically within the united states which has to be embedded within this new york civil fraud case if the russian spy is within the inner circle of the judge or the courthouse the people who have access to computers and documents is limited thus the presence should be easily detected if anybody realizes they need to go searching for it if however the russian spy is within contact to the trump legal team then we would have undeniable proof that donald trump is in contact with vladimir putin the former united states president is an asset to the present russian president is by all obvious accounts a traitor the immediate arrest and isolation of donald john trump for treason is warranted and his candidacy for a second term as president is forfeited if this does not proceed immediately then it is a conspiracy to allow it to continue on if not for by as an intelligence operation then as a systemic corruption to deny this egregious vulnerability of western democracy because if the russian spy is operating freely within the courthouse so as to meddle about where else in association to donald trump are they operating in america there could be multiple locations and branches of governments and places of law that are technically compromised here
pay up sucker
awesome news eff the trumps unrelate why do women do that thing with their voices when they are trying to be authoritative and basal where they sound like little kids pretending to be adults
the pendulum always swings the other way be careful you may hate trump today but it could be us tomorrow it the us tomorrow and we dont have that kind of money to fight the government this is so scary
wow well its about time pay up trump
should have been 500 million
are we tired of winning yet
leonard leo got 17 billion dollars of dark moneyto pay these kind of bills
nato countries will pay when he pays too
i love this
we stand with you trump
i wonder if this can be an added chapter in art of the deal
couldnt happen to a nicer narcissist
trump needs to force ivanka to give him some of that half a billion she and jared got from saudi arabia when in the wh
he will appeal and win this is such a joke he seems to alway win against simple minded democrats
are you a delinquent you gotta pay your bills donnie id encourage the court to do whatever it wants with you pay mofo
couldnt have happened to a crappier guy
perhaps trump will also pay juniors and the other ones fines out of his pocket like his father fred bailed him out no i dont think so either he will sell their homes to pay his
i laugh lets see how far this goes
my house is worth 5 billion dollars thats what i say you think a bank or some other entity is going to take my word for that this was a trumpd up case by a woman who ran on getting trump any way she could its all bogus
looks like frump is going through some things

he is a billionaire he can pay it right
now he needs ro pay his bills for once in his life the four stooges in there ull gotten gains needto pay up also
his identity what hilarious
got off easy again
well donnie this is the price you and your now defuncted company for messing around with justice and getting enriched
sir please were sick of winning
art of the raw deal
he still has his nfts and he can cut up his clothes his supporters would buy a piece of his suits ties etc probably not his soiled diaper
better call rudy
why is everyone smiling
hip hip hooray my only wish is that it wouldve been 355 billion
he hasnt paid anything yet
hes going to have to liquidate some of his assets and its going to be a forced sale means hell have to sell them at the lower end of market price right
price at the mara lardo buffet just went up
he aint paying a single cent keep dreaming cnn
if your going to uhh work in a uhhh business that is based in good umm oratory and speaking uhh and you umm cant do it find other work
so when doess scotus rule on this and overturn it and disbarr that judge and his lover letudhy james
thirty six month ban what are joke trump is laughing all the way to the bank

horrible day for america its becoming communist and hypocritical jealousy and hate should not be turned towards the best president the united states has had
trump and everyone around him do nothing but lose
lock up trump crime family
great news
he got off lightly
if rudy ever thought he was going to get paid he can forget it now

finally some justice for the american people now lock him up
the art of the spaghetti against the wall
only banned three years
3 year ban for trump doing business in nyc
come on donald pay your bills
hope this judge gets his comeuppance soon fuck new york they are failing in so many ways and the judge is old probably wont be able to enjoy his decision
another great news
trump for the people and the people for trump to save america from dangerous lunatic leftestwhat goes around comes back around ten fold this will make him stronger hell appeal and take all busines men out of nyc as well as business
they wont get a dime from president trump
hey desantis you paying attention you went after disney will you go after trump ifwhen or will you give him a pass or will you make fl citizens pay his bills
first aoc blew up the amazon deal with ny costing thousands of direct and indirect jobs and now an activist partisan judge has just turned the trickle of business leaving ny into a flood
does trump even have the money even if he liquidated all his real estate assets
if trump hasnt coughed up the damages within 7 days nato should be invited to do whatever the heck they like to maralago and every other trump property
judge you are fined a shit ton of money trump i see im going out to my car to get my checkbook
not a big enough of a fine putin will pay that bill he has the money

wonderful news just a start to hell
now judge its defamation time
tired of winning yet you old orange gross conman and liar
he will not be too worried as his maga morons will pay for most of it
yep this got me hard
so the judge recognizes a crook and fraud when he sees one
is the politburo ruling
trump is decomposing
the saddest part of all of this is that his supporters many of them who are on welfare will send what little they have to pay his legal bills it is insanity
he should fight it after all he turned a 5 million loss into nearly 80 million with that track record he can turn this into a 5 billion loss
i sure am glad that engoron took three months in a case the verdict of which was already decided and then delayed his decision in light of new evidence so that he could ultimately charge trump checks notes less than the da asked for and those fines for the boys brutal thats gotta eat into don jrs coke fund for the month
lying and cheating does have its consequences when its done on a maga scale
wow what a feeling this is to see citizen trump being held financially accountable to the tune of 355 million prison awaits him next cheers
a sham just and attack to try and bankrupt trump
ya baby hes a criminal folks do not reelect him use your brains people choose another candidate who does not grab women by their pu88ies mocks disabled people supports nato countries and someone who doesnt have several criminal charges against him ty folks all the very best to our awesome neighbours cheers from vancouver
dont forget donald this is on top of the 83 million you owe ms carroll no protection for you no you gotta pay up
a billionaire would have made that much money last year alone in the stock market so were talking about one years stock gains to put this in perspective
hey donnie financial relief is only one cap away bon appétit
the loser loses again the best loser no one can lose better thats what everyone says
this should be no problem for trump hes a billionaire
ha ha ha ha lot of zeros here
those 3 years off are more than enough to see him crumble into nothingness
the orange ahole may have to sell more classified secrets
you gotta pay your bills and you cant let people get away with bullshit donald j trump
good orange jesus is being judged go blue

citizen trump is a fraudster nato is having a good laugh tonight
i bet freddy tp is moaning in his grave
lecturing nato countries about paying bills what an absolute idiot he must have taken some semesters at trump business university on how to con people
sadly this probably wont bankrupt him or teach him a lesson
so tired of winning nobody knows more about winning than i doblah blah
all this winning
the teflon is flaking off
this is america now huh trump did alot more for america than his predecessors its very unfair and unjust this ruling judge should be investigatedwhy does everyone hate trump so much again what was it that he did to you or america that made our lives more difficult i cant find any reason all im saying no one knows enough about anything to pass such harsh judgment that is why this seems unfair while biden is way more corrupt and look at the money he gave away to pointless wars
wake me when the man actually starts paying until then i wont believe that rich men face actual consequences
interest on that judgment will go back to 2019 compounded
this evil by the devils god is watching god bless trump
time to empty the rnc chest the evangelist church money its needed for their hero luckily trumps sons wife will be managing the rnc money for the appeal but dont expect ever to see the money again evidence is overwhelming that trump is a fraud
thats ok the rnc will pay it for him
terrific news trump will be forced to stop scammingothers
sick situation
not harsh enough
smelly trump also had a ghost loan of 48 million on a set of his books the financial monitor retired judge barbara jones who was appointed by judge engoron to monitor the trump business finances the loan simply didnt exist but was on the books it was bad boy loan from trump to trump i think it was a forgiven loan by deutsche bank he kept on the books so he wouldnt have to pay taxes on it
i hope everyone keeps in mind that this investigation was only about 2 years of his fraud activity
maybe tumps friend vladimir putin can chip in a few dollars to help out a fellow wannabe dictator
in nba terms bang
in the past 90 days trump has been ordered to pay 4383 million dollars
the judge is a fooltrump will win his appeal and the presidency in 2024
now trump has to go to work with q anon to deny everything and immediately start fundraising from his cult members
his memory isnt good enough to stand trial so he should be set free we know if he was a democrat he would have been authoritarian leftist at it again that graves gonna be huge
ms habba donald trumps lawyer said that its better to be pretty than smart this is the verdict that pretty gets you lol
for those especially our elected officials who believe the charges against trump are bogus and a witch hunt prove their disregard and disrespect for our judicial systems thus showing disdain for our democratic institutions and processes
i just love this everything he owns will be sold at fire sale prices and he wont be able to buy a pack of gum it took waaaaay too long but it finally hit him in the ass
not even nato will help rump you got to pay your bills
crime family trump 354 million trump 4 million eric trump 4 million don trump jr pay up
not enough needs pay more for all he as done
how in the fuck do you get a 40 million loan with no paperwork what bank is handing out loans at that amount
oh boy the shit has hit the fan
im a lifelong democrat but im out this is a disgrace i will vote for trump in november
remember when traitor trump said he doesnt pay taxes because hes smart
oh poor donald another devastating loss to his name well he better get used to it and fast
the cult will continue to pay his bills
wow dj trump bend over and take the position
we all know nothing will be paid sad but true

very fine people i might add
slap on the hand
hahaha donald trump is going to get pissed alina habba is following the leader to become the big loser junior if trump is smart enough sue her for malpractice to recover some of the losses
trump will appeal i just hope he keeps using alina habba as his lawyer
donald u tired of winning yet
his pacs have only a few months worth of cash at his current legal burn rate and now hes out an additional 355m in pocket change he likely doesnt have on hand
sure sounds like cnn is on donald trumps side that is so sad
i like presidents who arent rapists and fraudsters
damn thats a lot of money
corrupted justice system
time for trump to scam his base for more money
great finally he gets what he has been deserving for for so many years as he has always been able in the past to get away with toooooo many wrong doing for years and years
it is such good news actually great news because finally finally finally after an entire lifetime of lying cheating dodging bribing stealing blackmailing spying pretense nepotism hypocrisy stupidity corruption incompetency bigotry dishonesty degeneration desecration thievery thuggery treachery griftingsexual assault and threatening lives of innocent people the chickens have finally come home to roost by far twice impeached and triple crown indictment winner with one to spare yeah hurray its good news for all freedom loving americans americans who are for law and order not like the gop who are outlaws and like disorder finally we should have a good mugshot of this career criminal with him holding a numbered board in front of his chest have they taken measurements for his orange suit yet now the thing to worry about will be that he will use all that stolen documents those national security confidential documents as a get out of jail free card for himself and his family
so the banks said there was nothing with the loans
so he lost a 75mil and a 3498mil defamation lawsuit back to back i only like winners i dont like losers
maga churches and his people your sonofagod needs more of your money please do not cut your children lunch allowances
trump on troth sential any moment now gimme some more money suckers i need it for my fin campaign
100 certain that he will not pay a cent i hope that the tax department now goes him for his back taxes owed america is so corrupt that will probably not happen
this is absurd and pure evil there was a disclaimer and there were no victims its all nasty political injustice and all the voters see that he should pay them in pennies then bulldoze the buildings to return nyc to the rat infested ghetto it was before he built it up what goes around always comes around tenfold
as captain tom said today is a good day trump will soon realise he is not above the law
judge go and pay that damn money at the cash register over there and get the hell out of my courtroom now
cadet bonespur is getting instant karma
now lets see if trump pays his legal obligations because he sure thinks nato doesnt he doesnt even pay his workers
i think i will be going to the pub tonight
three cheers for the fraudster conman drumpf
as a republican ive been donating a lot so far my children are a bit hungry but they will understand we need to rescue our billionaire president
the list of crimes are building now trump is a rapist in a court of law a fraud ina court of law trump is the worlds biggest conman lock this criminal up now
trump got off very lightly

why doesnt trump just have mexico pay it
he got off light they needed to be banned for life
trump is delinquent putin feel free to do whatever you want with him he cant pay his bills
when lara trump chairs the rnc money will be no problem for the trump family not saying anyone will get paid though
dont forget the interest on 10 years at 9 that will be added
republicans dig deep in your pockets
grab him by the pursey
if you dont pay your dues we wont defend you
he is fed
that is nothing trump will easily pay that amount because he is rich really really rich
looks like the magga cultists need to get their checkbooks out
love it
trump is a genius deal maker he got 15 million discount
nyc is closed for business for the trumpflake clan
in the united states civil fraud and criminal fraud are two distinct legal concepts that involve fraudulent activities but differ in terms of the nature of the proceedings the parties involved and the potential consequences civil fraud nature civil fraud refers to fraudulent activities that harm individuals or entities leading to financial losses or damages proceedings civil fraud cases are typically handled in civil court through lawsuits filed by the aggrieved party plaintiff against the alleged wrongdoer defendant burden of proof the burden of proof in civil fraud cases is usually lower than in criminal cases the plaintiff must establish the fraudulent activity by a preponderance of the evidence showing that it is more likely than not that fraud occurred penalties if the plaintiff prevails the defendant may be required to compensate the plaintiff for damages or losses in some cases punitive damages may also be awarded to deter similar conduct in the future government involvement civil fraud cases are generally brought by private individuals or entities however government agencies may also pursue civil fraud cases especially in matters involving fraud against the government criminal fraud nature criminal fraud involves fraudulent activities that violate criminal laws and the focus is on punishing the wrongdoer for criminal conduct proceedings criminal fraud cases are prosecuted by government authorities in criminal court the government prosecution brings charges against the defendant who is accused of committing a crime burden of proof the prosecution must prove the defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt which is a higher standard than the preponderance of the evidence used in civil cases penalties if convicted the defendant may face criminal penalties including fines probation restitution and imprisonment the severity of the penalties depends on the specific criminal statutes involved and the circumstances of the fraud government involvement criminal fraud cases are initiated and prosecuted by government authorities such as federal or state prosecutors individuals who commit criminal fraud may face charges brought by agencies like the fbi sec or other law enforcement entities in summary civil fraud involves private legal actions seeking compensation for damages while criminal fraud involves governmentinitiated prosecutions seeking to punish individuals for violating criminal laws the burden of proof penalties and the parties involved differ between civil and criminal fraud cases

beautiful just beautiful now lock him up
trump now owes over 1 billion in courtordered payments he will have to sell trump tower and maralago
let the ketchup fly

if chump isnt banned for life its all for nothing what a weak judge total weakness
another video i watched on this said the judge only made a 3 year ban on the real estate dealings not sure how accurate that was but it is just what the other video said
love this for him
if you have ever given money to trump just know that you have paid the dems and liberals now
all the winning making accountability great again one ruling at a time
trump please dont be delinquent in paying your lawsuits to everybody you owe
talking heads in msm are literally saying the banks made money so theres no victim what about the people of new york clowns

maralardo will be covered in ketchup today
trump need two ran thus contry like a biznesd
sucks to be trump
donald trump will be emailing he supporters for the moneys so no worry all maga lol
if he is delinquent and doesnt pay does that mean putin is going to deal with him
the crows are coming to roost right on drama donnies head
trump will soon ask all the morons who support him to pay the fine total conman not a successful businessman
congratulations to all the decent and honest americans justice has been served the nob boss and his criminal history are catching up with him

theres grifting and then theres trump grifting undisputed champs chris christie
i dont pay taxes bcs im smart 35500000000
should of gave a peaceful transfer of power and enjoy but too late cleaning
hes done
why not hold him in custody until he pays the bill he still hasnt paid the bills to cities run up by his rallies in the 2020 campaign
this pushes trump more firmly into putins grasp
lets seefraud 355 million plus other conditions83 million defammation casesstormy case going aheadtired of winning yet
wow insulting the judge and playing games in court didnt seem to work out so good bet that 92 page ruling is appeals proof
nobody is curious that all these cases just so happen to start when he is running for the presidency
the definition of winning must have changed i thought the winners always came away with the prize
appeal
trump sure knows how to get rid of money lmao biggest loser ever
should be a drop in the bucket right i mean hes claimed hes a billionaire or was that another costly lie
that should put a damper in his dipers
i wish the reporters would ask him about paying his bills when he wants our nato allies about paying their bills
no surprises there as the judge made up his mind from day 1 off to the appeal court
its funny that his girls are the ones smart enough to avoid crime
the children too
thats a lot of ketchup
2 billion still unaccounted for whats up with that
perhaps trump can ask putin for a loan
rapist trump will never have to pay the 355 the laws in the us are made by the rich and powerful to protect themselves laws only apply to average citizens
should be his entire wealth
that buys a lot of ketchup
it is already on appealso it willcome to nothing
what about alina
i guess the ga distraction tactic didnt work for this one
corrupt leftist judges in corrupt blue statestrump 2024
trump i used to be incredibly rich got any spare change i still owe alina habba money for costing me 4523 million in 3 lawsuit trials
this judge cannot be intimidated has he lost his mind trump is the next president silly move in my opinion i will never put my familys future in danger like he did they will come after him
such wonderful news indeed n almost got fell off from my chair i hope trump will pay assp to state of new york
now dissolve the company and turn trump tower in migrant holding
does this bar him from office
so much losing
another compromised dnc pedo judge
zelenskys passion of bonding with people thru comedy and songs has led him to this most important role for ukrainians and for a better world for goodness sake now is the time to stop tyrants striving for a dystopian world
happy friday donald have a great weekend
the devils are attacking stronger and stronger as november 2024 comes closer and closer they are afraid of trumps victory because they know it is real
he probably has the cash after scamming people for 60 years in some foreign bank
he can get it from jarrod and the saudis
ron edmonds
when you are a fraud and a criminal you get justice does donald have the assets or cash to be able to appeal the ruling will putin or ivanka be picking up that phone call new phone whos this
anybody noticed that conservatives are not whining about fraud when it comes to default donald but theyre targeting the da in georgia for the exact same thing man its almost like theyre being prejudiced toward her for particular reason i wonder what it could be
step right up and purchase some new nft cards from this traitor loser
apsmith1635 for 0 sekunder siden if he is not going to pay his bills we will not vote for him actually we will encurrage the judge to take away the last assets that he owns
when i say t r a i t o r you say t r u m p
you liberals celebrate your own destructionwe are now in state of conviction for non crimesamerica will fall
i like winning so much
money money money pay up donnie
are they still going to dissolve the trump org
sure says the trump hating judge all this is doing is bringing back to the white house wait and see this is just helping him
hahahahaha now i understand why trump is trying to install his family at the rnc hes gonna need a new bunch of suckers to scam to help pay for his criminal misdeeds lying
perghaps should donate that mone yto nato to the countries likwe the uk that are struggling to put 2 5 of their income into their army yes thats the 2 no one pays it anywhere
should have been a lifetime ban now america should ban trump forever vote blue
play stupid games win stupid prizes
its already been shown that the left extremists in governments will target peoples bank accounts
this is a significant covfefe moment for trump
cough it up trumpers
trump doesnt know the word honest
trump is such a horrible person so aye hes republican candidate
trump nobody above the law is time for you to pay you bills
lol thats hilarious
this isnt about revenge under trump his business diverted money ie stole banks dont have unlimited money the money lent to trump stopped institutions from lending to other worthy truthful people this is about him and his business not profiting from shady business practices and to discourage others from going down the same path
dont you think that youre pushing trump directly into putins arms d is bankrupt already and pu is someone who can save him
erik said he feels like he is living in an alternative universe finally erik sees reality
oh dear how sad never mind
weve always known trumps a liar and fraud now its just official
well i reckon he looks less orange tonight more like a red tomato guess membership fees for mar a lago golf will be going up
donald better start buying lotto tickets haha
yet biden is unfit for legal punishment but fit to be president how
governor gregg abbot can be trumps avenging angel no deal on border security let the migrants keep coming and have governor gregg abbot send as many migrants as he can muster to new york city donald trumpcontact governor abbot today and tell him to send 50000 more migrants to new york city tell him to keep sending as many more as he can muster send thousands and thousands of migrants to new york city if the mayor of new york city calls abbot can tell him thats what you get for messing with trump and hang up the phone
loser trump cant stop losing poor rnc will have to front that bill i bet they are regretting hitching their wagon to this lame horse
and the dominos begin to fall
received ticket for driving 120mph but i didnt crash this ticket is unfair
86 take a good look in the mirror america does trump have to pay if he dies
as judge judy would say perfect
get that money
at least this is a good first step to demonstrate that there is in fact accountability for trump and his enablers
chump change for ivanka jared with their saudi billions
this is a good thing
i like people that arent in infinite debt
only 355million thats all
donald fraud trump sounds fitting
so total of 440 million so far from the indictments lets gooooo
a fool and his money are soon parted
thank god he took so much money from people who trust him pay back is a bitch
we see the same judicial corruption in mexico today where judges are political hacks abusing the legal system
next he will demand nato to pay his fines
this makes me seriously doubt that trump knows anything about business and the economy
oh my the tidal waves of maga tears are about to break free everyone prepare for the flooding
when tucker carlson asked president putin if he invaded ukraine because biden is a weak and spineless president he laughed uncontrollably
what did trump say the other day you gotta pay your bills
double it and give it to the same person
next case justice matters
he now has massive debt let the ketchup hit the wall let the ketchup hit the walls
so you dont want to pay youre delinquent then the courts can do whatever the hell they want in fact i encourage it
cough it up fraudster
do not worry trump cult followers will pay for it
watch the support increase once again
swede here the courts in the us works democracy will prevail in the end never bet against the united states
oh god bout time
trump i just need you to find me 11780 more votes and while youre at it i need you to find me 355 million dollars which is 355 million more than i have
if he becomes president againgod help us we are in for rough ride
trump got 5 years his sons got 2 years ea cant do business on ny
look how happy they look glad cnn posts without bias
love it the next conservative in the white house will be from a party that does not yet exist the gop destroyed itself from within just as they are trying to do the usa
trump is the most dangerous person in the world putin is the second most dangerous person
yesguiltyand the rest will follow
the funniest part of this is the maga people who live in trailer parks giving their expert opinions about the real value of mara largo
the stupid trumpistas will pony up and save his ass
there goes djtjs rumble money
so are you tired of the winning yet
trump whining about nato lol the irony
is this a joke
this is what winning looks like for trump his cult followers
bet they already have the rush money to trump emai written and sent off
3rd world court system
wow thats a lot of dough
those maga idiots better start earning more money for their leader
with lara trump cochair of the rnc no problem hahahaha
lol bad news for his donors
glory glory hallelujah couldnt have happened to a more deserving set of people
thank you judge engoron its about time this life long conman and grifter be held financially accountable
trump is criminal
the judge gave him a gift this really sucks
what and ivana skates away for free
i guess hes going to have to sell trump tower to raise money i can see it now as his tower gets sold and renamed e jean carroll tower
waitso the trump business only gets three years in prison thats it ridiculous they should have been barred for at least 10 years
such great newsi hope to see that for sale sign on trump tower and mar a lago pretty soon
all his lies and bs adding up to 443 million so far losers keep losing
yes finally some justice xtra drinks tonightwhoohohoohoo
lol trump is such a loser
thats why he refused to release his taxes he knew his lifetime of fraud would be exposed if he did
finally
accountability for trump
i guess more money for the migrants in nyc
same way trump said about nato members you have to pay your bills it came back to him
the art of the deal
now put him in jail
about time
many people are saying that traitor trump is going to go through some things over the next few months
kangaroo court the fix was in ny has a special court division that deals with commercial fraud cases engeron isnt a judge in that division but maneuvered to have the case assigned to him and letitia james campaigned for office promising to get trump this is the stuff of a fascist banana republic thats how dems roll
didnt take long for cnn to jump all over this did they mention all the appeals that will take place
the irony wants nato to pay their bills but he doesnt
trump deserves that and more for being so ignorant and stupid
hallelujah now tell the da to go after more of these over entitled cheaters
i didnt vote for him but this will easily get overturned
trumpty dumpty sat on a wall trumpty dumpty wrote another really big check
best news ever but should have been barred for life
not tired of winning yet
sounds about right
thats why trump wants laura trump to have a place in the rnc and change up leadership he wants the rnc to pay his bills
please donate to a homeless bone spurs veteran
such bs and 1 sided ruling none of this will stick
horrid week for republicans lovin it
