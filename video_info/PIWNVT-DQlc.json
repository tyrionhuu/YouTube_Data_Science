ASKED ME IN THE  INTERVIEW AND I BELIEVE IT WAS  I TEND TO 15 IS WHAT I   REMEMBER. I KNOW THE   >> INVESTIGATORS, CORRECT?   >> AND WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON  THAT, NOW, WHAT I HAD NO CLUE  UNTIL PROBABLY THE END OF JUNE, THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT KIND OF OPENED MY EYES TO YOU KNOW,  SOMETHING'S GOING ON HERE SO  YOU GET THAT UNUSUAL REQUEST.  DID YOU EVER THINK TO YOURSELF  WHY WERE THERE SO MANY BOXES AT MAR-A-LAGO?   >> FOR ME. I'M JUST THINKING  OUT OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HE HAS A LOT OF STUFF HE LIKES  TO LUG AROUND WITH THEM. I  NEVER WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT WAS  ANNG LIKE WHAT WE SEE  TESTIFY JAKE IT IS JUST A   REMARKABLE MOMENT. KAITLAN   COLLINS AND I'VE BEEN REPORTING ON THIS STORY ALONG WITH THE   REST OF OUR TEAM, BUT REPORTING ON THIS STORY FOR, FOR SO LONG  IN THIS MOMENT IT IS SO   REMARKABLE TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT SPOKEN PUBLICLY  BEFORE, BUT CLEARLY JUST BY HIS PROXIMITY AND HIS LONG-STANDING TIME HI, GUYS AT THE FORMER   PRESIDENT'S CLUB WAS ABLE TO  PROVIDE SUCH VALUABLE  INFORMATION TO INVESTIGATORS  ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING HERE  WHILE HEAL, HE HIMSELF, JAKE  WAS STILL PIECING THIS ALL  TOGETHER BEHIND THE SCENES   >> KATELYN POLANTZ, MOTHER QUIT HIS JOB AT MAR-A-LAGO IN ABOUT  A YEAR-AND-A-HALF AGO IN LATE  2022. Y COME FORWARD TO SHARE  HIS STORY NOW HE SAYS THAT HE  JUST WANTS TO TELL THE TRUTH.  JAKE, THAT WAS ONE OF THEM   MESSAGES THAT CAME ACROSS LOUD  AND CLEAR FROM BRIAN BUTLER  WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING TO KAITLAN COLLINS EARLIER TODAY, ONE OF  THE THINGS THAT MAKES HIM SO  UNIQUE IN THIS SITUATION AS A  WITNESS IS THAT NOT ONLY THIS  WITNESS NOT ONLY IS HE TRUMP   EMPLOYEE FIVE IN THAT  INDICTMENT, BUT HE ALSO IS  SOMEONE WHO IS USING A  DIFFERENT LAYER TO REPRESENT  HIM IN THIS CASE, HE'S REFUSED TO TAKE ANY POSSIBLE BOILER  THAT THE TRUMP TEAM COULD  PROVIDE HIM AND USED SOMEWHAT  HE KNEW SEPARATELY AS HIS WAY  OF SETTING HIM APART. AND NOW  HIS REFLECTION UPON THIS, A PAD IN THE PAST LAST YEAR, THE FBI  APPROACHED HIM IN HIS DRIVEWAY  ABOUT A YEAR AGO, JUST THIS   DAY, HE SAYING THAT TRUMP IS  DIVIDING THE NATION. IT'S  DIVIDED RELATIONSHIPS. HE'S HAD WITH OTHERS AND JUST NOW HE'S  PUTTING THE PUZZLE PIECES  TOGETHER HERE.  >> AND KAITLAN COLLINS, DID MR. BUTLER'S SAY HE FELT ANY  PRESSURE AT ALL FROM TRUMP OR   MAR-A-LAGO OR ANYONE AFFILIATED WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO  NOT COOPERATE WITH SPECIAL  COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S TEAM IT  MAYBE NOT HAVE BEEN MAY NOT WAS EXPLICIT. IS THAT J BUT WHAT HE FELT PRESSURE ON WAS THE  ATTORNEY AND THE REASON THIS IS SO CRITICAL EGGS, THERE'S A  VERY CLEAR DIVIDE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS CASE OF WHO HAS AN  ATTORNEY THAT IS BEING PAID BY  TRUMP WORLD AND WHO IS PAYING  FOR THEIR OWN AND THE DIVERGENT PATHS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN ON  THIS MISLEY, CARLOS DE   OLIVEIRA, WHO WAS HIS VERY   CLOSE FRIEND THAT KAITLAN  MENTIONED THERE. HE HAS AN   ATTORNEY WHO IS BEING PAID FOR  BY TRUMP'S WORLD. HE IS  SOMEONE WHO WAS INDICTED IN  THAT SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT.  AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT THESE  TWO HAVE NOT SPOKEN SINCE THEN  HE WAS INDICTED IN THAT FOR   LYING TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS  ABOUT WHAT HE KNEW AND WHAT HE  SAW BRIAN BUTLER ON THE OTHER  HAND, SAID THAT HE FACED   REPEATED REQUESTS AND ATTEMPTS  TO TRY TO KEEP HIM IN THAT  TRUMP FOLD WHEN IT CAME TO  HAVING A TRUMP ATTORNEY ITSELF. AND SO I THINK THAT IS A  CRITICAL DISTINCTION HERE,  JAKE, AS WE'VE SEEN, HOW   PEOPLE WHO LEAVE THIS ORBIT AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. AND ONE  THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY  IMPORTANT IS THIS IS JUST A  REGULAR PERSON WHO WHO WAS   WORKING AT MAR-A-LAGO FOR 20   YEARS BY HAPPENSTANCE OF WHAT  HE SAW, WHAT HE WITNESSED, AND  WHAT HE WAS ASKED TO DO. HE HAS BECOME A WITNESS IN THIS  INVESTIGATION AND HAD FBI   INVESTIGATORS APPROACH HIM AND  SEEK HIM OUT. AND NOW HE HAS  SPOKEN TO THEM ON MULTIPLE  OCCASIONS, AS HE TOLD ME TODAY  DURING THIS REMARKABLE SIT DOWN FOUND THAT KAITLYN POLANTZ AND  I HAVE WITH HIM, HE SAID THAT,  YES, HE IS WILLING TO TESTIFY     SUMMER.   >> ALL RIGHT. KAITLAN COLLINS  AND KATELYN POLANTZ. THANKS SO  MUCH AND LOOK FOR MUCH MORE ON  THIS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW FROM  KAITLAN COLLINS IN JUST A FEW  HOURS ON HER SHOW. THE SOURCE  THAT'S TONIGHT AT NINE EASTERN HERE ON CNN. I WANT TO BRING IN CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR ELIE HONIG  TO DISCUSS ELIE, HOW IMPORTANT  IS THIS NEWS? HOW IMPORTANT IS  BRIAN BUTLER'S TESTIMONY FOR  THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S TEAM  BUILDING A CASE AGAINST TRUMP  AND HIS CO-DEFENDANTS. AND WAS  THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT AND WHAT  YOU HEARD HIM SAY, JUST THEM?   >> YEAH, JAKE SO THIS TYPE OF  WITNESS IS GOLD FOR PROSECUTORS AND THERE'S A FEW REASONS FOR  THAT. FIRST OF ALL, THIS PERSON HAS INSIDER ACCESS. HE IS  LITERALLY INSIDE THE ROOM AS  KAITLAN JUST LAID OUT. HE'S  THERE WHEN BOXES ARE BEING  LOADED ONTO THE PLANE AND ONE  OF THE CHALLENGES FOR  PROSECUTORS HERE IS EXPLAINING  EXACTLY WHERE THESE DOCUMENTS  WERE MOVED AND WHEN AND BY I  WHOM IN THIS PERSON CAN GIVE US EXACTLY WHY SECOND OF ALL,  HE'S A PERSON WHO APPEARS TO  BE UNBIASED. HE DOESN'T SEEM   TO HAVE ANY REASON TO HAVE AN  AX TO GRIND WITH DONALD TRUMP  AS KAITLAN SAID, HE'S A  LONGTIME TWO DECADES LONG  EMPLOYEE OF DONALD TRUMP AND  THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, JUST  BASED ON THE SNIPPET THAT WE  JUST SAW, HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANGRY OR RESENTFUL TOWARDS  DONALD TRUMP. FINALLY, IF YOU  LOOK AT HIS TESTIMONY AND YOU  LOOK AT THE INDICTMENT, HE   APPEARS TO BE WELL CORROBORATED BY DOCUMENTS BY CERTAIN TEXT  CHAINS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN  THE INDICTMENT AND BY TESTIMONY OF SOME OF THE DEFENDANTS   THEMSELVES, WALT NAUTA AND  CARLOS DE OLIVIERA. SO THIS IS  REALLY THE KIND OF WITNESS THAT YOU WANT TO BUILD AROUND AS A  PROSECUTOR SO WHAT'S THE BASIC WORTH OF HIS TESTIMONY? HE CAN  ESTABLISH THE BOXES CAME IN. HE WAS NOT TOLD THAT THEY WERE   VALUABLE, HAD IMPORTANT STATE   SECRETS IN THEM AND HE JUST  TREATED THEM LIKE ANYTHING   ELSE. AND THEY WERE STORED IN  COMMON AREAS AND NOT STORED  WITH ANY POTENTIAL SECURITY?   >> YEAH. I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT. I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY  DAMNING IN PARTICULAR TO WALT  NAUTA AND MR. DE OLIVERA, WHO  ARE BOTH DEFENDANTS IN THIS  CASE BECAUSE THEY'RE DIRECTING HIM WHAT TO DO WITH THE BOXES.  AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE  INDICTMENT, JAKE, THIS GUY, MR. WHOSE REFERENCED IN THE  INDICTMENT AS EMPLOYEE FIVE,  HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF OTHERS  THANKS TO HE'S A WITNESS  PRIMARILY, BUT FOR EXAMPLE,  WHEN IT COMES TIME TO TRY TO  CHECK OUT THE SURVEILLANCE  VIDEO, REMEMBER PART OF THIS  CASE IS THAT AT ONE POINT TRUMP AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS WERE   TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DO WE HAVE ON THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO? CAN WE DELETE IT? HE OVERHEARS  AND HE'S PART OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT AS WELL. SO I THINK  HE'S A MULTIFACETED WITNESS FOR PROSECUTORS   >> AND BUTLER DESCRIBES  MULTIPLE TIMES WAS OFFERED   ATTORNEYS PAID FOR BY TRUMP OR  THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. HE SAYS HE WAS REPEATEDLY TOLD HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK AND WORK FOR  TRUMP AS WELL AS OFFERED THINGS SUCH AS FREE GOLF TICKETS.  COULD ANY OF THAT BE SEEN AS  ATTEMPTS OF WITNESS TAMPERING?    >> SO THERE IS NO INDEPENDENT  CHARGE OF WITNESS TAMPERING IN  THE INDICTMENT HOWEVER, THAT  COULD STILL BE VERY VALUABLE  INFORMATION FOR PROSECUTORS TO  USE BECAUSE THE PATTERN IS  UNMISTAKABLE. WE'VE SEEN IT  AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THIS CASE,  IN OTHER TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS  THAT HE AND HIS ORGANIZATIONS  OFFER TO PICK UP THE LEGAL  BILLS THAT THEY SORT OF DANGLE  OTHER POTENTIAL REWARDS FOR  PEOPLE IF THEY STAY LOYAL. NOW  IT'S HARD TO CONNECT THAT  DIRECTLY IN A WAY WHERE IT CAN  CHARGE AND WE'VE NOT SEEN A   CHARGE HERE, BUT YOU CAN  ABSOLUTELY USE THAT AS A",

But the truth is, they wouldn\u2019t care even if they were fully cognizant of all the evidence. Republicans don\u2019t deal in good faith and haven\u2019t done so for at least 40 years. B/C what they are aware of is that they represent the minority. And as such, all they really care about is winning at any price. \nThis is why social security is in danger. This is why we don\u2019t have universal healthcare. This is why Ukraine is in danger and Taiwan is in desperate straits. This is why a two party system is scarcely better than a one party system. And this is why the electoral college is best game in town if you\u2019re a republican. \nLastly, I\u2019d just say that not all republicans are racists. But if you\u2019re a racist, chances are you\u2019re a republican.",

In August 2022, while Butler and De Oliveira enjoyed a long weekend with family at a Florida casino for Butler to celebrate his 40th birthday, Nauta reached out to Butler \u201cto make sure Carlos is good,\u201d prosecutors allege.\r\n\r\nButler assured Nauta twice that De Oliveira was loyal and wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt his relationship with Trump.\r\n\r\nProsecutors say Trump then called De Oliveira to tell him he would get his property manager a lawyer.\r\n\r\nButler and De Oliveira were at the casino\u2019s food court when that call came in, Butler recalls. De Oliveira hung up the phone, happily, and told Butler that Trump would provide him an attorney, Butler says.\n\nButler recounted the story to prosecutors and provided them access to his two cell phones.\r\n\r\nSince the Trump indictment, Butler has seen De Oliveira from afar in their neighborhood, and in news clips as his friend comes and goes from a federal courtroom.",

How can 3 Presidents walk out of there with classified and just hand it out? How is that even possible - MULTIPLE Times? How could they possibly have a functioning security office if idiotic civilians are allowed to just WALK OUT of SECURED AREAS with boxes of classified?\nYou can ask ANYONE that has a SECRET for Top Secret clearance and they will easily tell you that they must have an initial briefing where they sign a statement saying they will NEVER do those things. Then they have ANNUAL training on it EVERY YEAR. And then the security office actually does periodic inspections to ensure standards and procedures are being maintained. \nAnd yet for some reason at OUR NATIONS CAPITAL an orange civilian draft dodging moron was allowed to leave the Capital with BOXES of Top Secret data and just hand it out and sell it to anyone and that was years AFTER Hillary was an idiot with some lower level classified data. And after these 2 idiots have a turn being complete imbeciles then Biden takes his turn does it with lower level intel. \nIf any of the people I work with did anything WAY LESS to the stupidity that these 3 people did they would be FIRED and have their security classification rightfully REVOKED! \nWTF is going on at the Capital? IS THERE NO SECURITY OFFICE THERE? ARE THERE NO SECURITY PROCEDURES, NO POLICY, NO OVERSIGHT? \nDo we let every MORON in congress run around handing out Americas classified information and the classified info of our ALLIES? \nWHI ISN\"T THE NEWS REPORTING ON THAT MAJOR GOVERNMENT FAILURE?\nNow you combine that stupidity with the fact that on Jan 6 these same security rocket scientists allowed a mob of domestic terrorists (idiots actually, Trumpanzees and fools) to OVERRUN the Capital secured areas and steal peoples laptops and threaten the safety of all the decent people that work there. People DIED! \nWTF IS GOING ON WITH THIS COUNTRY THAT THIS CONTINUES TO OCCUR UNCHECKED AND GETTING WORSE? \nCapital security is obviously WORTHLESS and they all deserve to be FIRED immediately and the use of deadly force needs to be authorized and implemented to stop future occurrences.",

            "comment_text": "A longtime Mar-a-Lago employee who is a central witness in the investigation into former President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents is now speaking publicly because he believes that voters should hear the truth about his former boss and the case before the November election.\r\n\r\nBrian Butler, who is referenced as \u201cTrump Employee 5\u201d in the classified documents indictment brought by special counsel Jack Smith, told CNN in an exclusive interview that he doesn\u2019t believe the criminal case against Trump is a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d as the former president has claimed.\r\n\r\nButler gave testimony to federal investigators that informed crucial portions of last year\u2019s criminal obstruction charges against Trump and his two co-defendants, Walt Nauta, a personal aide to Trump, and Carlos De Oliveira, a property manager at Mar-a-Lago who had been Butler\u2019s closest friend until recently.\n\nButler, who was employed at Mar-a-Lago for 20 years, has spoken repeatedly with investigators, paying for his own attorney and breaking with the orbit around Trump that he knows so well \u2013 setting him apart from his former colleagues and friends as his former boss has been named in multiple federal investigations.\r\n\r\nButler told CNN how he unknowingly helped Nauta deliver boxes of classified information from Mar-a-Lago to the former president\u2019s plane in June 2022 \u2013 the same day that Trump and his attorney were meeting with the Justice Department at Mar-a-Lago about the classified documents.\r\n\r\nThat day, June 3, 2022, Butler received what he remembers as a strange request from Nauta, who wanted to know if he could borrow an Escalade from the car service Butler ran for Mar-a-Lago. Trump and his family were about to fly to New Jersey that day for the summer, and it was typically Butler and his valets who handled getting their luggage onto the plane.\r\n\r\nBut it was an unusual request from Nauta for the car, Butler says, because Nauta typically didn\u2019t handle moving luggage and asked Butler for the car in a guarded way.\r\n\r\nButler says Nauta and De Oliveira loaded up the vehicle before driving it to the West Palm Beach airport. Butler arrived with his own car filled with Trump family luggage, then helped Nauta load Trump\u2019s plane with the luggage \u2013 as well as bankers boxes of documents that were in the Escalade. Butler says he didn\u2019t realize the bankers boxes contained anything out of the ordinary.\n\nThree months after the FBI removed hundreds of government records from Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, Butler left his job as a club valet and manager, in part due to a growing restlessness to move on.\r\n\r\nButler says he has considered for months going public about his role in the obstruction case against Trump as he has carefully followed developments in the criminal case. Butler says he decided to sit down with CNN exclusively in West Palm Beach on Monday out of a wish to tell the truth and share what he knows to those who may doubt the facts of the case.\n\nButler, who has not previously been named publicly, is referenced six times in the Justice Department\u2019s indictment as \u201cTrump Employee 5.\u201d The references made to Butler in the indictment capture only an inkling of what he knows and could be asked to speak about on the witness stand \u2014 all of which he says he\u2019s already shared with prosecutors, giving them a window into scenes where other witnesses may have been close-lipped or allegedly misleading.\r\n\r\nButler also was a witness in the room to several conversations that allegedly capture how Trump was positioning his closest aide Nauta, De Oliveira and others to thwart federal authorities.\r\n\r\nDe Oliveira told Butler, for instance, about Nauta traveling to Palm Beach in late June 2022, at a time when Nauta and De Oliveira were allegedly interested in deleting surveillance tapes of a storage room where the boxes had been kept at the club, according to the indictment.\r\n\r\nButler recalls that De Oliveira told him Nauta would be visiting. Then a day later, De Oliveira warned Butler that Nauta\u2019s visit should be kept secret. De Oliveira told Butler that Nauta was interested in learning about how surveillance footage from the club would be saved \u2013 another oddity to Butler, he says.\r\n\r\nHe says he now looks back at his last few months at Mar-a-Lago with a clarity only the indictment of Trump could bring. The behavior of Trump and Nauta toward him \u2013especially on days where investigators were seeking details from Trump \u2013 now make sense, like puzzle pieces that have come together, Butler says.\n\nButler, 41, is a natural narrator of the world of Trump in South Florida.\r\n\r\nHe has known Trump since 2002 and can recount detailed conversations with him, his family and guests at Mar-a-Lago. Butler worked alongside his closest friends at the club, first and foremost De Oliveira. The two would sing karaoke together or celebrate each other\u2019s birthdays off property.\r\n\r\nBecause of his close-knit friendships, Butler has years of text messages and photos on his cell phone. His time as a chauffeur to countless visitors and Trump family members provided deep insight into the inner workings of Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe Florida native took the job working for Trump 21 years ago, as a seasonal valet at Mar-a-Lago making little over $30,000 a year. A man bubbling with ideas and energy, Butler pitched Trump personally a few years later about starting a car service for travelers visiting Trump properties in South Florida. It\u2019s one of several businesses Butler has started to support his family.\r\n\r\nThe Mar-a-Lago car service grew into a major part of his life for a decade, eventually earning him more than three times his initial salary, he says, and empowering him as an entrepreneurial spirit who grew close to many in the social network around Trump.\r\n\r\nBut the MAGA approach to politics in recent years, the intensifying FBI investigation, and Trump\u2019s apparently cavalier attitude toward national security soured Butler on staying at his Mar-a-Lago job after Trump\u2019s presidency.\r\n\r\nDisillusioned with how the club had grown into a more transactional environment for Trump during his presidency, Butler quit Mar-a-Lago in November 2022. That year, he watched his friends and former co-workers\u2019 lives become disrupted because of the developing criminal case.\r\n\r\nButler says now he believes Trump hasn\u2019t just divided the country. He has also divided people\u2019s communities, including his own two-decade relationship with his best friend De Oliveira.",

            "comment_text": "\"Oklahoma LGBTQ suicide prevention line sees more than 230% increase in calls since Nex Benedict\u2019s death\" - By Justin Gamble - Hey Justin Gamble, how many of those garbage calls would you take before quitting your job at CNN?\r\n\r\nBias Score: 6/10\r\n\r\nHelped:\r\n- The Rainbow Youth Project USA may benefit from increased visibility and support.\r\n- LGBTQ youth in Oklahoma may receive more attention and support.\r\n\r\nHurt:\r\n- The article may indirectly harm the reputation of Owasso High School and the broader Owasso community by associating them with the incident without presenting their side.\r\n- Oklahoma state policies and officials could be perceived negatively due to the framing of their actions in the article.\r\n\r\nLanguage:\r\n- Words like \"crisis,\" \"scared,\" \"worried,\" \"hurting,\" and \"fear\" evoke a strong emotional response and may be seen as biased toward generating sympathy for the LGBTQ youth.\r\n- Describing the political situation as \"just hate and loathing\" employs emotionally charged language that may not fairly represent all viewpoints.\r\n\r\nViewpoints:\r\n- The article predominantly features viewpoints sympathetic to the LGBTQ community and does not appear to include responses or perspectives from school officials, state lawmakers, or those with opposing views on the legislation mentioned.\r\n- Although it references investigations by police and the US Department of Education, it does not detail any findings or statements from these entities.\r\n\r\nFacts vs. Opinion:\r\n- The article presents factual information regarding the increase in crisis calls, the death of Nex Benedict, and state policies. However, the interpretation of these facts and the causality implied (e.g., linking Nex\u2019s death to the spike in calls) leans more on speculation or opinion without clear evidence provided in the text.\r\n- Statements from organizational representatives are presented as fact, with little distinction made between these perspectives and the article's narrative voice.\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n- The article might lack context on any existing support structures within Oklahoma or efforts made by the state or school to address LGBTQ concerns, potentially painting an incomplete picture.\r\n- The broader social and political climate in Oklahoma and its impact on LGBTQ youth is mentioned but not explored in-depth.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n- The primary sources are representatives from LGBTQ advocacy groups. The lack of diversity in sources (e.g., school officials, state lawmakers, directly affected individuals) might contribute to a one-sided narrative.\r\n- The reliability of the sources used is not in question, but their perspectives may not encompass the full spectrum of views on the issue.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThe article focuses heavily on the impact of Nex Benedict\u2019s death on LGBTQ youth in Oklahoma, painting a picture of increased fear and need for support within this community. While it effectively highlights the challenges faced, it does so with a clear bias towards the perspectives of LGBTQ advocacy groups and does not adequately represent opposing viewpoints or the responses from the school or state officials involved. The emotional language used and the selective presentation of facts contribute to a narrative that strongly advocates for one side of a complex issue.",
