As a simple people who have been all my life and in the meantime I am a simple people, I gave my approval to the National Banks that I never benefited from the various types of wealth because I have seen all the time the affairs of mine and the only thing I had in my hand was the approval for the National Bank, while the whole hemisphere does not know how you could have been when we handed over the compensation to Mr. Klodian Kili, that you may have been even more of us who gave approval to the National Banks, and who may have set aside some of your personal economic benefits of various assets because you may have worked mentally with developments from the most different that you may have taken here and there with forms from the most different, but it's a shame Lumadhi that he couldn't enjoy them.\nSignature: Klodian Kilai\n                         With respect: Klodian Kilai memorial for Mr. Klodian Kili",

It took me over two years of being in the market, I'm really grateful I found one source to recover my money, at least $10k profits weekly. Thanks Mrs Jenifer Jones",

Jesus Christ is returning soon, an if you want to be rapture ready, its pretty simple. 1. believe that Jesus died on the cross and spilled his own blood for are sins, was buried and rose on the third day from the dead in glory. 2. admit your a sinner and your need him to save you. 3. repent your sins on him and in faith and trust and believe in him to save you. Because as Scripture say. there be people left behind to face gods wraith and face the mark of the beast. were a person will have it on there right hand or forehead. so if you stay behind don\u2019t take the mark satay in faith to Jesus. For this time will be hell on earth. but if you do get left you still get saved just believe in what Jesus did and do good and die for him in this time. Lucifer will force you to take it. Do not accept it choose death. i pray you and many get saved and my fellow christians spread the word. Jesus loves us and nothing can separate us from him and faith and grace gets us saved. salvation and eternal life is a free gift from god nothing we earned or gained. Please it is important to spread this message to many. Jesus is your only way to avoid it. the signs are showing, more disasters and wars and suffering has increase dramatically. i pray to all see the true and believe. not to mention the ellipses on April 8 maybe the final waring. lord watch all and take all and open there hearts to Jesus Christ amen",

This is anarcho-tyranny, as Sam Francis dubbed it.\r\n\r\nThere is no threat to \"mosques, faith schools and community centres\" in the UK. Nobody is trying to attack them. Most British people would probably be too scared to break wind, even silently, in the vicinity of a mosque, for fear of being arrested for some kind of hate crime.\r\n\r\nIn actual fact, the threats to national security and the majority are far more likely to lie within these places. But the government's definition of national security is not your definition or mine. Common sense and basic pattern recognition don't come in to it. The government wants to clamp down on the right, which is the only popular force capable of challenging its abysmal record on immigration, demographic change and a whole host of other social, political and economic issues. \r\n\r\nSo that's why they're spending \u00a3117 million: to conjure a non-existent threat into existence. The fact that they've spent the money will be used as justification for further extension of state power to combat \"extremism\" -- and by \"extremism\", of course, they mean us.",
