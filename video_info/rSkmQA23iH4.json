Kids fighting on the bus could count as &quot;distracted driving&quot; but I doubt it, school bus drivers deal with that on a daily basis and usually don&#39;t crash. <br><br>There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s increasingly common for authorities not to call them &quot;accidents&quot; any more because they&#39;re almost always caused by someone doing something stupid.",
