    "video_transcript": "DOES FIND THE PRESIDENT LIBEL. WE'LL SEE WHAT THAT MEANS.  >> Martha: THANKS, ERIC. WE DO HAVE THIS DECISION. WE'RE WAITING FOR THE CONTENT OF IT. IT'S 92 PAGES LONG. IT'S NO PRICE THAT JUDGE ENGORON HAS FOUND THE FORMER PRESIDENT,  DONALD TRUMP, LIBEL IN THIS  CASE. THIS IS A CIVIL CASE. THERE IS ABOUT MONEY, NOT  CRIMINALITY. JUST TO REWIND A LITTLE BIT  HERE. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CASES TO KEEP TRACK ON. IN THIS CASE, LETITIA JAMES SAID WHEN SHE WAS RUNNING FOR  ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT SHE WAS  GOING TO GET TRUMP. WE'LL PLAY WHAT SHE SAID. THE DECISION IS IN. IT'S 92 PAGES LONG. JAMES ASKED FOR $370 MILLION IN  DAMAGES. SHE WANTS HIM TO BE PREVENTED  FROM DOING BUSINESS IN NEW YORK  STATE. SO AS WE WAIT TO DOWNLOAD ALL OF THIS AND GET A LOOK AT THE  NUMBER AND AS SOON AS WE GET IT, WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE  FORMER PRESIDENT IS WATCHING  CLOSELY. HE HAS LAYERS OF JUDICIAL DATES, APPOINTMENTS, DECISIONS COMING  DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE  SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY, WHICH IS COMING UP FEBRUARY 24 AND SUPER  TUESDAY. SO ALL OF THIS INTERWOVEN FOR  FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. I WANT TO BRING IN ARI  FLEISCHER, THE FORMER WHITE  HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY AND FOX  NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SHANNON  BREEN, OUR CHIEF LEGAL  CORRESPONDENT. SHANNON, LET'S START WITH YOU. NO SURPRISE OBVIOUSLY THAT HE  WAS FOUND LIBEL. THE JUDGE FOUND HIM LIBEL BEFORE THE CASE BEGAN. CORRECT? >> CORRECT. I JETTED TO THE BOTTOM TO SEE  WHAT WE COULD FIND. THERE'S SEVERAL BIG NUMBERS IN  THERE. THE JUDGE TALKS ABOUT IN THIS  FINDING DONALD TRUMP, DONALD  TRUMP JR. AND ERIC TRUMP AND  ALAN WEISSELBERG AND OTHERS  INVOLVED. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE  ORDERS IS THAT SEVERAL OF THEM  TOGETHER INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP  AND HIS TRUST AND TRUMP  ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE TO PAY  $168 MILLION AND CHANGE. THE NEXT PARAGRAPH SAYS THAT  THERE'S ANOTHER RULING FOR $126  MILLION AND CHANGE. ANOTHER ONE FOR $60 MILLION. WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AND SEE IF  THEY'RE OVERLAPPING OR IF WE ADD THEM UP. THESE ARE THE NUMBERS COMING  OUT. DONALD TRUMP JR., $4 MILLION IN  ONE CASE AND ALLEN WISELEBURG A  MILLION DOLLARS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF NUMBERS  THERE. WE'LL PARSE THROUGH THE NUMBERS. THEY'RE BIG. THERE WAS A BIG ASK. LOOKS LIKE THEY MAY BE IN THE  NEIGHBORHOOD OF CLOSE TO $300  MILLION OR MORE. >> Martha: WE'RE SEEING THIS. I BELIEVE THIS IS A REUTER'S  REPORT. WE'RE STARTING TO BALANCE UP THE NUMBERS HERE. ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE  REPORTING OUT THERE, THE NUMBER  IS $354.9 MILLION. AS YOU SAY, THE DAMAGES ARE  SPREAD ACROSS A NUMBER OF THE  TRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE  DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS. DON JR., ERIC TRUMP, $4 MILLION. PERHAPS EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY,  ACCORDING TO THE EARLY REPORTING THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE, THE  JUDGE HAS BANNED DONALD TRUMP  FROM SERVING AS AN OFFICER OR  DIRECTOR OF ANY NEW YORK  CORPORATION OR OTHER LEGAL  ENTITY IN NEW YORK FOR THREE  YEARS IS THE PERIOD HERE ON  THIS. NOW, THAT WOULDN'T HAVE A LOT OF IMPACT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND  HOPES TO BE PRESIDENT DURING  THAT TIME. ERIC TRUMP AND DON JR. AND ERIC  IN A LARGE WAY ARE VERY  INSTRUMENTAL IN BUSINESS HERE. IT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM  SERVING AS AN OFFICER OR  DIRECTOR OF ANY NEW YORK  CORPORATION OR OTHER LEGAL  ENTITY IN NEW YORK FOR TWO  YEARS. SO $355 MILLION HERE IN THE  JUDGMENT FROM ARTHUR ENGORON  AGAINST THE FORMER PRESIDENT,  DONALD TRUMP. ARI, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO  THIS? >> MARTHA, I JUST HAVE A HARD  TIME SEEING ANY OF THE COURT  CASES INCLUDING THIS ONE AS  ANYTHING OTHER THAN A  CONTINUATION OF THE RESISTANCE  THAT BEGAN WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT AND INSTANTLY  PROTESTERS TOOK TO THE STREETS  OF FIFTH AVENUE. LOOK AT ALL OF THESE CASES. THEY'RE BEING BROUGHT AGAINST  THE FORMER PRESIDENT IN THE  BLUEST OF BLUE COUNTIES ACROSS  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE IF THEY WERE BROUGHT IN  A PURPLE COUNTY LET ALONE A RED  COUNTY, THEY WOULD HAVE NO  CHANCE OF SUCCESS WHETHER IT WAS A JURY OR A JUDGE. I THINK THIS IS A CONTINUATION  OF THE NASTINESS THAT LAW HAS  TURNED INTO TO SERVE THE  POLITICAL ENDS AS LETITIA JAMES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF  NEW YORK, CAMPAIGNED ON GETTING  DONALD TRUMP. I REMEMBER WHEN SHE SAID THAT. I'M A NEW YORKER. I REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS A  CANDIDATE AND SHE VOWED TO DO  THAT. IT STRUCK ME AS A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE THEN AND NOW THAT SHE'S  DELIVERED ON IT, IT'S AN EVEN  BIGGER MISCARRIAGE. >> THIS ALSO -- THE JUDGE SAYS  THAT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION MUST INSTALL AN INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR  OF COMPLIANCE AND SAYS THE  INDEPENDENT MONITOR SHALL  CONTINUE IN HER ROLE, IT SAYS,  FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS. SHANNON, YOU KNOW, OF ALL THE  CASES THAT HAVE COME AGAINST THE FORMER PRESIDENT, THIS ONE I  WOULD SAY AND THE HUSH MONEY,  STORMY DANIELS CASE, WAS  PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF THE  INTERPRETATION OF A LOT OF  PEOPLE THAT STUDY THE LAW AS YOU DO. IN THIS CASE, NONE OF THE BANKS  CAME FORWARD. NONE OF THESE REAL ESTATE  INVESTMENT COMPANIES CAME  FORWARD AND SAID THAT THE TRUMP  ORGANIZATION FAILED TO REPAY  THEM. THEY CLAIMED THAT MAR-A-LARGO  ESTATE, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS WORTH  $18 MILLION, WHICH IS  PREPOSTEROUS FOR ANYBODY THAT -- >> I'D LOVE TO GET IN ON THAT.  >> YOU COULDN'T GET A COTTAGE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THAT KIND  OF MONEY. SO IT'S REALLY SHOCKING HOW  POLITICAL THIS APPEARS TO BE IN  GOING AFTER HIM. LET'S PLAY THOSE LETITIA JAMES  COMMENTS WHEN SHE WAS RUNNING TO BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. WATCH THIS. >> NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW  INCLUDING THIS ILL LEGITIMATE  PRESIDENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING INTO THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL EVERY DAY SUING HIM, DEFENDING YOUR  RIGHTS AND GOING HOME. >> I SAY ONE NAME, DONALD TRUMP. THAT SHOULD MOTIVATE YOU. >> WILL YOU SUE HIM FOR US? >> OH, WE'RE GOING TO DEFINITELY SUE HIM. WE'RE GOING TO BE A REAL PAIN IN THE [BLEEP]. HE'S GOING TO KNOW MY NAME.  >> Martha: EVERY TIME I SEE  THAT, SHOCKING BEHAVIOR FROM  SOMEONE THAT WANTS TO BE AN  ATTORNEY GENERAL. >> YEAH. THE LINE SHE HAS ABOUT NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW, HIS FOLKS WILL  SAY NOBODY IS BELOW IT EITHER. YOU CANNOT USE THE LAW AS A  CUJOLE. THIS GOES TO THE ARGUMENT THE  PRESIDENT MAKES. IT'S NOT JUST A PROSECUTION. THEY'RE PERSECUTIONS AND HIS  BALI RALLY TO THAT EVERY TIME. AS YOU NOTED THERE AND AS HE  CONTINUES TO NOTE, THERE WEREN'T VICTIMS HERE. THERE WEREN'T PEOPLE THAT  DEMANDED JUSTICE FROM THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL. IN NEW YORK EVEN THOUGH WE'RE  REFERRING TO THIS AS THE SUPREME COURT, THEY HAVE UNUSUAL  LANGUAGE THAT THEY USE IN  NEW YORK. IT'S NOT THE FINAL COURT OF  APPEALS. THEIR COURT OF APPEALS IS ABOVE  THEIR STATE SUPREME COURT. THE TRUMP TEAM FEELS LIKE THAT  THEY HAVE A REALLY STRONG  MEASURE ON APPEAL. NO DOUBT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO  TAKE EVERY PENNY OF THIS TO  APPEAL. SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MEANTIME? A LOT HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD  TAKING THE BUSINESS LICENSES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. WE'LL SEE HOW THEY DO ON APPEAL. NO DOUBT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE  GOING TO DO. >> Martha: ARI, WHEN YOU VALUATE YOUR OWN PROPERTIES FOR THE  PURPOSE OF INSURANCE OR THE  PURPOSE OF GETTING A LOAN FROM A BANK, IT COMES WITH LANGUAGE  THAT SAYS THIS IS OUR ASSESSMENT AND THE BANKS DO THEIR  ASSESSMENTS ON HOW MUCH THE  PROPERTY IS VALUED. IN NONE OF THOSE CASES INVOLVING THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION DID ANY  OF THESE PARTIES BRING ANY  LITIGATION AGAINST THE TRUMP  ORGANIZATION FOR ANY FALSE  REPRESENTATION. CORRECT? >> NO, THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. NOBODY HAS EVER ACCUSED ANY OF  THESE NEW YORK BANKERS OR  INSURANCE PEOPLE OF BEING BEHIND THE BALL. THESE GUYS ARE SHARP. THEY KNOW HOW TO SHARPEN THEIR  PENCILS. ALL OF THIS IS WHY I PUT THIS IN THE POLITICAL CATEGORY, NOT A  LEGAL CATEGORY. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THE  NORMS HAVE BROKEN DOWN IN THIS  COUNTRY. WHEN THE DEMOCRATS GO TO THESE  KINDS OF RESORTS TO GET SOMEBODY THEY DON'T LIKE, WE ALL LOSE  FAITH IN THE SYSTEM. IT'S THE SAME THING AS TWO  IMPEACHMENTS THAT VIOLATED THE  RULES OF THE HOUSE. ALL TO GET THE MAN THEY DON'T  WANT. THE PERVERSE RESULT OF IT IS  THEY'LL GET THE MAN THEY DON'T  WANT. AS A RESULT, DONALD TRUMP LEAP  FROGGED IN THE REPUBLICAN  NOMINATION. IF THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF  TRUMP, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE  PROSECUTED HIM AND RON DESANTIS  MAY HAVE HAD A CHANCE BACK IN  JANUARY OF 2023. THESE INDICTMENTS LED TO THE  RALLYING OF THE BASE BECAUSE OF  THE WAY PEOPLE QUESTION JUSTICE, WHICH HAS BEEN A FOUR-YEAR  PATTERN WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS  PRESIDENT. IT'S THE MOST FOOLISH THING THE  DEMOCRATS COULD DO UNLESS THEY  WANT HIM TO RETURN TO POWER. >> Martha: YOU'RE SO RIGHT. IGNORING THIS MIGHT HAVE  PRODUCED A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. YOU THINK ABOUT 91 INDICTMENTS  AGAINST THIS INDIVIDUAL. SHANNON, LOOKING AT OTHER CIVIL  CASES WHICH HAVE A MONETARY  PRICE TAG ON THEM. THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL CASE  HERE. I LOOKED BACK. O.J. SIMPSON WAS FOUND LIBEL IN  THE DEATHS OF TWO PEOPLE, HIS  WIFE AND NICOLE BROWN AND HER  FRIEND. $33 MILLION. IN THE DEATHS OF TWO HUMAN  BEINGS IN ONE OF THE MOST HIGH  PROFILE CASES IN AMERICAN  HISTORY. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? >> THEY WERE CLEARLY VICTIMS IN  THAT CASE, WHICH GOES BACK TO  THE ARGUMENT THAT NOBODY  COMPLAINED. EVER GOT PAID BACK. SO REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL  ABOUT THE OUTCOME, WHEN THE  PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT AND  HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE THIS  ARGUMENT THAT IT'S POLITICAL, IT LOOKS THAT WAY, ESPECIALLY WITH  THE CLIPS YOU PLAYED EARLIER. SOMETHING INTERESTING TO KNOW. WE HAD OUT NOW FOX POLLING THIS  WEEK. YOU AND I HAVE TALKED TO FOLKS  IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA AND  EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN THAT SAID  THEY WOULD NOT MOVE AWAY FROM  PRESIDENT TRUMP IF HE WAS  INDICTED OR CONVICTED. THERE IS SOME SOFTENING THERE IF HE'S CONVICTED ON A CRIMINAL  CHARGE. THIS NEW POLLING THERE WE HAVE  OUT OF CRITICAL STATES,  NEW HAMPSHIRE AND MICHIGAN THIS  WEEK, FOUND THAT MORE BIDEN  SUPPORTERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIS MENTAL ACUTIE THAN TRUMP  SUPPORTERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIS LEGAL ISSUES. THIS WILL RALLY MOST OF THE BASE TO HIM. IT FORCED ALL OF HIS GOP RIVALS  TO RUN TO HIS DEFENSE EVERY TIME HE WAS INDICTED. AS ARI POINTS OUT, IT CLEARED  THE FIELD IN A DIFFERENT WAY. VOTERS SAY FOR THE MAJORITY, IT  WON'T MOVE THEM. THEY WON'T WAIVER IN THE FACE OF VERDICTS LIKE THIS.  >> Martha: YOU'RE RIGHT,  SHANNON. THERE'S NO END  -- INDICATION  THIS HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT, IF  ANYTHING, IT HAS A POSITIVE  IMPACT. WHEN THEY SEE HIM UNDER ATTACK,  THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE  TO BE UNDER THE THUMB OF THE  GOVERNMENT OR OF THE LAW IN ONE  WAY OR THE OTHER AND T DOES FIND THE PRESIDENT LIBEL. WE\u2019LL SEE WHAT THAT MEANS. >> Martha: THANKS, ERIC. WE DO HAVE THIS DECISION. WE\u2019RE WAITING FOR THE CONTENT OF IT. IT\u2019S 92 PAGES LONG. IT\u2019S NO PRICE THAT JUDGE ENGORON HAS FOUND THE FORMER PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP, LIBEL IN THIS CASE. THIS IS A CIVIL CASE. THERE IS ABOUT MONEY, NOT CRIMINALITY. JUST TO REWIND A LITTLE BIT HERE.

I THINK THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE NASTINESS THAT LAW HAS TURNED INTO TO SERVE THE POLITICAL ENDS AS LETITIA JAMES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK, CAMPAIGNED ON GETTING DONALD TRUMP. I REMEMBER WHEN SHE SAID THAT. I\u2019M A NEW YORKER. I REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS A CANDIDATE AND SHE VOWED TO DO THAT. IT STRUCK ME AS A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE THEN AND NOW THAT SHE\u2019S DELIVERED ON IT, IT\u2019S AN EVEN BIGGER MISCARRIAGE. >> THIS ALSO -- THE JUDGE SAYS THAT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION MUST INSTALL AN INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR OF COMPLIANCE AND SAYS THE INDEPENDENT MONITOR SHALL CONTINUE IN HER ROLE, IT SAYS, FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS. SHANNON, YOU KNOW, OF ALL THE CASES THAT HAVE COME AGAINST THE FORMER PRESIDENT, THIS ONE I WOULD SAY AND THE HUSH MONEY, STORMY DANIELS CASE, WAS PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF THE INTERPRETATION OF A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT STUDY THE LAW AS YOU DO. IN THIS CASE, NONE OF THE BANKS CAME FORWARD. NONE OF THESE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT COMPANIES CAME FORWARD AND SAID THAT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION FAILED TO REPAY THEM. THEY CLAIMED THAT MAR-A-LARGO ESTATE, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS WORTH $18 MILLION, WHICH IS PREPOSTEROUS FOR ANYBODY THAT -- >> I\u2019D LOVE TO GET IN ON THAT. >> YOU COULDN\u2019T GET A COTTAGE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY. SO IT\u2019S REALLY SHOCKING HOW POLITICAL THIS APPEARS TO BE IN GOING AFTER HIM. LET\u2019S PLAY THOSE LETITIA JAMES COMMENTS WHEN SHE WAS RUNNING TO BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. WATCH THIS. >> NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW INCLUDING THIS ILL LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING INTO THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL EVERY DAY SUING HIM, DEFENDING YOUR RIGHTS AND GOING HOME. >> I SAY ONE NAME, DONALD TRUMP. THAT SHOULD MOTIVATE YOU. >> WILL YOU SUE HIM FOR US? >> OH, WE\u2019RE GOING TO DEFINITELY SUE HIM. WE\u2019RE GOING TO BE A REAL PAIN IN THE [BLEEP]. HE\u2019S GOING TO KNOW MY NAME. >> Martha: EVERY TIME I SEE THAT, SHOCKING BEHAVIOR FROM SOMEONE THAT WANTS TO BE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL. >> YEAH. THE LINE SHE HAS ABOUT NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW, HIS FOLKS WILL\nSAY NOBODY IS BELOW IT EITHER. SAY NOBODY IS BELOW IT EITHER. YOU CANNOT USE THE LAW AS A CUJOLE. THIS GOES TO THE ARGUMENT THE PRESIDENT MAKES. IT\u2019S NOT JUST A PROSECUTION. THEY\u2019RE PERSECUTIONS AND HIS BALI RALLY TO THAT EVERY TIME. AS YOU NOTED THERE AND AS HE CONTINUES TO NOTE, THERE WEREN\u2019T VICTIMS HERE. THERE WEREN\u2019T PEOPLE THAT DEMANDED JUSTICE FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. IN NEW YORK EVEN THOUGH WE\u2019RE REFERRING TO THIS AS THE SUPREME COURT, THEY HAVE UNUSUAL LANGUAGE THAT THEY USE IN NEW YORK. IT\u2019S NOT THE FINAL COURT OF APPEALS. THEIR COURT OF APPEALS IS ABOVE THEIR STATE SUPREME COURT. THE TRUMP TEAM FEELS LIKE THAT THEY HAVE A REALLY STRONG MEASURE ON APPEAL. NO DOUBT THAT THEY\u2019RE GOING TO TAKE EVERY PENNY OF THIS TO APPEAL. SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MEANTIME? A LOT HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD TAKING THE BUSINESS LICENSES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. WE\u2019LL SEE HOW THEY DO ON APPEAL. NO DOUBT THAT\u2019S WHAT THEY\u2019RE GOING TO DO. >> Martha: ARI, WHEN YOU VALUATE YOUR OWN PROPERTIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSURANCE OR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING A LOAN FROM A BANK, IT COMES WITH LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THIS IS OUR ASSESSMENT AND THE BANKS DO THEIR ASSESSMENTS ON HOW MUCH THE PROPERTY IS VALUED. IN NONE OF THOSE CASES INVOLVING THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION DID ANY OF THESE PARTIES BRING ANY LITIGATION AGAINST THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION FOR ANY FALSE REPRESENTATION. CORRECT? >> NO, THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. NOBODY HAS EVER ACCUSED ANY OF THESE NEW YORK BANKERS OR INSURANCE PEOPLE OF BEING BEHIND THE BALL. THESE GUYS ARE SHARP. THEY KNOW HOW TO SHARPEN THEIR PENCILS. ALL OF THIS IS WHY I PUT THIS IN THE POLITICAL CATEGORY, NOT A LEGAL CATEGORY. IT\u2019S ONE OF THE REASONS THE NORMS HAVE BROKEN DOWN IN THIS COUNTRY. WHEN THE DEMOCRATS GO TO THESE KINDS OF RESORTS TO GET SOMEBODY THEY DON\u2019T LIKE, WE ALL LOSE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM. IT\u2019S THE SAME THING AS TWO IMPEACHMENTS THAT VIOLATED THE RULES OF THE HOUSE. ALL TO GET THE MAN THEY DON\u2019T WANT. THE PERVERSE RESULT OF IT IS THEY\u2019LL GET THE MAN THEY DON\u2019T WANT. AS A RESULT, DONALD TRUMP LEAP FROGGED IN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. IF THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF TRUMP, THEY WOULDN\u2019T HAVE PROSECUTED HIM AND RON DESANTIS MAY HAVE HAD A CHANCE BACK IN JANUARY OF 2023. THESE INDICTMENTS LED TO THE RALLYING OF THE BASE BECAUSE OF THE WAY PEOPLE QUESTION JUSTICE, WHICH HAS BEEN A FOUR-YEAR PATTERN WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT. IT\u2019S THE MOST FOOLISH THING THE DEMOCRATS COULD DO UNLESS THEY WANT HIM TO RETURN TO POWER. >> Martha: YOU\u2019RE SO RIGHT. IGNORING THIS MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. YOU THINK ABOUT 91 INDICTMENTS AGAINST THIS INDIVIDUAL. SHANNON, LOOKING AT OTHER CIVIL CASES WHICH HAVE A MONETARY PRICE TAG ON THEM. THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL CASE HERE. I LOOKED BACK. O.J. SIMPSON WAS FOUND LIBEL IN THE DEATHS OF TWO PEOPLE, HIS WIFE AND NICOLE BROWN AND HER FRIEND. $33 MILLION. IN THE DEATHS OF TWO HUMAN BEINGS IN ONE OF THE MOST HIGH PROFILE CASES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? >> THEY WERE CLEARLY VICTIMS IN THAT CASE, WHICH GOES BACK TO THE ARGUMENT THAT NOBODY COMPLAINED. EVER GOT PAID BACK. SO REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE OUTCOME, WHEN THE PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE THIS ARGUMENT THAT IT\u2019S POLITICAL, IT LOOKS THAT WAY, ESPECIALLY WITH THE CLIPS YOU PLAYED EARLIER. SOMETHING INTERESTING TO KNOW. WE HAD OUT NOW FOX POLLING THIS WEEK. YOU AND I HAVE TALKED TO FOLKS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN THAT SAID THEY WOULD NOT MOVE AWAY FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP IF HE WAS INDICTED OR CONVICTED. THERE IS SOME SOFTENING THERE IF HE\u2019S CONVICTED ON A CRIMINAL CHARGE. THIS NEW POLLING THERE WE HAVE OUT OF CRITICAL STATES, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND MICHIGAN THIS WEEK, FOUND THAT MORE BIDEN SUPPORTERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIS MENTAL ACUTIE THAN TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIS LEGAL ISSUES. THIS WILL RALLY MOST OF THE BASE TO HIM. IT FORCED ALL OF HIS GOP RIVALS TO RUN TO HIS DEFENSE EVERY TIME HE WAS INDICTED. AS ARI POINTS OUT, IT CLEARED THE FIELD IN A DIFFERENT WAY. VOTERS SAY FOR THE MAJORITY, IT WON\u2019T MOVE THEM. THEY WON\u2019T WAIVER IN THE FACE OF VERDICTS LIKE THIS. >> Martha: YOU\u2019RE RIGHT, SHANNON. THERE\u2019S NO END  -- INDICATION THIS HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT, IF ANYTHING, IT HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT. WHEN THEY SEE HIM UNDER ATTACK, THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT\u2019S LIKE TO BE UNDER THE THUMB OF THE GOVERNMENT OR OF THE LAW IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND THEY RALLY we do have this decision we're waiting for the content of it it's 92 pages long it's no surprise that judge Arthur angron has found uh the former president Donald Trump liable in this case this is a civil case so this is about money not about criminality just to uh rewind a little bit here because there are a lot of different cases to keep track on but in this case Leticia James said when she was running for attorney general that she was going to get Trump and we're going to play some of what she said in a moment here but the decision is in it's 92 pages long James asked for $370 million in Damages she also wants him to be prevented from doing business in New York state so as we wait to download all of this and get a look at the number and as soon as we get it we'll tell you exactly what it is obviously this is something that the former president is watching extremely closely he has layers of judicial dates appointments decisions coming down all in the middle of the South Carolina primary which is coming up on February the 24th and and super Tuesday so all of this interwoven for former president Trump I want to bring in Ari fer former White House Press Secretary and Fox News contributor and Shannon Breen Fox News Sunday anchor and our chief legal correspondent uh Shannon let me start with you so no surprise obviously that that he was found liable because the judge found him liable before this case began correct correct and we are now looking at this of course I I jetted to the bottom to see what we can find in the conclusion and there are several big numbers in there the judge talks about in this um finding Donald Trump Donald Trump Jr Eric Trump Alan weiselberg and others involved in this um as you said had already decided that they had been fraudulent in some way one of the first things he orders is um that several of them together including Donald Trump and his trust in Trump organization will be uh have to pay $168 million and change the next paragraph goes on to say that there's another ruling for $126 million in change um another one for $60 million now we'll have to look and see if any of those are overlapping or if we add these up but these are some of the numbers coming out goes on to say that um Eric Trump has to pay $4 million in one case Donald Trump Jr $4 million in one of these cases and Alan weiselberg a million dollars so there's a lot there we're going to parse through these numbers but they are big we knew there was a big ask it looks like they may be um in the neighborhood of close to $300 million or more yeah um Shannon uh you know we are seeing this I believe this is a report we're all trying to sort of balance up these numbers here um but according to some of the reporting out there the number is 34.9 million and as you say the damages are spread across a number of the Trump family members who are deeply involved in the business Don Jr Eric Trump as you say $4 million now perhaps equally importantly according to the early reporting that we're seeing here the judge has banned Donald Trump and others from serving as an officer or director of any New York Corporation or other legal entity in New York for 3 years is the period here on this now that wouldn't have a whole lot of impact on on President Trump because he is running for president hopes to be president during that time but Eric Trump uh and Don Junior and and Eric uh in in a large way are very instrumental in the business here and it would it would prevent them from serving as an officer or director of any New York Corporation or other legal entity in New York for two years so three 54 M really 55 $355 million here in the Judgment from Arthur angaran against the former president Donald Trump Ari what's your reaction to all this you know Martha I just have such a hard time seeing any of the court cases including this one is anything other than a continuation of the resistance that began when Donald Trump was elected president and instantly protesters took to the streets of Fifth Avenue against Donald Trump to me when you look at all these cases the one thing they keep having in common is they're being brought against the former president in The Bluest of blue counties across the United States of America because if they were brought in a purple County let alone a red County they probably would have no chance of success whether it was a jury or a judge rendering a verdict and so I I just think this is a continuation of the nastiness that law has turned into to serve the political ends as Leticia James as you pointed out the Attorney General of New York campaigned on getting Donald Trump and I remember when she said that I'm a New Yorker I remember when she was a candidate and she vowed to do that and it struck me as an absolute miscarriage of Justice then when she made the promise and now that she's delivered on it it's even bigger Miss Carriage um this also the judge says that the Trump organization must install an independent director of compliance and says it's independent monitor shall continue in her role it says for at least three three years um Shannon you know of all the cases um that that have come against the former president this one I would say and the hush money Stormy Daniels case you know sort of was problematic in terms of the interpretation of a lot of people who study the law as you do now in this case none of the banks came forward none of these real estate investment companies came forward and said that the Trump organization failed to repay them they they they claimed that the Mar Lago estate for example was I believe eight worth $18 million which is preposterous for anybody who's looked for you know a cottage in Palm Beach you couldn't get one of those um in in that neighborhood so you know it's um it's really shocking how political this appears to be in going after him let's play those Leticia James comments when she was running for uh to to be the Attorney General watch this no one is above the law including this illegitimate president I look forward to going into the office of Attorney General every day suing him defending your rights and then going home I say one name Donald Trump that should motivate you will you will you sue him for us oh we're going to definitely sue him we're going to be a real pain in the he's going to know my name personally every time I see that Shannon um it's pretty shocking behavior from someone who you know wants to be a attorney general yeah and and the line she has there about nobody is above the law his folks will say nobody's below it either you cannot simply use the law as a cudle and go after somebody in a way that appears political This lends Credence to the argument that President Trump makes over and over that it's not just a prosecution these are persecutions and and his base is going to Rally to that every time this happens we got to remember too that as you noted there and as he continues to note there weren't quote victims here there weren't people that came forward and demanded Justice from the attorney general so in New York even though we're referring to this as the Supreme Court they have uh unusual language that they use in New York it's not their final court of appeal their court of appeals is actually above their state supreme court so the Trump team feels like on so many different counts they've got a really strong measure on appeal um no doubt that they're going to take every penny of this to appeal uh so what happens in the meantime a lot of this has been put on hold taking the business licenses and those kinds of things so we'll see how they do on appeal but no doubt that's what they're going to do yeah I mean Ari when you evaluate your own properties for the purpose of insurance or the purpose of getting a loan from A bank um it comes basically with language that says this is our assessment then the banks step in they do their assessment on how much the property is valued and in none of those cases involving the Trump organization did did any of these parties bring any litigation against the Trump Organization for any FSE false representation correct no that is exactly right and nobody has ever accused any of these New York Bankers or insurance people of being behind the ball I mean these guys are pretty sharp at what they do and they know how to sharpen their pencils so it all of this just is why I put this in a political category not a legal category it and it's just it's one of the reasons the Norms have broken down in this country because when the Democrats go to these kind of resorts to get somebody they don't like we all lose faith in the system you know it's the same thing as two impeachments that violated the rules of the house it's all just to get the man they don't want and the perverse result of it is they're going to get the man they don't want as a result of all these prosecutions Donald Trump leapfrogged in the Republican nomination if they had really wanted to get rid of trump they wouldn't have prosecuted him and then Rona santis actually may have had a chance back in January of 2023 but these indictments led to the rallying of the base because made people question Justice which has been a four-year pattern When Donald Trump was President so it's the most foolish thing that Democrats could do unless they want Donald Trump to return to power yeah you're so right I I mean you know ignoring some of this might have produced a different outcome uh when you think about 91 indictments against this individual and Shannon you know just looking at other civil cases which have a monetary um price tag on them as I said this is not a criminal case that he was in here I looked back OJ Simpson was found civil liable in the deaths of two people um his wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend who was at the property at the time $33 million in the deaths of two human beings in one of the most high-profile cases in American history yeah what do you think about that well there were clearly victims in that case which keeps going back to this argument about nobody complained everybody got paid back in this this case so regardless of how you feel about the outcome when the president former president and his supporters have this argument that it's political it certainly looks like way especially with the clips that you played earlier now something interesting to note we had out new Fox polling this week you and I on the road have talked to folks in New Hampshire and Iowa and everywhere in between who've said they would not move away from president Trump if he was indicted or convicted now there is some softening there if he's convicted on a criminal charge but this new polling we have out of critical States New Hampshire and Michigan this week found that more Biden supporters are worried about his mental acuity than Trump supporters are worried about his legal issues so again this will rally most of the base to him it forced all of his GOP Rivals to run to his defense every time he was indicted and um as Ari points out I mean it cleared the field in a very different way but voters say for the majority of Trump's supporters it's not going to move them they're not going to waver in the face of verdicts like this no you're absolutely right Shannon there's no indication in any of the polling that this has a negative impact on the Trump campaign and if anything it has a positive impact because when they see him under attack in some element of their own lives uh you know many people feel like they understand what it's like to be under the thumb of of the government or of the law in one way or the other um and they rally to him and and support him um which has been just a fascinating political phenomenon to watch I'm Steve duy I'm Brian kilme and I'm Angley aart and click here to subscribe to the Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis",

            "comment_text": "TRUMP HAS A PATH TO APPEAL WITHOUT POSTING A BOND.   No one talks about it.  But CPLR Article 5519 (c)  \"Stay and limitation of stay by court order. The court from or to which an appeal is taken or the court of original instance MAY STAY ALL PROCEEDINGS to enforce the judgment or order appealed from pending an appeal or determination on a motion for permission to appeal in a case not provided for in subdivision (a) or subdivision (b), or may grant a limited stay or may vacate, limit or modify any stay imposed by subdivision (a), subdivision (b) or this subdivision, except that only the court to which an appeal is taken may vacate, limit or modify a stay imposed by paragraph one of subdivision (a)\" I think I did one of these a long time ago - you have to show likelihood of success on the merits, balance of equities, prejudice if stay of X not granted, etc. \r\n\r\nWhile it isn't \"automatic\" like posting a bond, I think the circumstances here actually warrant the granting of a motion to stay of execution without the posting of a bond. Maybe they are planning on using that but just not talking about it? The standard for obtaining a discretionary stay under CPLR 5519(c) consists of meeting three requirements. (a) the likelihood of success on the merits, (b) irreparable injury in the absence of injunctive relief, and (c) the balancing of the equities between the parties. See Seitzman v. Hudson Riv. Assoc. (1st Dept. 1987) 126 A.D.2d 211 513 NYS 2d 148, Alexandru v. Pappas (2nd Dept. 2009) 68 A.D.3d 690; 890 N.Y.S.2d 593. \r\n\r\nI think if ever there was a case that cried out for a discretionary stay of execution, THIS IS IT!",

Trump should get one of his loyal business friends to buy Mar-a-Lago for $650 million to prove that the property is actually worth that much money. Then Trump should file a court case and appeal his penalty. Trump should demand $2 trillion dollars for his and his family's damage and suffering.",

Trump needs to look into taking the judge to court for his unsupportable and unqualified property estimates of real property.  This is so illegal it's a no brainer.",

Most businesses don't have a huge profit margin, maybe 20 percent is a good point for most. this trail points out that the common person would have to pay an additional 168 million (maybe more if you have less money the trump) in interest payments effectively eating away at the profit margin. So the extremely rich saves 168 million and can lower the cost of their widgets or use capitol in other ways to be more competitive while not affecting the profit margin. This means the extremely rich will most likely win in a competitive business every time. making the richest richer and keep the less rich in their place. Now Government (judge) is stepping in to help the billion dollar finance industry keep this borderline criminal process going. This should be the focus and the reason for outcry. Stop focusing on Trump and see how the rich get rich while the rich are left with scraps.",

            "comment_text": "DOJ & FBI covered up Biden family's corruption and ended up going to jail together, Democrats impeached Trump for more than 7 years and were removed from office 3 times related to Russia Hillary conspiracy theory, Pelosi played games January 6, 2021 44,000 Now the video has exposed the truth that Pelosi was kicked out of the Speaker's office by Henry McPartrick. The Communist Democratic Party accused Trump of tax evasion, but there is no evidence for the American people to believe that Trump is guilty. Because Joe Biden instructed the DOJ &FBI to put Trump in prison, Merrick Garland's political weapon took advantage of the DOJ's authority to appoint outside prosecutor Jack Smith without going through Congress. Jach Smith was not appointed by President Joe Biden, but let the DOJ call Jack Smith to take orders to go to Florida without any evidence or witnesses and charge 37 counts of violating the law under the constitution. Because President Trump has the right to declassify documents, and President Trump is not a spy or the cause of the 1918 war, the name Jach Smith is transferred to the January 6 rebellion instigated by Pelosi. The communist democratic party does not want Trump to run for President in 2024. Now everything has become clear, prosecutor Jack Smith probably graduated from jungle law school and has no way to resolve the slander against President Trump. Jack Smith will lose his lawyer's license forever, only the President has the right to appoint a prosecutor to investigate and approve the president of the National Assembly. DOJ Merrick Garland arbitrarily appointed Jack Smith to investigate former President Trump for wrongdoing in principle according to government executive agency regulations, and was prosecuted before the law for perceived wrongdoing in political games, When people asked Jack Smith, when Joe Biden was Vice President, why did he bring secret documents home and keep them for more than 7 years and did not hand them over to the National Documents Archives Committee before January 20, 2017? Joe Biden said he forgot. In the Garage, don't forget to hand over the Delaware University Library to the National Archives Commission. Joe Biden was discovered to have hidden documents in his house, full evidence. Joe Biden spoke in a childish manner, when Only when a baby cries, the mother breastfeeds, the political game of the Communist Democratic Party is shamefully exposed. Vice President Biden has no right to reveal secrets and keep secret documents in the Garage or library, if Joe Biden is convicted of a crime Revealing national secret information is a crime of treason. Jack Smith has no way to answer but only listens to the American people criticizing prosecutor Jack Smith for declaring his determination to prosecute President Trump without evidence. Jack Smith is now in turmoil when Congress asked Jack Smith to hand over documents indicting Trump. He didn't know what he was doing, but only received orders from DOJ Merrick Garland, and Jack Smith asked DC judge Chutkan Tanya to prosecute Trump. is slander, Jack Smith applied false constitutional and legal charges when Trump filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court regarding freedom of speech under Article 1 of the Constitutional Amendment, the Court asked the judge Chutkan Tanya drops charges against Trump. Chutkan Tanya violated the US Constitution. She had to withdraw her accusation. It was so embarrassing",

He could still do that now, but he's too dumb to figure it out.  I don't have a genius level IQ, but I was able to figure it out all on my own!!  If we don't have that written guarantee, then every \"trial\" is one of two things, either it is a pure gamble, or it is a scam that is being run on us!  Look up my paper about The UNIVERSAL Get Out Of Jail For Free Card! and read it and then use it!!",

Trump is turning his back on NATO, and Ukraine, which is making Putin happy. I am a republican, but republicans never acted like this. He thought he could negotiate with them, but he got used.",

So why not spend 5 seconds on telling us that, plus informing us as to how soon he can appeal and how long will that process take.

The defendants won't be found guilty but still liable because who isn't going to deny the accusation (every innocent person).\n The corrupt cabal has started relieving the middle-class and more wealthy of their personal properties (remember 2008 housing bank scams) and during covid many businesses and homes were lost due to the impact of the lockdown. Due to the manufactured inflation, many businesses can't stay afloat. And, now the tyrants say they can decide to just end an empire worth billions because they don't like the owners. Imagine if they just covet and want your wealth. For all those marching lockstep with this travesty like it's  a parade and rejoicing at your opponents' misfortunes, what you facilitate and tolerate will become your resting place.\nKarma never forgets an address. What you sow, you will reap. Actions have consequences.",

Because they invented evidence.<br><br>So the prosecutors of the four indictments have spelt out very carefully for the American people the facts on which they are choosing to rely to convict him.  Worth a look.  If 10% of this is true he will be going yo prison for a long time.  Some of it will not be challenged.  That is recorded fact \u2026 actual recordings and receipts \u2026 not held up as such in congressional hearings where you can say what you want (aka Biden hearing debacle) but in an actual court of law where lawyers are disbarred for making false statements.  The indictments are, in my estimate, 80% provable.  Some things will be harder to prove \u2026 they are probably true but may not carry the onus of the burden of proof on the day.  But the vast majority of the evidence cannot be dismissed as it is recorded, unadorned fact.",
