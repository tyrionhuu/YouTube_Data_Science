trump has a path to appeal without posting a bond no one talks about it but cplr article 5519 c stay and limitation of stay by court order the court from or to which an appeal is taken or the court of original instance may stay all proceedings to enforce the judgment or order appealed from pending an appeal or determination on a motion for permission to appeal in a case not provided for in subdivision a or subdivision b or may grant a limited stay or may vacate limit or modify any stay imposed by subdivision a subdivision b or this subdivision except that only the court to which an appeal is taken may vacate limit or modify a stay imposed by paragraph one of subdivision a i think i did one of these a long time ago you have to show likelihood of success on the merits balance of equities prejudice if stay of x not granted etc while it isnt automatic like posting a bond i think the circumstances here actually warrant the granting of a motion to stay of execution without the posting of a bond maybe they are planning on using that but just not talking about it the standard for obtaining a discretionary stay under cplr 5519c consists of meeting three requirements a the likelihood of success on the merits b irreparable injury in the absence of injunctive relief and c the balancing of the equities between the parties see seitzman v hudson riv assoc 1st dept 1987 126 ad2d 211 513 nys 2d 148 alexandru v pappas 2nd dept 2009 68 ad3d 690 890 nys2d 593 i think if ever there was a case that cried out for a discretionary stay of execution this is it,0.9563,0.08410714285714287

most people in business already know that the extremely wealthy have an unfair advantage ie if you are extremely wealthy more than trump apparently you can save 168 million dollars on interest payments most businesses dont have a huge profit margin maybe 20 percent is a good point for most this trail points out that the common person would have to pay an additional 168 million maybe more if you have less money the trump in interest payments effectively eating away at the profit margin so the extremely rich saves 168 million and can lower the cost of their widgets or use capitol in other ways to be more competitive while not affecting the profit margin this means the extremely rich will most likely win in a competitive business every time making the richest richer and keep the less rich in their place now government judge is stepping in to help the billion dollar finance industry keep this borderline criminal process going this should be the focus and the reason for outcry stop focusing on trump and see how the rich get rich while the rich are left with scraps,0.9919,0.27291666666666664
